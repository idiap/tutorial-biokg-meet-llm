The incidence of CNS infection and the use of antibiotics.\nForty-six cases of basilar skull fractures in children were reviewed to determine the incidence of CNS infection following injury and the possible value of antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis. The clinical course of the children who were treated with antibiotics was compared with that of patients who received no antimicrobial therapy. Included in the study were patients with hemotympanum alone or with hemotympanum plus additional clinical or roentgenographic signs of basilar skull fracture; patients with tympanic membrane perforation without otorrhea but with blood in the auditory canal; and children with either otorrhea or rhinorrhea. Acute, delayed, or recurrent infection of the CNS did not develop in any of the patients. This study is the first of its kind presented in children. It would seem on the basis of the present series that the systematic use of antibiotic prophylaxis in children with hemotympanum following basilar skull fractures is unwarranted and that children with other signs of basilar skull fractures may have an equally small risk of meningitis following injury."

After discontinuation of propofol the discolouration of the liver disappeared. This phenomenon is due to metabolism of propofol which may lead to a phenolic green chromophore which is conjugated in the liver and excreted in the urine."

Plain skull X-ray film showed a large osteolytic lesion in the left temporo-parietal bone. Bone and Ga scintigrams revealed an increased activity in this lesion. CT scan demonstrated an isodense lentiform configuration, which was homogeneously enhanced with contrast medium. It was iso-intense in T1, and high-intense in T2 and proton weighted MR images. The tumor was removed en bloc with surrounding normal bone. The attached dura was markedly thickened, but there was no tumor infiltration. Histological diagnosis was transitional meningioma with psammoma body. Postoperatively he was transferred back to Okinawa Hospital and right lower lobectomy was performed for the lung tumor. Histological diagnosis was well-differentiated adenocarcinoma. We examined immunohistochemically p53 protein expression, but p53 immunoactivity was observed in neither tumor. Multiple neoplasms associated with brain tumor are relatively rare, but the incidence will increase in the future as the diagnostic work-up develops. Pathological diagnosis will give us the decisive opportunity for proper treatment. It is to be stressed that, in multiple neoplasms, care should be taken to avoid misdiagnosis of metastasis."

Pathogenesis remained uncertain until recently Gitelman's syndrome, the hypokalemic-hypomagnesemic variant with hypocalciuria, was linked to the gene encoding the thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl-cotransporter (TSC) located on chromosome 16q. Various mutations in the TSC gene were identified in patients with Gitelman's syndrome. To clarify whether different forms of hypokalemic tubular disorders (HTD) represent variable phenotypes of a common genetic defect, we performed linkage analyses in 17 families with different symptoms of HTD with four highly polymorphic chromosome 16 DNA markers closely linked to the TSC gene. Linkage of Gitelman's syndrome to the TSC locus was confirmed in our families with a maximum two-point Lod score Z = 4.70 (theta = 0.001) for marker locus D16S526. Highly negative LOD scores were obtained at this locus in our families with classic Bartter's syndrome (Z = 9.89, theta = 0.001) and hyperprostaglandin E syndrome (Z = -11.24, theta = 0.001).

This \"euthyroid sick syndrome\" may be an adaptive response to conserve energy. However, thyroid hormone also has beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system, such as improving cardiac function, reducing systemic vascular resistance, and lowering serum cholesterol levels. We investigated whether thyroid hormone levels obtained at the time of myocardial infarction are associated with subsequent mortality. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Serum levels of thyroid hormones (triiodothyronine [T3], reverse T3, free thyroxine [T4], and thyroid-stimulating hormone) were measured in 331 consecutive patients with acute myocardial infarction (mean age [+/- SD], 68 +/- 12 years), from samples obtained at the time of admission. RESULTS: Fifty-three patients (16%) died within 1 year. Ten percent (16 of 165) of patients with reverse T3 levels (an inactive metabolite) >0.41 nmol/L (the median value) died within the first week after myocardial infarction, compared with none of the 166 patients with lower levels (P <0.0004). After 1 year, the corresponding figures were 24% (40 of 165) versus 7.8% (13 of 166; P <0.0001). Reverse T3 levels >0.41 nmol/L were associated with an increased risk of 1-year mortality (hazard ratio = 3.0; 95% confidence interval: 1.4 to 6.3; P = 0.005), independent of age, previous myocardial infarction, prior angina, heart failure, serum creatinine level, and peak serum creatine kinase-MB fraction levels. CONCLUSION: Determination of reverse T3 levels may be a valuable and simple aid to improve identification of patients with myocardial infarction who are at high risk of subsequent mortality."

The present study was designed to investigate the cytotoxic potential of curcumin against a range of human tumor cell lines in an attempt to understand its mechanism of action, which may lead to its possible therapeutic applications. We have shown that different cancer cell lines differ in their sensitivity to curcumin. Cell lines established from malignancies like leukemia, breast, colon, hepatocellular, and ovarian carcinomas underwent apoptosis in the presence of curcumin, whereas cell lines from lung, kidney, prostate, cervix, CNS malignancies, and melanomas showed resistance to the cytotoxic effects of curcumin. Sensitivity of the cancer cell lines to curcumin correlated with the generation of superoxide radicals as determined by the reduction of ferricytochrome C. Curcumin-resistant tumor cell lines showed significantly higher production of Hsp70, thus mounting a stress response and protecting the cells from the apoptotic cell death. These observations yield clues toward understanding the regulation of the cell death machinery by the stress proteins. Interestingly, curcumin had no effect on nontransformed cell lines, which showed neither superoxide generation nor the induction of a stress response. These observations demonstrate that curcumin is an interesting molecule with varied actions, depending on the cell type."

Both trophoblasts and endometrial epithelial cells express trophinin, which mediates apical cell adhesion through homophilic trophinin-trophinin binding. We hypothesized that trophinin's function in embryo implantation is unique to humans and investigated the expression of trophinin, tastin, and bystin in ectopic pregnancy, a condition unique to humans. In tubal pregnancies, high levels of all three were found in both trophoblasts and fallopian tubal epithelia. Trophinin expression in maternal cells was particularly high in the area adjacent to the trophoblasts, whereas trophinin was barely detectable in intact fallopian tubes from women with in utero pregnancies or without pregnancies. When explants of intact fallopian tube were incubated with the human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG), trophinin expression was enhanced in epithelial cells. Since the trophectoderm of the human blastocyst secretes hCG before and after implantation, these results suggest that hCG from the human embryo induces trophinin expression by maternal cells. As both beta-subunit of hCG and trophinin genes have diverged in mammals, the present study suggests a unique role of hCG and trophinin in human embryo implantation, including the pathogenesis of ectopic pregnancy."

Caspase-3, -8, -9, and -10 inhibitors partially reversed the cell death induced by dracorhodin perchlorate. Caspase-3 and -8 were activated, followed by the degradation of caspase-3 substrates, the inhibitor of caspase-activated DNase, and poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase. Dracorhodin perchlorate upregulated the expression ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 and significantly increased the expression of p53 and p21(WAF1) proteins. The cell death was partially reduced by the mitogen-activated protein kinase c-JUN NH2-terminal protein kinase (JNK MAPK) inhibitor (SP600125) and p38 MAPK inhibitor (SB 203580), while the MEK inhibitor (PD98059) augmented cell death; the drug induced sustained phosphorylation of JNK and p38 MAPK. Moreover, the Fas agonistic antibody CH-11 has a synergistic effect with dracorhodin perchlorate. The phoshatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) family inhibitor wortmanin and tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein rescued the viability loss induced by dracohodin perchlorate.

We recently reported that plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) are elevated in HIV-1-infected patients and that they correlate with viral load. The present study investigates the expression of TRAIL death receptor 5 (DR5) in the peripheral-blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of HIV-1-infected patients and its role in CD4(+) T-cell death. DR5 expression was elevated and associated with the apoptotic marker annexin V. Apoptosis was reduced in CD4(+) T cells when cultured with anti-DR5 antibody. CD4(+), but not CD8(+), T cells from uninfected donors expressed TRAIL, DR5, and activated caspase-3 when cultured with infectious or noninfectious HIV-1, resulting in preferential apoptosis of CD4(+) T cells. TRAIL, caspase-3 expression, and apoptosis were type 1 interferon (IFN) dependent. Induction of apoptosis and DR5 expression required glycoprotein 120 (gp120)-CD4 interaction. Finally, we analyzed DR5 expression by CD4(+) T cells in highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)-treated patients. The decreased viral loads and increased CD4 counts of HAART-responsive patients were associated with a decrease in DR5 mRNA expression by CD4(+) T lymphocytes. We propose a novel model in which a type 1 IFN-regulated TRAIL /DR5 mechanism induces apoptosis of HIV-1-exposed CD4(+) T cells."

To gain insight into the role of FA gene inactivation occurring in tumors among the general population, we endogenously targeted in cancer cells four FA genes that act at different stages of the FA pathway. After successful mono-allelic deletion of all genes, the sequential homozygous deletion was achieved only for FANCC and FANCG, acting upstream, but not for BRCA2 or FANCD2, acting downstream in the FA pathway. Targeting of the second allele in in BRCA2 and FANCD2 heterozygote clones resulted in redeletion exclusively of the already defective allele in multiple instances (13x concerning BRCA2, 25x concerning FANCD2), strongly suggesting a detrimental phenotype. Unlike complete FANCD2 disruption, the mere reduction of FANCD2 protein levels had no discernible effect. In addition, we confirmed that human cancer cells harboring the Seckel ATR mutation display impaired FANCD2 monoubiquitination and FANCD2 nuclear focus formation, as well as an increased sensitivity to DNA interstrand-crosslinking agents. Nevertheless, these cells were viable, indicating an ATR-independent function of FANCD2, distinct from its major known functions, to be responsible for the detrimental effects of FANCD2 loss. In conclusion, we established the downstream FA genes FANCD2 and BRCA2 to represent particularly vulnerable parts of the FA pathway, providing direct evidence for the paradoxical assumption that their inactivation could be predominantly selected against in cancer cells. This would explain why certain FA gene defects, despite an apparent selection for FA pathway inactivation in cancer, are rarely observed in tumors among the general population."

        "text": "Inhibition of tumor angiogenesis by p53: a new role for the guardian of the genome.\nThe p53 tumor suppressor protein has long been recognized as the central factor protecting humans from cancer. It has been famously dubbed \"the guardian of the genome\" due to its ability to respond to genotoxic stress, such as DNA damage and other stress signals, and to protect the genome by inducing a variety of biological responses including DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis. However, the tumor suppressive effects of p53 go far beyond its roles in mediating these three processes. There is growing evidence that p53 also exerts its effects on multiple aspects of tumor formation, including suppression of metastasis and, as summarized in this review, inhibition of new blood vessel development (angiogenesis). The p53 protein has been shown to limit angiogenesis by at least three mechanisms: (1) interfering with central regulators of hypoxia that mediate angiogenesis, (2) inhibiting production of proangiogenic factors, and (3) directly increasing the production of endogenous angiogenesis inhibitors. The combination of these effects allows p53 to efficiently shut down the angiogenic potential of cancer cells. Inactivation of p53, which occurs in approximately half of all tumors, reverses these effects; as a consequence, tumors carrying p53 mutations appear more vascularized and are often more aggressive and correlate with poor prognosis for treatment. Thus, the loss of functional p53 during tumorigenesis likely represents an essential step in the switch to an angiogenic phenotype that is displayed by aggressive tumors."

Systematic evaluation of the genome-wide SNPs is expected to provide breakthroughs in the understanding of complex diseases. In this study, we developed a new systematic method for mapping multiple loci and applied the proposed method to construct a genetic network for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) via analysis of 746 multiplex families genotyped with more than five thousands of genome-wide SNPs. We successfully identified 41 significant SNPs relevant to RA, 25 associated genes and a number of important SNP-SNP interactions (SNP patterns). Many findings (loci, genes and interactions) have experimental support from previous studies while novel findings may define unknown genetic pathways for this complex disease. Finally, we constructed a genetic network by integrating the results from this analysis with the rapidly accumulated knowledge in biomedical domains, which gave us a more detailed insight onto the RA etiology. The results suggest that the proposed systematic method is powerful when applied to genome-wide association studies. Integrating the analysis of high-throughput SNP data with knowledge-based SNP functional annotation offers a promising way to reversely engineer the underlying genetic networks for complex human diseases."

Hysterectomy is a common approach to treating uterine fibroids, and less invasive surgical approaches such as myomectomy and uterine artery embolization also have been shown to alleviate symptoms. Magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound surgery (MRgFUS) is the only totally non-invasive surgical approved method for treating uterine fibroids. In clinical trials, MRgFUS resulted in significant relief of uterine fibroid symptoms. The safe and effective use of MRgFUS is affected by fibroid type and location, position relative to adjacent anatomical structures and the presence of co-existent pelvic disease. Additionally, successful outcomes with MRgFUS have been correlated with the volume of fibroids ablated during the procedure. Thus, selection of patients in whom sufficient fibroid volumes can be treated safely using the MRgFUS system is critical for successful outcomes. The MR images in this pictorial essay provide examples of uterine fibroids for which MRgFUS should be considered and is designed to facilitate the selection of patients for whom MRgFUS is most likely to provide sustained symptom relief."

PTEN is the second most frequently mutated gene in human cancer after p53. Germline mutations of PTEN have been found in cancer susceptibility syndromes, such as Cowden syndrome, in which over 80% of patients have mutations of PTEN. Homozygous deletion of Pten causes embryonic lethality, suggesting that PTEN is essential for embryonic development. Mice heterozygous for Pten develop spontaneous tumors in a variety of organs comparable with the spectrum of its mutations in human cancer. The mechanisms of PTEN functions in tumor suppression are currently under intense investigation. Recent studies demonstrate that PTEN plays an essential role in the maintenance of chromosomal stability and that loss of PTEN leads to massive alterations of chromosomes. The tumor suppressor p53 is known as a guardian of the genome that mediates the cellular response to environmental stress, leading to cell cycle arrest or cell death. Through completely different mechanisms, PTEN also protects the genome from instability. Thus, we propose that PTEN is a new guardian of the genome.

The expression and activity of ADAM17 increase under some pathological conditions such as stroke and glioma. ADAM17 promotes neural progenitor cell migration and contributes to stroke-induced neurogenesis after stroke and brain tumor growth and invasion. In the present study, we sought to elucidate whether ADAM17 contributes to breast cancer progression and its mechanisms. To this end, we examined the role of ADAM17 in the proliferation, invasion and tube formation of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells in vitro. Stable transfection of the MDA-MB-231 cell line with either a plasmid for overexpression of human ADAM17, or a siRNA to ADAM17 was employed in this study to establish high or low ADAM17 expression in breast cancer cells, respectively. For study of mechanism, the ADAM17 inhibitor TAPI-2 and the PI3K-AKT inhibitor LY294002 were used to counteract high ADAM17 expression or the activated PI3K-AKT pathway. Proliferation of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were tested by MTT, Bromodeoxyuridine incorporation assay, growth curve and sulforhodamine B assay. Matrigel invasion assays were used to assess the ability of MDA-MB-231 cells to penetrate the Extra Cellular Matrix. A Matrigel tube formation assay was performed to test capillary tube formation ability. EGFR-PI3K-Akt pathway activation in MDA-MB-231 cells under different ADAM17 expression levels were tested by western blot and ELISA. Our data show that ADAM17 promotes the MDA-MB-231 malignant phenotype by increased proliferation, invasion and angiogenesis. TGFalpha, VEGF secretion and VEGF expression was increasing by ADAM17 and counteracted by ADAM17 siRNA, TAPI-2 and LY294002 in MDA-MB-231 cells. ADAM17 activated, whereas ADAM17 siRNA, TAPI-2 and LY294002 deactivated the EGFR-PI3K-AKT signal pathway, which correlated with MDA-MB-231 cell malignant phenotype changes.

METHOD: A retrospective review was undertaken of consecutive cases undergoing fetoscopic directed laser surgery for TTTS between October 2006 and November 2008 at Texas Children's Fetal Center, in which an absorbable gelatin sponge, used as a chorioamnion 'plug', was placed at the conclusion of the intervention as a possible prophylactic measure to prevent PPROM. We excluded cases that had a failure of plug placement and those in which it was not attempted. PPROM was defined as rupture of membranes before 34 weeks' gestation. A comparison was performed between the PPROM group and a no-PPROM group to determine risk factors and outcomes. RESULTS: Successful plug placement occurred in 79 of 84 cases (94%) in which it was attempted after laser surgery, with a rate of PPROM of 34% in these patients. PPROM occurred at an average gestational age of 26.5 +/- 3.6 weeks, with an average procedure-to-PPROM interval of 5.2 +/- 3.5 weeks. There were no statistically significant differences between the PPROM group and the no-PPROM group in maternal demographics or preoperative parameters including: amniotic fluid volumes in the recipient twin's gestational sac, volume of amnioreduction, and location of the placenta. The procedure-to-delivery interval for the total cohort (n = 79) was 9.2 +/- 4.7 weeks, without a significant difference between the two groups (P = 0.08). However, after exclusion of one PPROM outlier, the PPROM group had an average procedure-to-delivery time 2 weeks shorter than the group with no PPROM (P = 0.03). The live birth rates were similar in the PPROM and no-PPROM groups, at 77 and 73%, respectively. However, the average recipient's weight in the PPROM group was significantly lower than in the no-PPROM group (1321 +/- 493 vs. 1705 +/- 576 g; P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: The rate of PPROM and the mean gestational age at delivery in pregnancies in which an absorbable gelatin sponge was used as a sealant of the fetoscopic port following laser photocoagulation for TTTS were comparable to those that have been reported by other laser centers where membrane sealants were not used. A randomized controlled trial should be considered to evaluate the effect of chorioamnion plugging."

Recent work in nematodes has demonstrated that the identity of genes within operons is highly conserved among species and that the unifying feature of genes within operons is that they are expressed in germline tissue. However, it is generally unknown what processes are responsible for generating the distribution of operon sizes across the genome, which are composed of up to eight genes per operon. Here we investigate several models for operon evolution to better understand their abundance, distribution of sizes, and evolutionary dynamics over time. We find that birth-death models of operon evolution reasonably describe the relative abundance of operons of different sizes in the C. elegans and Ciona genomes and generate predictions about the number of monocistronic, nonoperon genes that likely participate in the birth-death process. This theory, and applications to C. elegans and Ciona, motivates several new and testable hypotheses about eukaryote operon evolution."

Of 34 SNPs selected for replication, 7 new rheumatoid arthritis risk alleles were identified at genome-wide significance (P < 5 x 10(-8)) in an analysis of all 41,282 samples. The associated SNPs are near genes of known immune function, including IL6ST, SPRED2, RBPJ, CCR6, IRF5 and PXK. We also refined associations at two established rheumatoid arthritis risk loci (IL2RA and CCL21) and confirmed the association at AFF3. These new associations bring the total number of confirmed rheumatoid arthritis risk loci to 31 among individuals of European ancestry. An additional 11 SNPs replicated at P < 0.05, many of which are validated autoimmune risk alleles, suggesting that most represent genuine rheumatoid arthritis risk alleles."

In August 2006, the Neonatology Department at Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, introduced total body cooling for infants born at term with HIE. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective study comprises data from medical records of newborn children born with HIE during a period of 32 months. Relevant data for cooling were recorded. Structured neurological examinations were carried out on survivors when they were ten and or 18 months old. RESULTS: A total of 32 infants fulfilled the criteria for cooling, the incidence being 0.4/1000 births. Twenty infants were cooled for 72 hours. Eleven infants had cooling discontinued before 72 hours because of their grave prognosis. One infant had cooling discontinued because of pulmonary hypertension. Most infants were cooled before six hours of age (median four hours). The mortality rate was 41%. A total of 45% were cooled without being placed in a ventilator. The side effects were of no major concern. Eight children had a neurological follow-up. One child had developed cerebral palsy and two children suffered delayed development. CONCLUSION: Total body cooling was carried out before six hours of age in the vast majority of infants born with HIE. Side effects were of less concern. Respiratory support with a ventilator could be avoided in 45% of the infants cooled for 72 hours. The mortality rate was 41%."

Proteins that are destined for proteasome-mediated degradation are usually tagged with a chain of ubiquitin linked via lysine (K) 48 that targets them to the proteolytic machinery. However, when the proteasome becomes compromised in its function, it is attractive to think that the cell may switch to an alternative, non-proteolytic form of ubiquitination that could help divert cargo proteins away from an otherwise overloaded proteasome. Of the several types of ubiquitin chain topologies, K63-linked ubiquitination is the only one known to fulfil diverse proteasome-independent roles, including DNA repair, endocytosis and NFkappaB signaling. By virtue of its apparent dissociation from the proteasome, we have originally proposed that K63-linked ubiquitination may be involved in cargo diversion during proteasomal stress and accordingly, in the biogenesis of inclusion bodies associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we provide an overview of this non-classic form of ubiquitin modification, and discuss current evidence and controversies surrounding our proposed role for K63 polyubiquitin as a key regulator of inclusion dynamics that is relevant to neurodegeneration.

CaMKII regulates intracellular Ca(2+) handling proteins as well as sarcolemmal Na(+) channels. We hypothesized that CaMKII also contributes to diastolic dysfunction and arrhythmias via augmentation of the late Na(+) current (late I(Na)) in early HF (8-week-old TG mice). Echocardiography revealed severe diastolic dysfunction in addition to decreased systolic ejection fraction. Premature arrhythmogenic contractions (PACs) in isolated isometrically twitching papillary muscles only occurred in TG preparations (5 vs. 0, P < 0.05) which could be completely terminated when treated with the late I(Na) inhibitor ranolazine (Ran, 5 mumol/L). Force-frequency relationships revealed significantly reduced twitch force amplitudes in TG papillary muscles. Most importantly, diastolic tension increased with raising frequencies to a greater extent in TG papillary muscles compared to WT specimen (at 10 Hz: 3.7 +- 0.4 vs. 2.5 +- 0.3 mN/mm2; P < 0.05). Addition of Ran improved diastolic dysfunction to 2.1 +- 0.2 mN/mm2 (at 10 Hz; P < 0.05) without negative inotropic effects. Mechanistically, the late I(Na) was markedly elevated in myocytes isolated from TG mice and could be completely reversed by Ran. In conclusion, our results show for the first time that TG CaMKIIdelta(C) overexpression induces diastolic dysfunction and arrhythmogenic triggers possibly via an enhanced late I(Na). Inhibition of elevated late I(Na) had beneficial effects on arrhythmias as well as diastolic function in papillary muscles from CaMKIIdelta(C) TG mice. Thus, late I(Na) inhibition appears to be a promising option for diastolic dysfunction and arrhythmias in HF where CaMKII is found to be increased."

Here we present evidence that phosphatidylserine (PS) is a relevant binding molecule for human SP-A. The binding is Ca(2+)-dependent and is not inhibited by mannose, suggesting that the sugar-binding site of the carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) of SP-A is not involved. Flow cytometry studies on apoptotic Jurkat cells revealed apparent inhibition of annexin V binding by increasing concentrations of SP-A in late apoptotic but not early apoptotic cells, and this was consistent for Jurkat cells and neutrophils. Supporting these data, confocal microscopy results show a co-localisation of annexin V and SP-A in late apoptotic but not early apoptotic cells. However, we cannot conclude that this inhibition is exclusively due to the binding of SP-A to PS on the cell surface, as annexin V is not wholly specific for PS and SP-A also interacts with other phospholipids that might become exposed on the apoptotic cell surface."

METHODS: Recently, a phase I/II trial of everolimus demonstrated significant reductions in subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) volume and decreased seizure frequency. Subgroup analysis was performed on DTI data available from this study. TSC patients with SEGA received everolimus, titrated to tolerability to achieve target trough concentrations of 5-15 ng/mL. DTI (1.5 T, 15 directions) was used to calculate fractional anisotropy (FA) and axial, radial, and mean diffusivity within regions of interest (ROIs). Baseline scans were compared to 12-18 months post-treatment and compared to a TSC age- and gender-matched nontreatment control cohort. RESULTS: Of 28 enrolled patients, 20 had sufficient DTI data. Comparing baseline values with those acquired 12-18 months after treatment, a significant change in FA was observed in the corpus callosum, internal capsule, and geniculo-calcarine region (p < 0.05). Mean change in FA was 0.04 (p < 0.01), driven primarily by a significant decrease in radial diffusivity. Mean diffusivity of the combined ROIs decreased slightly (p < 0.05), axial diffusivity remained stable. The control group showed no change over time. CONCLUSION: Significant changes in FA and radial diffusivity were observed after treatment with everolimus in patients with TSC, suggesting that the genetic defect of TSC in the brain may be modified pharmacologically, even in normal-appearing white matter."

A separate trial, J-ROCKET AF, compared the safety of a Japan-specific rivaroxaban dose with warfarin administered according to Japanese guidelines in Japanese patients with AF. METHODS AND RESULTS: J-ROCKET AF was a prospective, randomized, double-blind, phase III trial. Patients (n=1,280) with non-valvular AF at increased risk for stroke were randomized to receive 15 mg once-daily rivaroxaban or warfarin dose-adjusted according to Japanese guidelines. The primary objective was to determine non-inferiority of rivaroxaban against warfarin for the principal safety outcome of major and non-major clinically relevant bleeding, in the on-treatment safety population. The primary efficacy endpoint was the composite of stroke and systemic embolism. Non-inferiority of rivaroxaban to warfarin was confirmed; the rate of the principal safety outcome was 18.04% per year in rivaroxaban-treated patients and 16.42% per year in warfarin-treated patients (hazard ratio [HR] 1.11; 95% confidence interval 0.87-1.42; P<0.001 [non-inferiority]). Intracranial hemorrhage rates were 0.8% with rivaroxaban and 1.6% with warfarin. There was a strong trend for a reduction in the rate of stroke/systemic embolism with rivaroxaban vs. warfarin (HR, 0.49; P=0.050). CONCLUSIONS: J-ROCKET AF demonstrated the safety of a Japan-specific rivaroxaban dose and supports bridging the global ROCKET AF results into Japanese clinical practice."

An ideal system to study the role of Tet2 in myelopoeisis is CEBPalpha-induced transdifferentiation of pre-B cells into macrophages. Here we found that CEBPalpha binds to upstream regions of Tet2 and that the gene becomes activated. Tet2 knockdowns impaired the upregulation of macrophage markers as well as phagocytic capacity, suggesting that the enzyme is required for both early and late stage myeloid differentiation. A slightly weaker effect was seen in primary cells with a Tet2 ablation. Expression arrays of transdifferentiating cells with Tet2 knockdowns permitted the identification of a small subset of myeloid genes whose upregulation was blunted. Activation of these target genes was accompanied by rapid increases of promoter hydroxy-methylation. Our observations indicate that Tet2 helps CEBPalpha rapidly derepress myeloid genes during the conversion of pre-B cells into macrophages."

In the brain, growth of subependymal giant cell astrocytomas can cause life-threatening symptoms--eg, hydrocephalus, requiring surgery. In an open-label, phase 1/2 study, the mTOR inhibitor everolimus substantially and significantly reduced the volume of subependymal giant cell astrocytomas. We assessed the efficacy and safety of everolimus in patients with subependymal giant cell astrocytomas associated with tuberous sclerosis complex. METHODS: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial, patients (aged 0-65 years) in 24 centres in Australia, Belgium, Canada, Germany, the UK, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Russian Federation, and the USA were randomly assigned, with an interactive internet-response system, in a 2:1 ratio to oral everolimus 4 5 mg/m(2) per day (titrated to achieve blood trough concentrations of 5-15 ng/mL) or placebo. Eligible patients had a definite diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis complex and at least one lesion with a diameter of 1 cm or greater, and either serial growth of a subependymal giant cell astrocytoma, a new lesion of 1 cm or greater, or new or worsening hydrocephalus. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with confirmed response--ie, reduction in target volume of 50% or greater relative to baseline in subependymal giant cell astrocytomas. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00789828. FINDINGS: 117 patients were randomly assigned to everolimus (n=78) or placebo (n=39). 27 (35%) patients in the everolimus group had at least 50% reduction in the volume of subependymal giant cell astrocytomas versus none in the placebo group (difference 35%, 95% CI 15-52; one-sided exact Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test, p<0 0001). Adverse events were mostly grade 1 or 2; no patients discontinued treatment because of adverse events. The most common adverse events were mouth ulceration (25 [32%] in the everolimus group vs two [5%] in the placebo group), stomatitis (24 [31%] vs eight [21%]), convulsion (18 [23%] vs ten [26%]), and pyrexia (17 [22%] vs six [15%]). INTERPRETATION: These results support the use of everolimus for subependymal giant cell astrocytomas associated with tuberous sclerosis. Additionally, everolimus might represent a disease-modifying treatment for other aspects of tuberous sclerosis. FUNDING: Novartis Pharmaceuticals."

Although histone modifications are not necessarily prerequisite codes, they may still serve as good epigenetic indicators of chromatin state associated with gene activation or repression. In particular, six emerging classes of histone H3 modifications are subjected for epigenome profiling by the International Human Epigenome Consortium. In general, transcription start sites of actively transcribed genes are marked by trimethylated H3K4 (H3K4me3) and acetylated H3K27 (H3K27ac), and active enhancers can be identified by enrichments of both monomethylated H3K4 (H3K4me1) and H3K27ac. Gene bodies of actively transcribed genes are associated with trimethylated H3K36 (H3K36me3). Gene repression can be mediated through two distinct mechanisms involving trimethylated H3K9 (H3K9me3) and trimethylated H3K27 (H3K27me3). Enrichments of these histone modifications on specific loci, or in genome wide, in given cells can be analyzed by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-based methods using an antibody directed against the site-specific modification. When performing ChIP experiments, one should be careful about the specificity of antibody, as this affects the data interpretation. If cell samples with preserved histone-DNA contacts are available, evaluation of histone modifications, in addition to DNA methylaion, at specific gene loci would be useful for deciphering the epigenome state for human genetics studies.

METHODS: In 168 consecutive ischemic stroke patients, plasma levels of MR-proADM were measured within 24 hours from symptom onset. Functional outcome was assessed by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 90 days following stroke. Logistic regression, receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis, net reclassification improvement (NRI), and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis were applied. RESULTS: Plasma MR-proADM levels were found significantly higher in patients with unfavourable (mRS 3-6) compared to favourable (mRS 0-2) outcomes. MR-proADM levels were entered into a predictive model including the patients' age, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), and the use of recanalization therapy. The area under the ROC curve did not increase significantly. However, category-free NRI of 0.577 (p<0.001) indicated a significant improvement in reclassification of patients. Furthermore, MR-proADM levels significantly improved reclassification of patients in the prediction of outcome by the Stroke Prognostication using Age and NIHSS-100 (SPAN-100; NRI = 0.175; p = 0.04). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed a rising risk of death with increasing MR-proADM quintiles. CONCLUSIONS: Plasma MR-proADM levels improve prediction of functional outcome in ischemic stroke when added to the patients' age, NIHSS on admission, and the use of recanalization therapy. Levels of MR-proADM in peripheral blood improve reclassification of patients when the SPAN-100 is used to predict the patients' functional outcome."

The Forkhead box O (FoxO) transcription factor FOXO1 is an important tumor suppressor involved in apoptosis, the cell cycle, DNA damage repair and oxidative stress. Bioinformatic prediction identified that the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of FOXO1 is enriched with binding motifs for the human ELAV/Hu protein (HuR), indicating that FOXO1 is a potential target of HuR. Luciferase reporter assays demonstrate that HuR specifically regulates FOXO1 expression through AU-rich elements (AREs) within the FOXO1 3' UTR. Immunoprecipitation studies confirmed that HuR associates with FOXO1 mRNA in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and that HuR upregulates FOXO1 mRNA levels through increased mRNA stability. Using a HuR loss- and gain-of-function approach, we revealed that FOXO1 expression was correspondingly decreased or increased in MDA-MB-231 cells. Functional assays demonstrated that HuR and FOXO1 expression levels were markedly enhanced upon 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) stimulation in MDA-MB-231 cells. Knockdown of HuR apparently abrogated 5-FU-induced apoptosis detected by caspase-3 activities. Furthermore, in HuR knockdown cells, additional overexpression of FOXO1 moderately recovered 5-FU-induced apoptosis, which verified that HuR-modulated apoptosis upon 5-FU treatment was partially mediated by its post-transcriptional regulation of FOXO1. Therefore, modulating FOXO1 expression has been suggested to lead to the development of new therapeutic treatments for certain types of cancer."

C/EBPa-induced pre-B cell-to-macrophage transdifferentiation provides an excellent model to investigate the contribution of miRNAs to hematopoietic cell identity, especially because the two cell types involved fall into separate lymphoid and myeloid branches. In this process, efficient repression of the B cell-specific program is essential to ensure transdifferentation and macrophage function. miRNA profiling revealed that upregulation of miRNAs is highly predominant compared with downregulation and that C/EBPa directly regulates several upregulated miRNAs. We also determined that miRNA 34a (miR-34a) and miR-223 sharply accelerate C/EBPa-mediated transdifferentiation, whereas their depletion delays this process. These two miRNAs affect the transdifferentiation efficiency and activity of macrophages, including their lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-dependent inflammatory response. miR-34a and miR-223 directly target and downregulate the lymphoid transcription factor Lef1, whose ectopic expression delays transdifferentiation to an extent similar to that seen with miR-34a and miR-223 depletion. In addition, ectopic introduction of Lef1 in macrophages causes upregulation of B cell markers, including CD19, Pax5, and Ikzf3. Our report demonstrates the importance of these miRNAs in ensuring the erasure of key B cell transcription factors, such as Lef1, and reinforces the notion of their essential role in fine-tuning the control required for establishing cell identity.

Our objective was to evaluate everolimus, an mTOR inhibitor, in the treatment of angiomyolipoma in patients with subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) associated with TSC. METHODS: EXamining everolimus In a Study of Tuberous Sclerosis Complex-1 (NCT00789828), a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 study, examined everolimus in treating SEGA associated with TSC. Patients with serial SEGA growth from pre-baseline to baseline scans were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive 4.5 mg/m(2)/day everolimus (target blood trough: 5-15 ng/mL; n = 78) or placebo (n = 39). Angiomyolipoma response rates were analysed in patients (n = 44) with target baseline angiomyolipoma lesions (>=1 angiomyolipoma; longest diameter >=1.0 cm). An angiomyolipoma response rate, defined as the proportion of patients with confirmed angiomyolipoma response, was assessed by kidney CT or MRI screening at baseline, at 12, 24 and 48 weeks and annually. RESULTS: Angiomyolipoma response rates were 53.3% (16/30) and 0% (0/14) for everolimus- and placebo-treated patients, respectively. Angiomyolipoma reductions >=50% in the sum of volumes of all target lesions were seen only in everolimus-treated patients (56.5, 78.3 and 80.0%) compared with placebo-treated patients (0% at each time point) at Weeks 12, 24 and 48, respectively.

Prolactinomas are the most common type of functional pituitary tumor. Effective hyperprolactinemia treatment is of great importance, due to its potential deleterious effects including infertility, gonadal dysfunction and osteoporosis. Dopamine agonist therapy is the first line of treatment for prolactinomas because of its effectiveness in normalizing serum prolactin levels and shrinking tumor size. Though withdrawal of dopamine agonist treatment is safe and may be implemented following certain recommendations, recurrence of disease after cessation of the drug occurs in a substantial proportion of patients. Concerns regarding the safety of dopamine agonists have been raised, but its safety profile remains high, allowing its use during pregnancy. Surgery is typically indicated for patients who are resistant to medical therapy or intolerant of its adverse side effects, or are experiencing progressive tumor growth. Surgical resection can also be considered as a primary treatment for those with smaller focal tumors where a biochemical cure can be expected as an alternative to lifelong dopamine agonist treatment. Stereotactic radiosurgery also serves as an option for those refractory to medical and surgical therapy. "

The association between statin use and glycemic control in type 1 diabetes (T1DM) is unknown. The association between use of statins and glycemic control in T1DM patients without known heart disease was examined. METHODS: Cross-sectional study of 1093 T1DM patients from the outpatient clinic at Steno Diabetes Center. Physical examination, questionnaires, and echocardiography were performed in all patients. Investigators were blinded to all laboratory measurements. Data were analyzed in uni-and multivariable models. RESULTS: Mean age 49.6 years, 53% men, mean diabetes duration 25.5 years, 475 (43.5%) received statins. In baseline analyses statin users tended to be older, have longer diabetes duration, and have more severe kidney disease. Left ventricular ejection fraction was not associated with statin use. In multivariable models including age, gender, diabetes duration, BMI, blood pressure, physical activity, family history of cardiovascular disease, physical activity, albuminuria, eGFR, retinopathy, smoking, cholesterol, ejection fraction, triglycerides, and use of ACE/ATII-antagonists, aspirin, calcium-antagonists, betablockers or diuretics, statin use was independently and significantly associated with higher HbA1c (0.2% (95%CI: 0.1; 0.4) (2.0 mmol/mol (0.2; 3.8)), p=0.029). CONCLUSIONS: In T1DM, use of statins is independently associated with impaired glycemic control. A causal relationship cannot be determined from this study. Given the benefit on cardiovascular outcome, this should not cause patients to stop statin treatment, but may indicate a need to revisit dose of insulin when starting statin treatment."

        "text": "Molecular Identification of Mucor and Lichtheimia Species in Pure Cultures of Zygomycetes.\nBACKGROUND: The Mucorales are an important opportunistic fungi that can cause mucormycosis in immunocompromised patients. The fast and precise diagnosis of mucormycosis is very important because, if the diagnosis is not made early enough, dissemination often occurs. It is now well established that molecular methods such as polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) are feasible and reliable tools for the early and accurate diagnosis of mucormycosis agents. OBJECTIVES: The present study was conducted to evaluate the validity of PCR-RFLP for the identification of Mucorales and some important Mucor and Lichtheimia species in pure cultures of Zygomycetes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Specific sense and anti-sense primers were used to amplify the Mucorales, Mucor, and Lichtheimia DNA. The PCR products were digested by AfIII, XmnI, and AcII restriction enzymes, and the resultant restriction pattern was analyzed. RESULTS: On the basis of the molecular and morphological data, we identified Mucor plumbeus (10.83%), M. circinelloides (9.17%), Lichtheimia corymbifera (9.17%), M. racemosus (5.83%), M. ramosissimus (3.33%), and L. blakesleeana (0.83%). CONCLUSIONS: It seems that PCR-RFLP is a suitable technique for the identification of Mucorales at the species level."

The study populations was drawn from 22 normozoospermic healthy volunteers which were incubated with or without AMPK activator (resveratrol [RSV], 15 microM) or inhibitor (Compound C [CC], 30 microM) for 1 h and were then cryopreserved. Untreated frozen-thawed spermatozoa served as controls. The RSV-induced AMPK activation decreased the level of DNA fragmentation in comparison with the control (21.18 +- 0.92 vs. 22.50 +- 0.40; p < 0.01). The relative mRNA expression levels of protamines (1 and 2) and ADD1 in RSV pretreated frozen-thawed human spermatozoa were also improved significantly compared to the control (p < 0.05). Conversely, the inhibitory effect of CC on AMPK activity deteriorated the deleterious effects of cryopreservation on these parameters (p < 0.01). In conclusion, these results demonstrated the cryoprotective effect of the RSV-induced increase in AMPK activity on DNA integrity and key paternal transcripts of cryopreserved human spermatozoa. These findings are of great importance for improving the available cryopreservation protocols in terms of the number of lesions that produced over key genes and the dramatic effects on sperm DNA fragmentation."

Epigenetic changes are potential regulators of gene expression without involving any change in the DNA itself. More interestingly, epigenetic changes are reversible heritable changes which pass through generations. Many dietary bioactive ingredients regulate epigenetic control of cells and influence biochemical processes. Correlation between epigenetic regulation and cancer onset has been well established. Recent studies provide important information on the role of bioactive dietary components in cancer prevention and therapy. Several bioactive components are responsible for modification of the epigenome by affecting DNA methylation, histone modification, micro RNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). This review summarizes recent advancements in this field and describes the role of many bioactive components in regulating human epigenome and how these modifications can be exploited for prevention and treatment of cancer."

It has a major clinical impact as affected individuals are prone to syncope and sudden arrhythmogenic cardiac death. The LQTS comprises three groups of patients. The Jervell-Lange-Nielsen syndrome is characterized by an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance and congenital neural deafness. The Romano-Ward syndrome shows an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance and normal hearing. Patients with the sporadic form of LQTS have no evidence of familial transmission and have normal hearing. Imbalance of sympathetic cardiac innervation with predominance of the left stellate ganglion and an intrinsic myocardial defect leading to early afterdepolarization are the two pathogenetic mechanisms of LQTS discussed today. More recently a genetic basis for the Romano-Ward LQTS has been reported. The genetic linkage to the Harvey ras-1 gene provides the basis for a new hypothesis that an impairment of guanine nucleotide binding proteins is responsible for symptoms observed in LQTS. This paper discusses the genetic basis, pathology and pathophysiology of LQTS and tries to unify the different theories."

Jablonka and Lamb (1991, 1995) proposed that these systems have a substantial role during speciation. They argued that divergence of isolated populations may be first triggered by the accumulation of (heritable) phenotypic differences that are later followed and strengthened by genetic changes. The plausibility of this idea is examined in this paper. At first, we discuss the \"exploratory\" behaviour of an epigenetic inheritance system on a one peak adaptive landscape. If a quantitative trait is far from the optimum, then it is advantageous to induce heritable phenotypic variation. Conversely, if the genotypes get closer to the peak, it is more favorable to canalize the phenotypic expression of the character. This process would lead to genetic assimilation. Next we show that the divergence of heritable epigenetic marks acts to reduce or to eliminate the genetic barrier between two adaptive peaks. Therefore, an epigenetic inheritance system can increase the probability of transition from one adaptive state to another. Peak shift might be initiated by (i) slight changes in the inducing environment or by (ii) genetic drift of the genes controlling epigenetic variability. Remarkably, drift-induced transition is facilitated even if phenotypic variation is not heritable. A corollary of our thesis is that evolution can proceed through suboptimal phenotypic states, without passing through a deep adaptive valley of the genotype. We also consider the consequences of this finding on the dynamics and mode of reproductive isolation."

Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) controls melanocyte survival and differentiation. Mutations, which impair MITF function or expression, result in an abnormal melanocyte development leading to the WS2. WS1 and WS3 are caused by mutation in the gene encoding the transcription factor Pax3, which regulates MITF expression. Recently, mutations in SOX10, a gene encoding a SRY-related transcription factor, have been reported in patients with WS4. However, the molecular basis of the defective melanocyte development in these patients remained to be elucidated. In the present report, we demonstrate that Sox10 is a strong activator of the MITF promoter, and we identify a Sox10 binding site between -264 and -266 of the MITF promoter. Finally, we show that three SOX10 mutations found in WS4 abolish the transcriptional activity of the resulting Sox10 proteins toward the MITF promoter. Taken together, our observations bring new and meaningful information concerning the molecular process that leads to a defective melanocyte development in WS4 patients with SOX10 mutations."

Further, we found that the loss of synaptic proteins was more severe in the frontal cortex brain specimens than in the parietal cortex brain specimens from the AD subjects compared to those from the control subjects, suggesting that the frontal brain may be critical for synaptic function in AD. Using immunohistochemistry techniques, we also determined the distribution pattern of all synaptic proteins in both the frontal and parietal cortices brain specimens from control subjects. Of the 7 synaptic proteins studied, the presynaptic proteins synaptophysin and rab 3A and the postsynaptic protein synaptopodin were the most down-regulated. Our study suggests that postsynaptic proteins and presynaptic proteins are important for synaptic function and may be related to cognitive impairments in AD."

Using a novel blood assay that estimates CNS transporter occupancy we estimated the relative SERT and NET occupancy of paroxetine and venlafaxine in human subjects to assess the relative magnitude of SERT and NET inhibition. Outpatient subjects (N=86) meeting criteria for major depression were enrolled in a multicenter, 8 week, randomized, double-blind, parallel group, antidepressant treatment study. Subjects were treated by forced-titration of paroxetine CR (12.5-75 mg/day) or venlafaxine XR (75-375 mg/day) over 8 weeks. Blood samples were collected weekly to estimate transporter inhibition. Both medications produced dose-dependent inhibition of the SERT and NET. Maximal SERT inhibition at week 8 for paroxetine and venlafaxine was 90% (SD 7) and 85% (SD 10), respectively. Maximal NET inhibition for paroxetine and venlafaxine at week 8 was 36% (SD 19) and 60% (SD 13), respectively.

One of the citrullinating enzymes, peptidyl arginine deiminase type 4 (PAD-4), is genetically associated with development of RA in some populations, although the mechanism(s) mediating this effect are not yet clear. There have been descriptions of anti-PAD-4 autoantibodies in different rheumatic diseases. This study was undertaken to investigate whether anti-PAD-4 antibodies are specific to RA, are associated with disease phenotype or severity, and whether PAD-4 polymorphisms influence the anti-PAD-4 autoantibody response. METHODS: Sera from patients with established RA, patients with other rheumatic diseases, and healthy adults were assayed for anti-PAD-4 autoantibodies by immunoprecipitation of in vitro-translated PAD-4. The epitope(s) recognized by PAD-4 autoantibodies were mapped using various PAD-4 truncations. PAD-4 genotyping was performed on RA patients with the TaqMan assay. Joint erosions were scored from hand and foot radiographs using the Sharp/van der Heijde method. RESULTS: PAD-4 autoantibodies were found in 36-42% of RA patients, and were very infrequent in controls. Recognition by anti-PAD-4 autoantibodies required the 119 N-terminal amino acids, which encompass the 3 nonsynonymous polymorphisms associated with disease susceptibility. Strikingly, the anti-PAD-4 immune response was associated with the RA susceptibility haplotype of PADI4. Anti-PAD-4 antibodies were associated with more severe joint destruction in RA. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that anti-PAD-4 antibodies are specific markers of RA, independently associated with more severe disease, suggesting that an anti-PAD-4 immune response may be involved in pathways of joint damage in this disease. Polymorphisms in the PADI4 gene influence the immune response to the PAD-4 protein, potentially contributing to disease propagation."

        "text": "Oncogenic BRAF regulates melanoma proliferation through the lineage specific factor MITF.\nThe Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) is an important regulator of cell-type specific functions in melanocytic cells. MITF is essential for the survival of pigmented cells, but whereas high levels of MITF drive melanocyte differentiation, lower levels are required to permit proliferation and survival of melanoma cells. MITF is phosphorylated by ERK, and this stimulates its activation, but also targets it for degradation through the ubiquitin-proteosome pathway, coupling MITF degradation to its activation. We have previously shown that because ERK is hyper-activated in melanoma cells in which BRAF is mutated, the MITF protein is constitutively down-regulated. Here we describe another intriguing aspect of MITF regulation by oncogenic BRAF in melanoma cells. We show oncogenic BRAF up-regulates MITF transcription through ERK and the transcription factor BRN2 (N-Oct3). In contrast, we show that in melanocytes this pathway does not exist because BRN2 is not expressed, demonstrating that MITF regulation is a newly acquired function of oncogenic BRAF that is not performed by the wild-type protein. Critically, in melanoma cells MITF is required downstream of oncogenic BRAF because it regulates expression of key cell cycle regulatory proteins such as CDK2 and CDK4. Wild-type BRAF does not regulate this pathway in melanocytes. Thus, we show that oncogenic BRAF exerts exquisite control over MITF on two levels. It downregulates the protein by stimulating its degradation, but then counteracts this by increasing transcription through BRN2. Our data suggest that oncogenic BRAF plays a critical role in regulating MITF expression to ensure that its protein levels are compatible with proliferation and survival of melanoma cells. We propose that its ability to appropriate the regulation of this critical factor explains in part why BRAF is such a potent oncogene in melanoma."

Matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) promotes tumor invasion and progression by destroying the extracellular matrix (ECM) and basement membrane. For this proteolytic activity, the endogenous inhibitor is reversion-inducing cysteine rich protein with Kazal motifs (RECK). The aim of this study was to characterize the relationship between RECK and MMP-2 expression and the clinical manifestation of ameloblastoma. METHODS: Immunohistochemistry and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were employed to detect the protein and mRNA expression of RECK and MMP-2 in keratocystic odontogenic tumor (KCOT), ameloblastoma and ameloblastic carcinoma. RESULTS: RECK protein expression was significantly reduced in KCOT (87.5%), ameloblastoma (56.5%) and ameloblastic carcinoma (0%) (P < 0.01), and was significantly lower in recurrent ameloblastoma compared with primary ameloblastoma (P < 0.01), but did not differ by histological type of ameloblastoma. MMP-2 protein expression was significantly higher in ameloblastoma and ameloblastic carcinoma compared with KCOT (P < 0.01). RECK mRNA expression was significantly lower in ameloblastoma than in KCOT (P < 0.01), lower in recurrent ameloblastoma than in primary ameloblastoma, and was negative in ameloblastic carcinoma. MMP-2 mRNA expression was significantly higher in ameloblastoma compared with KCOT (P < 0.01), but was no different in recurrent ameloblastoma versus primary ameloblastoma. RECK protein expression was negatively associated with MMP-2 protein expression in ameloblastoma (r = -0.431, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Low or no RECK expression and increased MMP-2 expression may be associated with negative clinical findings in ameloblastoma. RECK may participate in the invasion, recurrence and malignant transformation of ameloblastoma by regulating MMP-2 at the post-transcriptional level."

To determine whether this suppression is essential for PTH-mediated Wnt signaling and bone formation, we examined mice that overexpress Dkk1 in osteoblasts (Dkk1 mice). Dkk1 mice were osteopenic due to abnormal osteoblast and osteoclast activity. When fed a low-calcium diet, and in two other models of hyperparathyroidism, these mice failed to develop the peritrabecular stromal cell response (\"osteitis fibrosis\") and new bone formation seen in wild-type mice. Despite these effects of Dkk1 overexpression, PTH still activated Wnt signaling in Dkk1 mice and in osteoblastic cells cultured from these mice. In cultured MC3T3E1 preosteoblastic cells, PTH dramatically suppressed Dkk1 expression, induced PKA-mediated phosphorylation of beta-catenin, and significantly enhanced Lef1 expression. Our findings indicate that the full actions of PTH require intact Wnt signaling but that PTH can activate the Wnt pathway despite overexpression of Dkk1."

However, in the beginning of 1990s it was shown very antiangiogenic. Its immunological effects were known already from earlier studies. Nowadays its use is accepted in myeloma therapy. It is also used in many study protocols, e.g. in pediatric patients with brainstem tumors. Thalidomide should be used very cautiously for fertile patients because of its teratogenity.

We identified an interaction between sclerostin and the carboxyl-terminal portion of the receptor tyrosine-protein kinase erbB-3. To determine the biological relevance of this interaction, we treated MC3T3-E1 mouse osteoblast cells transfected with either a SOST expression plasmid or a control vector, with recombinant heregulin/neuregulin. Phospho-p44/42 (Thr202/Tyr204) MAPK was assessed in heregulin/neuregulin treated cells. We observed an increase in phospho-p44/42 (Thr202/Tyr204) MAPK concentrations in SOST transfected cells but not in cells transfected with a control vector, thus demonstrating a modulatory effect of sclerostin on heregulin/neuregulin signaling in osteoblasts. The data demonstrate that sclerostin functions in part, by modulating the activity of erbB-3."

In our opinion, the multifunctional Ca and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) has emerged as a molecule to watch, in part because a solid body of accumulated data essentially satisfy Koch's postulates, showing that the CaMKII pathway is a core mechanism for promoting myocardial hypertrophy and heart failure. Multiple groups have now confirmed the following: (1) that CaMKII activity is increased in hypertrophied and failing myocardium from animal models and patients; (2) CaMKII overexpression causes myocardial hypertrophy and HF and (3) CaMKII inhibition (by drugs, inhibitory peptides and gene deletion) improves myocardial hypertrophy and HF. Patients with myocardial disease die in equal proportion from HF and arrhythmias, and a major therapeutic obstacle is that drugs designed to enhance myocardial contraction promote arrhythmias. In contrast, inhibiting the CaMKII pathway appears to reduce arrhythmias and improve myocardial responses to pathological stimuli. This brief paper will introduce the molecular physiology of CaMKII and discuss the impact of CaMKII on ion channels, Ca handling proteins and transcription in myocardium.

        "text": "Detection of apoptosis in ovarian cells in vitro and in vivo using the annexin v-affinity assay.\nThe ability of a cell to undergo apoptosis is crucial during development, tissue homeostasis, and in the pathogenesis and treatment of disease (1). To study apoptosis, it is important to be able to detect apoptotic cells reliably. Here we describe a method to detect apoptosis in vitro and in vivo on basis of the changes in phospholipid distribution in the plasma membrane that occur during this process. In healthy cells, phosphatidylserine (PS) is maintained predominantly in the inner plasma membrane surface by an aminophospholipid translocase (2). However, early during apoptosis, PS is translocated from the inner to the outer membrane surface and serves as a trigger for adjacent phagocytes to remove the dying cell (3-5). Exposure of PS can be detected in vitro and in vivo with fluorochrome- or biotin-labeled annexin V, a protein that binds to negatively charged phospholipids in the presence of calcium ions (6,7). In cells that are cultured in suspension, detection of apoptosis on the basis of PS exposure is relatively easy (8). However, sample handling of adherent cell lines, such as the ovarian cell line PA-1, might interfere with reliable detection of PS exposure. Therefore, we developed a method to detect PS exposure in adherent cell lines by labeling cells in a monolayer with annexin V and harvesting the cells afterwards by mechanical scraping (9) (Figs. 1 and 2). Fixation of annexin V-labeled cells also allows the study of the relationship between PS exposure and expression of intracellular antigens (10). We also present a method to detect apoptosis in vivo during follicular maturation in the mouse Fig. 3). This method is based on in vivo studies of viable mouse embryos, which indicate that PS exposure is a pancellular phenomenon of apoptosis during mammalian development (11,12). Fig. 1. Confocal scanning laser microscopy analysis of PA-1 ovary teratocarcinoma cells. Apoptosis was induced by treating the cells for 6 h with 50 muM roscovitine, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor. Cells were labeled with annexin V-Oregon green to detect PS exposure, harvested by mechanical scraping, and labeled with propidium iodide (PI) to detect plasma membrane integrity. A and B show a linear projection of a stack of confocal images of early apoptotic cells after labeling with annexin V. At this stage, the plasma membrane integrity is preserved and, therefore, PI cannot enter the cell. C shows a secondary necrotic PA-1 cell, with clear annexin V staining at the plasma membrane (C1) and with PI staining of the condensed and fragmented chromatin (C2). Fig. 2. Dotplot of bivariate PI/annexin V flow cytometric analysis of adherent ovary cell line PA-1. Plasma membrane integrity is shown on the X-axis and annexin V immunofluorescence is shown on the Y-axis. Cells were treated with 50 muM roscovitine to induce apoptosis. 6 h after roscovitine treatment, cells were labeled with annexin V-Oregon green, harvested by scraping, and labeled with PI. Four populations of cells can be identified: region R1: vital cells (annexin V negative/PI negative), region R2: apoptotic cells (annexin V positive/PI negative), region R3: dead cells (annexin V positive/ PI positive); and region R4: damaged cells (annexin V negative/PI positive). For technical details, see ref. 9. Fig. 3. Micrographs of paraffin sections through mice ovaries that were perfused with biotinylated annexin V (A-F) or HEPES-buffer only (G and H). In A, annexin V labeled early apoptotic cells (arrowhead) and late apoptotic-pyknotic (arrow) granulosa cells are shown. During follicle maturation, initially apoptosis is absent (B). At later phases, annexin V labeled apoptotic granulosa cells (C, arrow) were observed in the primary (C) and secondary (D) follicles.

Labeled apoptotic and postapoptotic necrotic cells that have been shed into the antrum are clearly visible (asterisk), as well as unlabeled late postapoptotic necrotic cells.

However, cellular stimuli enable p53 to escape from the negative regulation, and then stably expressed p53 transactivates its target genes to induce cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, or apoptosis. Promoter preference of target genes is determined by modification status of p53. Because p53 has two critical roles in the decision of cell fate, stopping cell cycle to repair damaged DNA or induction of apoptotic cell death in response to DNA damage, elucidation of switching mechanisms on p53 functions is of particular importance. Here we review recent evidence how several post-translational modifications of p53 including methylation, phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination, affect the functions of p53 in response to cellular stress."

During the last decade, curcumin (diferuloylmethane), a natural compound from the root of turmeric (Curcuma longa), was described as a potent chemopreventive agent. Curcumin exhibits anti-inflammatory, anticarcinogenic, antiproliferative, antiangiogenic, and antioxidant properties in various cancer cell models. This study was designed to identify proteins involved in the anticancer activity of curcumin in androgen-dependent (22Rv1) and -independent (PC-3) human prostate cancer cell lines using two-dimensional difference in gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE). Out of 425 differentially expressed spots, we describe here the MALDI-TOF-MS analysis of 192 spots of interest, selected by their expression profile. This approach allowed the identification of 60 differentially expressed proteins (32 in 22Rv1 cells and 47 in PC-3 cells). Nineteen proteins are regulated in both cell lines. Further bioinformatic analysis shows that proteins modulated by curcumin are implicated in protein folding (such as heat-shock protein PPP2R1A; RNA splicing proteins RBM17, DDX39; cell death proteins HMGB1 and NPM1; proteins involved in androgen receptor signaling, NPM1 and FKBP4/FKBP52), and that this compound could have an impact on miR-141, miR-152, and miR-183 expression. Taken together, these data support the hypothesis that curcumin is an interesting chemopreventive agent as it modulates the expression of proteins that potentially contribute to prostate carcinogenesis."

Foodborne botulism is a rare and sometimes fatal illness caused by consuming foods containing botulinum neurotoxin. METHODS: Investigators reviewed patients' medical charts and food histories. Clinical specimens and food samples were tested for botulinum toxin and neurotoxin-producing Clostridium species. Investigators conducted inspections of the cannery that produced the implicated product. RESULTS: Eight confirmed outbreak associated cases were identified from Indiana (n = 2), Texas (n = 3), and Ohio (n = 3). Botulinum toxin type A was identified in leftover chili sauce consumed by the Indiana patients and 1 of the Ohio patients. Cannery inspectors found violations of federal canned-food regulations that could have led to survival of Clostridium botulinum spores during sterilization. The company recalled 39 million cans of chili. Following the outbreak, the US Food and Drug Administration inspected other canneries with similar canning systems and issued warnings to the industry about the danger of C. botulinum and the importance of compliance with canned food manufacturing regulations. CONCLUSIONS: Commercially produced hot dog chili sauce caused these cases of type A botulism. This is the first US foodborne botulism outbreak involving a commercial cannery in >30 years. Sharing of epidemiologic and laboratory findings allowed for the rapid identification of implicated food items and swift removal of potentially deadly products from the market by US food regulatory authorities."

In addition, there was a strong trend for a reduction in the rate of stroke/systemic embolism with rivaroxaban compared with warfarin. METHODS: In this subanalysis of the J-ROCKET AF trial, we investigated the consistency of safety and efficacy profile of rivaroxaban versus warfarin among the subgroups of patients with previous stroke, transient ischemic attack, or non-central nervous system systemic embolism (secondary prevention group) and those without (primary prevention group). RESULTS: Patients in the secondary prevention group were 63.6% of the overall population of J-ROCKET AF. In the secondary prevention group, the rate of the principal safety outcome (% per year) was 17.02 in rivaroxaban-treated patients and 18.26 in warfarin-treated patients (hazard ratio [HR] 0.95; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.70-1.29), while the rate of the primary efficacy endpoint was 1.66 in rivaroxaban-treated patients and 3.25 in warfarin-treated patients (HR 0.51; 95% CI 0.23-1.14). There were no significant interactions in the principal safety and the primary efficacy endpoints of rivaroxaban compared to warfarin between the primary and secondary prevention groups (P=.090 and .776 for both interactions, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The safety and efficacy profile of rivaroxaban compared with warfarin was consistent among patients in the primary prevention group and those in the secondary prevention group."

To identify additional driver mutations in HGGs, we investigated a cohort of 60 pediatric HGGs using whole-exome sequencing (WES) and compared them to 543 exomes from non-cancer control samples. We identified mutations in SETD2, a H3K36 trimethyltransferase, in 15% of pediatric HGGs, a result that was genome-wide significant (FDR = 0.029). Most SETD2 alterations were truncating mutations. Sequencing the gene in this cohort and another validation cohort (123 gliomas from all ages and grades) showed SETD2 mutations to be specific to high-grade tumors affecting 15% of pediatric HGGs (11/73) and 8% of adult HGGs (5/65) while no SETD2 mutations were identified in low-grade diffuse gliomas (0/45). Furthermore, SETD2 mutations were mutually exclusive with H3F3A mutations in HGGs (P = 0.0492) while they partly overlapped with IDH1 mutations (4/14), and SETD2-mutant tumors were found exclusively in the cerebral hemispheres (P = 0.0055). SETD2 is the only H3K36 trimethyltransferase in humans, and SETD2-mutant tumors showed a substantial decrease in H3K36me3 levels (P < 0.001), indicating that the mutations are loss-of-function. These data suggest that loss-of-function SETD2 mutations occur in older children and young adults and are specific to HGG of the cerebral cortex, similar to the H3.3 G34R/V and IDH mutations. Taken together, our results suggest that mutations disrupting the histone code at H3K36, including H3.3 G34R/V, IDH1 and/or SETD2 mutations, are central to the genesis of hemispheric HGGs in older children and young adults."

MAP3K8 (TPL2/COT) is an important signal transductor and activator of pro-inflammatory pathways that has been linked to obesity-induced adipose tissue inflammation. We used human adipose tissue biopsies to study the relationship of MAP3K8 expression with markers of obesity and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-6 and IL-8). Moreover, we evaluated obesity-induced adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance in mice lacking MAP3K8 and WT mice on a high-fat diet (HFD) for 16 weeks. Individuals with a BMI >30 displayed a higher mRNA expression of MAP3K8 in adipose tissue compared to individuals with a normal BMI. Additionally, high mRNA expression levels of IL-1beta, IL-6 and IL-8, but not TNF -alpha, in human adipose tissue were associated with higher expression of MAP3K8. Moreover, high plasma SAA and CRP did not associate with increased MAP3K8 expression in adipose tissue. Similarly, no association was found for MAP3K8 expression with plasma insulin or glucose levels. Mice lacking MAP3K8 had similar bodyweight gain as WT mice, yet displayed lower mRNA expression levels of IL-1beta, IL-6 and CXCL1 in adipose tissue in response to the HFD as compared to WT animals. However, MAP3K8 deficient mice were not protected against HFD-induced adipose tissue macrophage infiltration or the development of insulin resistance.

The mechanisms of mitochondrial metabolic and redox regulation for efficient cardiomyocyte differentiation are, however, still poorly understood. Here, we show that inhibition of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) by Cyclosporin A (CsA) promotes cardiomyocyte differentiation from PSCs. METHODS AND RESULTS: We induced cardiomyocyte differentiation from mouse and human PSCs and examined the effect of CsA on the differentiation process. The cardiomyogenic effect of CsA mainly resulted from mPTP inhibition rather than from calcineurin inhibition. The mPTP inhibitor NIM811, which does not have an inhibitory effect on calcineurin, promoted cardiomyocyte differentiation as much as CsA did, but calcineurin inhibitor FK506 only slightly increased cardiomyocyte differentiation. CsA-treated cells showed an increase in mitochondrial calcium, mitochondrial membrane potential, oxygen consumption rate, ATP level, and expression of genes related to mitochondrial function. Furthermore, inhibition of mitochondrial oxidative metabolism reduced the cardiomyogenic effect of CsA while antioxidant treatment augmented the cardiomyogenic effect of CsA. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that mPTP inhibition by CsA alters mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and redox signaling, which leads to differentiation of functional cardiomyocytes from PSCs."

This presentation has been associated with heterozygous mutations in CCM1/KRIT1, CCM2/malcavernin and CCM3/PDCD10. We aimed to investigate the genetic defect underlying multiple cerebral and vertebral cavernous malformations in a multigenerational Italian family. CASE PRESENTATION: The proband is a 49-year-old man who underwent cerebral MRI in his thirties for persistent haeadache and tingling in his left arm and leg and was diagnosed with multiple supratentorial cavernous angiomas. A right frontal angioma with radiological evidence of a recent bleeding was surgically removed when he was 39 years old and he was thereafter asymptomatic. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed multiple cerebral cavernous malformations in seven members of his familily. Four subjects were asymptomatic. Other family mambers displayed heterogeneous clinical features including seizures and recurrent brain haemorrhages. Sequence analysis in the proband disclosed a novel heterozygous nucleotide substitution (c.263-10A > G) in intron 5 of CCM1. This variant is predicted to create an abnormal acceptor splice site and segregated in affected relatives available for molecular screening. The analysis of CCM1 transcript in proband's lymphocytes confirmed the partial retention of intron 3 resulting in a premature termination codon. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that c.263-10A > G mutation is associated with cerebral cavernous malformations. A better knowledge of the disease-associated phenotype may lead to an early diagnosis and to an appropriate clinical surveillance in affected patients."

The FOXP2 protein is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of many downstream genes, which may have important roles in nervous system development and function. An adequate amount of functional FOXP2 protein is thought to be critical for the proper development of the neural circuitry underlying speech and language. However, how FOXP2 gene expression is regulated is not clearly understood. The FOXP2 mRNA has an approximately 4-kb-long 3' untranslated region (3' UTR), twice as long as its protein coding region, indicating that FOXP2 can be regulated by microRNAs (miRNAs). FINDINGS: We identified multiple miRNAs that regulate the expression of the human FOXP2 gene using sequence analysis and in vitro cell systems. Focusing on let-7a, miR-9, and miR-129-5p, three brain-enriched miRNAs, we show that these miRNAs regulate human FOXP2 expression in a dosage-dependent manner and target specific sequences in the FOXP2 3' UTR. We further show that these three miRNAs are expressed in the cerebellum of the human fetal brain, where FOXP2 is known to be expressed. CONCLUSIONS: Our results reveal novel regulatory functions of the human FOXP2 3' UTR sequence and regulatory interactions between multiple miRNAs and the human FOXP2 gene. The expression of let-7a, miR-9, and miR-129-5p in the human fetal cerebellum is consistent with their roles in regulating FOXP2 expression during early cerebellum development. These results suggest that various genetic and environmental factors may contribute to speech and language development and related neural developmental disorders via the miRNA-FOXP2 regulatory network."

Subsequent contrast-enhanced CT established the presence of intracranial empyema; the patient underwent immediate burr-hole evacuation of the pus and received 7 weeks of intravenous antibiotics, recovering with no residual neurological deficit. DISCUSSION: The diagnosis of subdural empyema as a complication of asymptomatic sinusitis in an immunocompetent patient with no history of fever or upper respiratory symptoms was unanticipated. Furthermore, the organism Streptococcus pluranimalium that was cultured from the pus has only been documented twice previously in medical literature to cause infection in humans, as it is primarily a pathogen responsible for infection in bovine and avian species. CONCLUSION: Subdural empyema represents a neurosurgical emergency and if left untreated is invariably fatal. Rapid diagnosis, surgical intervention and intensive antibiotic therapy improve both morbidity and mortality."

        "text": "Protoporphyrin IX induces a necrotic cell death in human THP-1 macrophages through activation of reactive oxygen species/c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase pathway and opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pore.\nBACKGROUND: Protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) and its derivatives are widely used in photodynamic therapy (PDT) to kill cancer cells. Studies showed that the application of these drugs could cause systemic toxic effects in human. However, the molecular pathways involved in PpIX-induced cytotoxicity are not well-defined. Macrophages represent the primary system for protecting tissues from toxicants and initiating the resolution of inflammation. Thus, this study aims to investigate the toxicity of PpIX on macrophages and provide strategies to prevent the toxic effects. METHODS: THP-1 macrophages were incubated with PpIX and cell death was measured by MTT assay and Annexin V-PI staining. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were evaluated by 2', 7'-Dichlorodihydrofluorescin diacetate (DCFH-DA) and MitoSOX  Red staining and mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim) was detected by tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM) staining. Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activation was assayed by western blotting. Mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening was measured by calcein loading/Co(2+) quenching technique and evaluating the release of mitochondrial content. RESULTS: PpIX reduced cell viability in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The cell death was characterized by increasing PI-positive cells, ATP depletion, LDH releasing and rapid DeltaPsim loss favoring necrotic features. In addition, PpIX successively induced ROS production, c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK) activation and mPTP opening. ROS scavengers, N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and deferoxamine (DFX), JNK inhibitor, SP600125, and mPTP inhibitor, cyclosporin A (CsA), all significantly rescued this cell death. Furthermore, mPTP opening was directly regulated by ROS/JNK pathway. CONCLUSION: PpIX induces a necrotic cell death in THP-1 macrophages through ROS production, JNK activation, and mPTP opening. It is tempting to speculate that blocking the pathways involved in the cytotoxic effects of PpIX will alleviate its side effects."

This novel siRNA based drug was studied, in combination with chemotherapy, as targeted therapy for Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer (LAPC). METHODS: An open-label Phase 1/2a study in the first-line setting of patients with non-operable LAPC was initiated. In this study patients were assigned to receive a single dose of siG12D-LODERs, in three escalating dose cohorts (0.025mg, 0.75mg and 3.0mg). Gemcitabine was given on a weekly basis, following the siG12D-LODERTM insertion, until disease progression. The recommended dose was further examined with modified FOLFIRINOX. The follow up period was eight weeks and survival until death. RESULTS: Fifteen patients with LAPC were enrolled. Among the 15 treated patients, the most frequent adverse events observed were grade 1or 2 in severity (89%); five patients experienced serious adverse events (SAEs). In 12 patients analyzed by CT scans, none showed tumor progression, the majority (10/12) demonstrated stable disease and two showed partial response. Decrease in tumor marker CA19-9 was observed in 70% (7/10) of patients. Median overall survival was 15.12 months; 18 month survival was 38.5%. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of siG12D-LODER  and chemotherapy is well tolerated, safe and demonstrated a potential efficacy in patients with LAPC. NCT01188785."

The clinical findings of the patient with constipation, bulbar weakness, and descending, symmetric motor weakness are consistent with the classic findings of infant botulism. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), however, revealed restricted diffusion in the brain and enhancement of the cervical nerve roots. Traditionally, normal neuroimaging was used to help differentiate infant botulism from other causes of weakness in infants. Abnormal neuroimaging is seen in other causes of weakness in an infant including metabolic disorders and hypoxic-ischemic injury, but these diagnoses did not fit the clinical findings in this case. The explanation for the MRI abnormalities in the brain and cervical nerve roots is unclear as botulinum toxin acts at presynaptic nerve terminals and does not cross the blood-brain barrier. Possible explanations for the findings include inflammation from the botulinum toxin at the synapse, alterations in sensory signaling and retrograde transport of the botulinum toxin. The patient was treated with human botulism immune globulin and had rapid recovery in weakness. A stool sample from the patient was positive for Type A Clostridium botulinum toxin eventually confirming the diagnosis of infant botulism. The findings in this case support use of human botulism immune globulin when the clinical findings are consistent with infant botulism despite the presence of MRI abnormalities in the brain and cervical nerve roots.

Conversion of B cells to macrophages was readily induced by the ectopic expression of any C/EBP, and enhanced by endogenous C/EBPalpha and beta activation. High transgene expression of C/EBPbeta or C/EBPepsilon, but not of C/EBPalpha or C/EBPdelta, also induced the formation of granulocytes. Granulocytes and macrophages emerged in a mutually exclusive manner. C/EBPbeta-expressing B cells produced granulocyte-macrophage progenitor (GMP)-like progenitors when subjected to selective pressure to eliminate lymphoid cells. The GMP-like progenitors remained self-renewing and cytokine-independent, and continuously produced macrophages and granulocytes. In addition to their suitability to study myelomonocytic lineage bifurcation, lineage-switched GMP-like progenitors could reflect the features of the lympho-myeloid lineage switch observed in leukemic progression."

Consequently, several drug delivery systems based on polymeric and lipid raw materials have been proposed to increase its bioavailability. Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN), consisting of solid lipid matrix and a surfactant layer can load poorly water-soluble drugs, such as curcumin, deliver them at defined rates and enhance their intracellular uptake. In the present work, we demonstrate that, despite the drug's affinity to lipids frequently used in SLN production, the curcumin amount loaded in most SLN formulations may be too low to exhibit anticancer properties. The predictive curcumin solubility in solid lipids has been thoroughly analyzed by Hansen solubility parameters, in parallel with the lipid-screening solubility tests for a range of selected lipids. We identified the most suitable lipid materials for curcumin-loaded SLN, producing physicochemically stable particles with high encapsulation efficiency (>90%). Loading capacity of curcumin in SLN allowed preventing the cellular damage caused by cationic SLN on MCF-7 and BT-474 cells but was not sufficient to exhibit drug's anticancer properties. But curcumin-loaded SLN exhibited antioxidant properties, substantiating the conclusions that curcumin's effect in cancer cells is highly dose dependent."

METHODS: We conducted a phase 2, single-cohort, 25-center, global study of tisagenlecleucel in pediatric and young adult patients with CD19+ relapsed or refractory B-cell ALL. The primary end point was the overall remission rate (the rate of complete remission or complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery) within 3 months. RESULTS: For this planned analysis, 75 patients received an infusion of tisagenlecleucel and could be evaluated for efficacy. The overall remission rate within 3 months was 81%, with all patients who had a response to treatment found to be negative for minimal residual disease, as assessed by means of flow cytometry. The rates of event-free survival and overall survival were 73% (95% confidence interval [CI], 60 to 82) and 90% (95% CI, 81 to 95), respectively, at 6 months and 50% (95% CI, 35 to 64) and 76% (95% CI, 63 to 86) at 12 months. The median duration of remission was not reached. Persistence of tisagenlecleucel in the blood was observed for as long as 20 months. Grade 3 or 4 adverse events that were suspected to be related to tisagenlecleucel occurred in 73% of patients. The cytokine release syndrome occurred in 77% of patients, 48% of whom received tocilizumab. Neurologic events occurred in 40% of patients and were managed with supportive care, and no cerebral edema was reported. CONCLUSIONS: In this global study of CAR T-cell therapy, a single infusion of tisagenlecleucel provided durable remission with long-term persistence in pediatric and young adult patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell ALL, with transient high-grade toxic effects.

There is an urgent need for developing cardio-oncological therapeutic interventions. Natural products having both anti-cancerous potential as well as cardioprotective effects may hold a great potential in this regard. Curcuma longa (an Indian herb) polyphenols including curcumin, and well known for its anti-oxidative and anti-cancerous potential was used in the present study for its synergistic effect on cancer cells and cardiomyocytes. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Preliminary dose dependent analysis for cell viability was conducted by MTT and trypan blue assays where the effects of curcumin and Dox on cancer cell progression and cardiotoxicity were studied. Microscopic studies were done to analyse the morphological alterations of cells followed by intracellular ROS production studies by NBT and DCFH-DA assays. Apoptotic cellular death was studied by caspase activity and Annexin/PI FACS analysis. TUNEL assay was done followed by expression analysis of different cellular death biomarkers by quantitative real-time PCR. KEY FINDINGS: We observed that dose dependent cardiotoxicity of Dox can be significantly minimized by supplementing it with curcumin. Curcumin supplementation exaggerates oxidative stress and apoptosis leading to cancer cell death by modulating pro- and anti-apoptotic biomarkers. SIGNIFICANCE: The combination treatment with curcumin results in achieving the desired anti-cancerous effect of Dox without compromising its activity and hence, reduces the possibility of its dose mediated cardiotoxic effects. Hence, curcumin holds a great potential for cardio-oncological therapeutic interventions."

        "text": "The Emerging Threat of (Micro)Thrombosis in COVID-19 and Its Therapeutic Implications.\nThe recent emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the ensuing global pandemic has presented a health emergency of unprecedented magnitude. Recent clinical data has highlighted that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with a significant risk of thrombotic complications ranging from microvascular thrombosis, venous thromboembolic disease, and stroke. Importantly, thrombotic complications are markers of severe COVID-19 and are associated with multiorgan failure and increased mortality. The evidence to date supports the concept that the thrombotic manifestations of severe COVID-19 are due to the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to invade endothelial cells via ACE-2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2), which is expressed on the endothelial cell surface. However, in patients with COVID-19 the subsequent endothelial inflammation, complement activation, thrombin generation, platelet, and leukocyte recruitment, and the initiation of innate and adaptive immune responses culminate in immunothrombosis, ultimately causing (micro)thrombotic complications, such as deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and stroke. Accordingly, the activation of coagulation (eg, as measured with plasma D-dimer) and thrombocytopenia have emerged as prognostic markers in COVID-19. Given thrombotic complications are central determinants of the high mortality rate in COVID-19, strategies to prevent thrombosis are of critical importance. Several antithrombotic drugs have been proposed as potential therapies to prevent COVID-19-associated thrombosis, including heparin, FXII inhibitors, fibrinolytic drugs, nafamostat, and dipyridamole, many of which also possess pleiotropic anti-inflammatory or antiviral effects. The growing awareness and mechanistic understanding of the prothrombotic state of COVID-19 patients are driving efforts to more stringent diagnostic screening for thrombotic complications and to the early institution of antithrombotic drugs, for both the prevention and therapy of thrombotic complications. The shifting paradigm of diagnostic and treatment strategies holds significant promise to reduce the burden of thrombotic complications and ultimately improve the prognosis for patients with COVID-19."

RUNX1T1 is mediated by the fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO). However, the extent to which RUNX1T1 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are associated with obesity risk or metabolic abnormalities in a community population basis is unknown. METHODS: Samples were obtained from the Australian Crossroads study bio-bank. SNPs located in the coding region and 3'untranslated regions of RUNX1T1 with minor allele frequency >=0.05 were analysed using Taqman genotyping assays. RESULTS: Eight candidate SNPs were genotyped successfully in 1440 participants. Of these SNPs only rs34269950 located in the 'RRACH' motif, the most common N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylation modification site (recognized by FTO), was significantly associated with obesity risk and metabolic abnormalities. Specifically, compared to AA genotype, rs34269950 del/del genotype was associated with a 1.47 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01-2.14, P = 0.042] fold higher rate of obesity risk. Additionally, the del/del genotype was associated with a 60% increased risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS) [odds ratio (OR) = 1.60, 95% CI: 1.10-2.32, P = 0.015], in comparison to the AA genotype. Finally, rs34269950 del/del increased the risk of a larger waist circumference (OR = 1.65, 95% CI: 1.15-2.36, P = 0.007), but not other components of MetS. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that RUNX1T1 rs34269950, located in a potential FTO recognition motif, is significantly associated with waist circumference. This provides novel evidence to suggest SNPs located in RRACH motif may be involved in RNA m6A modification and mechanistic pathways that influence abdominal obesity."

To our knowledge, ticagrelor has not been evaluated in elective PCI and could reduce periprocedural ischaemic complications compared with clopidogrel, the currently recommended treatment. The aim of the ALPHEUS study was to examine if ticagrelor was superior to clopidogrel in reducing periprocedural myocardial necrosis in stable coronary patients undergoing high-risk elective PCI. METHODS: The ALPHEUS study, a phase 3b, randomised, open-label trial, was done at 49 hospitals in France and Czech Republic. Patients with stable coronary artery disease were eligible for the study if they had an indication for PCI and at least one high-risk characteristic. Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to either ticagrelor (180 mg loading dose, 90 mg twice daily thereafter for 30 days) or clopidogrel (300-600 mg loading dose, 75 mg daily thereafter for 30 days) by use of an interactive web response system, and stratified by centre. The primary outcome was a composite of PCI-related type 4 (a or b) myocardial infarction or major myocardial injury and the primary safety outcome was major bleeding, both of which were evaluated within 48 h of PCI (or at hospital discharge if earlier). The primary analysis was based on all events that occurred in the intention-to-treat population. The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02617290. FINDINGS: Between Jan 9, 2017, and May 28, 2020, 1910 patients were randomly assigned at 49 sites, 956 to the ticagrelor group and 954 to the clopidogrel group. 15 patients were excluded from the ticagrelor group and 12 from the clopidogrel group. At 48 h, the primary outcome was observed in 334 (35%) of 941 patients in the ticagrelor group and 341 (36%) of 942 patients in the clopidogrel group (odds ratio [OR] 0 97, 95% CI 0 80-1 17; p=0 75). The primary safety outcome did not differ between the two groups, but minor bleeding events were more frequently observed with ticagrelor than clopidogrel at 30 days (105 [11%] of 941 patients in the ticagrelor group vs 71 [8%] of 942 patients in the clopidogrel group; OR 1 54, 95% CI 1 12-2 11; p=0 0070). INTERPRETATION: Ticagrelor was not superior to clopidogrel in reducing periprocedural myocardial necrosis after elective PCI and did not cause an increase in major bleeding, but did increase the rate of minor bleeding at 30 days. These results support the use of clopidogrel as the standard of care for elective PCI. FUNDING: ACTION Study Group and AstraZeneca."

To identify status of repeat range in Indian SCA cases and provide extended family screening, we enrolled 70 clinical SCA suspects. For molecular diagnosis, multiplex PCR (M-PCR) was used for common Indian SCA subtypes 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 12 and 17. TP-PCR was further used in SCA2, 7 and 10 to identify larger expansions. Eighteen out of 70 SCA suspects (25%) were found to be positive for various SCA subtypes- (5 SCA1 (28%), 6 SAC2 (34%), 2 SCA3 (12%), 3 SCA7 (16%) and one each for SCA6 (1%) and SCA17 (1%) subtypes). Genetic counselling and extended family screening were offered to all positive cases and yielded additional nine cases. We have established M-PCR and TP-PCR to detect the CAG repeat expansion in SCA suspects. This method can confirm SCA subtypes in a reliable, rapid and cost-effective way. Genetic characterization of SCA-related genes has great clinical relevance, as it could provide additional information and guidance to clinicians and family members regarding prognosis."

METHODS: We analyzed the data from the Cerner deidentified COVID-19 data set derived from 62 health care facilities. The data set included patients with an emergency department or inpatient encounter with discharge diagnoses codes that could be associated with suspicion of or exposure to COVID-19 or confirmed COVID-19. RESULTS: There were a total of 154 (0.2%) and 667 (0.3%) patients with intracerebral hemorrhage among 85,645 patients with COVID-19 and 197,073 patients without COVID-19, respectively. In the multivariate model, there was a lower risk of intracerebral hemorrhage in patients with COVID-19 (odds ratio 0.5; 95% confidence interval 0.5-0.6; p < .0001) after adjustment for sex, age strata, race/ethnicity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, nicotine dependence/tobacco use, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, long-term anticoagulant use, and alcohol abuse. The proportions of patients who developed pneumonia (58.4% versus 22.5%; p < .0001), acute kidney injury (48.7% versus 31.0%; p < .0001), acute myocardial infarction (11% versus 6.4%; p = .048), sepsis (41.6% versus 22.5%; p < .0001), and respiratory failure (61.7% versus 42.3%; p < .0001) were significantly higher among patients with intracerebral hemorrhage and COVID-19 compared with those without COVID-19. The in-hospital mortality among patients with intracerebral hemorrhage and COVID-19 was significantly higher compared with that among those without COVID-19 (40.3% versus 19.0%; p < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis does not suggest that rates of intracerebral hemorrhage are higher in patients with COVID-19. The higher mortality in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage and COVID-19 compared with those without COVID-19 is likely mediated by higher frequency of comorbidities and adverse in-hospital events."

Currently, there is no consensual recommendation on a routinely monitored biomarker to early detect irAE. Biological markers such as serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) are commonly used to measure muscular tissue injury. The potential of routine serum CPK monitoring to predict cardiac or neuromuscular irAE in patients treated with immunotherapy remains unknown. METHODS: In this retrospective study between January 2016 and December 2018 at Gustave Roussy Cancer Campus, 1151 cancer patients treated with anti-PD-(L)1 immunotherapy were systematically monitored with serum CPK measurements before each immunotherapy cycle. We considered significant CPK increases according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v5.0 (CTCAEV5) of grade >=2 severity. Comparisons were performed in patients with immune-related CPK (ir-CPK) elevations symptomatic versus asymptomatic. RESULTS: Overall, 53 of 1151 (4.6%) patients showed a CPK increase. Elevations of CPK were deemed to be immunotherapy-related in 31 of 1151 (2.7%) patients. Among them, 12 of 31 (38.7%) patients experienced symptomatic cardiac or neuromuscular irAE, whereas the other 19 of 31 (61.3%) patients remained asymptomatic.

In the asymptomatic group, all patients experienced a spontaneous resolution of the ir-CPK increase, and none required medical intervention. CONCLUSION: Most patients with immune-related CPK increase remained asymptomatic. The CPK serum increase did not alter the clinical management of asymptomatic patients. The results of this study did not support a significant clinical interest for a systematic routine CPK monitoring in patients amenable to anti-PD-(L)1 immunotherapy."

Functionally, Tfap2b is required for only a few late-stage embryonic melanocytes, and is essential for McSC-dependent melanocyte regeneration. Fate mapping data reveal that tfap2b+ McSCs have multifate potential, and are the cells of origin for large patches of adult melanocytes, two other pigment cell types (iridophores and xanthophores), and nerve-associated cells. Hence, Tfap2b confers McSC identity in early development, distinguishing McSCs from other neural crest and pigment cell lineages, and retains multifate potential in the adult zebrafish."

The former 2 patients respectively received 33 Gy by IORT alone and 30 Gy by IORT in combination with 50 Gy of external beam radiotherapy (EBRT), and survived for 12 and 9 months. The latter 17 patients had received EBRT at 4 to 112 months before IORT. In this group, single doses of 23-40 Gy were delivered by IORT after removing as much tumor as possible. The median survival time after IORT was 12 months for 9 patients with glioblastoma or anaplastic astrocytoma, while it was 51 months for 8 patients with less infiltrative tumors (ependymoma, anaplastic ependymoma, and anaplastic oligodendroglioma). One patient with ependymoma and another with anaplastic ependymoma are currently alive with no evidence of disease at 7 and 11 years after IORT, respectively. Symptomatic brain necrosis occurred in 3 patients following IORT, but the symptoms were relieved in 2 of them by the removal of necrotic brain tissue. It is concluded that IORT combined with extensive tumor removal has an acceptable toxicity in previously irradiated patients and can be effective for selected recurrent malignant brain tumors."

The bacterial cell wall component, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), is thought to initiate tissue responses leading to PPROM in the setting of Gram negative infection. LPS is recognized by the innate immune system, including the proteins encoded by the CARD15 and TLR4 genes. A recently described mutation (2936insC) in CARD15 and a polymorphism in TLR4 896 A>G impair responses to LPS. The objective of this study was to determine if African Americans, who have a higher incidence of PPROM than Caucasians, have different frequencies of the mutant CARD15 allele and the TLR4 hyporesponsive variant, and if risk of PPROM is influenced by fetal carriage of these alleles. The allele frequencies for the CARD15 mutation and the TLR4 896G variant in African Americans were similar to those reported for Caucasians. There was no association between the TLR4 alleles examined and PPROM. However, the CARD15 mutation was only detected in controls and not in PPROM cases. We conclude that the CARD15 mutation and hyporesponsive TLR4 allele do not contribute to ethnic variation in the incidence of PPROM."

        "text": "The p53 tumor suppressor gene and nuclear protein: basic science review and relevance in the management of bladder cancer.\nPURPOSE: An extensive body of literature regarding p53 has accumulated during the last 2 decades. The cellular mechanisms of p53 are complex yet well-defined, whereas its clinical usefulness in the management of bladder cancer remains controversial. We outline the basic constitutive functions of p53 and summarize its current role in the management of transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a MEDLINE based literature review concerning the fundamental mechanisms of p53 and its role in the management of bladder cancer. RESULTS: The p53 gene is a tumor suppressor gene that acts as \"guardian of the genome.\" Many diverse cellular events, including DNA damage and hypoxia, activate the p53 gene. The p53 protein functions as a transcription factor, regulating downstream genes involved in cell cycle arrest, DNA repair and programmed cell death. Loss of p53 function confers genomic instability, impaired apoptosis and diminished cell cycle restraint. Therefore, p53 mutations select for certain critical features of malignancy. Alteration of P53 is the most common mutation in human cancer. Roughly half of all human malignancies, including many urological cancers, exhibit p53 mutations. In bladder cancer p53 mutations have been associated with higher tumor grade and advanced stage, as well as progression of superficial disease to muscle invasion. Moreover, p53 nuclear over expression appears to be an independent predictor of disease progression and decreased survival after cystectomy. CONCLUSIONS: The importance of p53 mutation in tumor cell biology is irrefutable. Wild-type p53 mediates imperative functions such as regulation of the cell cycle and programmed cell death. Deficiency of p53 function by mutation or inactivation abrogates normal cell cycle checkpoints and apoptosis, generating a favorable milieu for genomic instability and carcinogenesis. However, despite the manifest importance of p53 in human malignancy, its current role in the management of bladder cancer appears somewhat limited. A multitude of retrospective studies have associated p53 mutations with adverse outcomes in superficial and muscle invasive disease. Nonetheless, randomized prospective studies are needed to determine the potential clinical implications of p53 in bladder cancer."

Population-based case-control studies carried out in seven countries as part of the SEARCH Program compared data for 1,218 cases of childhood brain tumors and 2,223 controls (1976-1994). Parental occupational exposure to PAH during the 5-year period before birth was estimated with a job exposure matrix. Risk estimates were adjusted for child's age, sex, and study center. Paternal preconceptional occupational exposure to PAH was associated with increased risks of all childhood brain tumors (odds ratio (OR) = 1.3, 95% confidence interval: 1.1, 1.6) and astroglial tumors (OR = 1.4, 95% confidence interval: 1.1, 1.7). However, there was no trend of increasing risk with predicted level of exposure. Paternal smoking alone (OR = 1.4) was also associated with the risk of astroglial tumors in comparison with nonsmoking, non-occupationally-exposed fathers. Risks for paternal occupational exposure were higher, with (OR = 1.6) or without (OR = 1.7) smoking. Maternal occupational exposure to PAH before conception or during pregnancy was rare, and this exposure was not associated with any type of childhood brain tumor. This large study supports the hypothesis that paternal preconceptional exposure to PAH increases the risk of brain tumors in humans."

Various mutations have been identified in the RPS19 gene, but no investigations regarding the effect of these alterations on RPS19 mRNA levels have been performed. It is well established that mutated mRNA containing a premature stop codon (PTC) or lacking a stop codon can be rapidly degraded by specific mechanisms called nonsense mediated decay (NMD) and nonstop decay. To study the involvement of such mechanisms in DBA, we analyzed immortalized lymphoblastoid cells and primary fibroblasts from patients presenting different kinds of mutations in the RPS19 gene, generating allelic deletion, missense, nonsense, and nonstop messengers. We found that RPS19 mRNA levels are decreased in the cells with allelic deletion and, to a variable extent, also in all the cell lines with PTC or nonstop mutations. Further analysis showed that translation inhibition causes a stabilization of the mutated RPS19 mRNA. Our findings indicate that NMD and nonstop decay affect the expression of mutated RPS19 genes; this may help to clarify genotype-phenotype correlations in DBA."

        "text": "A comparison of the chronic treatment effects of venlafaxine and other antidepressants on serotonin and norepinephrine transporters.\nBACKGROUND: Venlafaxine blocks both serotonin and norepinephrine transporters (SERT and NET), with higher affinity for SERT. Serotonergic effects occur with lower doses, whereas both serotonergic and noradrenergic effects occur with higher doses of venlafaxine. Chronic treatment of rats with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors decreases SERT binding sites, whereas similar treatment with selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors decreases NET binding sites. We hypothesized that venlafaxine would affect monoamine transporters dose-dependently, with low doses causing selective reduction of SERT binding sites and higher doses reducing both SERT and NET binding sites. METHODS: Rats were treated for 21 days with a low (15 mg/kg/day) or high (70 mg/kg/day) dose of venlafaxine, vehicle, or other antidepressants. The SERT and NET density was determined by quantitative autoradiography. RESULTS: Neither dose of venlafaxine nor amitriptyline reduced binding to either the SERT or NET. In rats with noradrenergic terminals destroyed by 6-hydroxydopamine, venlafaxine still failed to reduce SERT binding. Also, rats treated simultaneously with sertraline plus desipramine exhibited reductions in both SERT and NET binding. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic venlafaxine treatment affected SERT and NET binding differently from paroxetine or desipramine. The inability of venlafaxine to reduce SERT or NET binding sites is not due to its dual uptake inhibiting properties."

We explored the connection between DNA replication and Ty1 retromobility by investigating the basis of increased retromobility in an rrm3 mutant. Even though Ty1 cDNA levels are increased in the absence of RRM3, neither the level nor target-site specificity of cDNA integration was altered. Instead, cDNA was incorporated into the genome by a Rad52-dependent mechanism that did not involve gene conversion of genomic Ty1 sequences. In rrm3 isolates, incorporated cDNA was often present in tandem arrays. Multimeric cDNA arrays probably arise during chromosomal break repair, since their appearance was strongly correlated with the formation of gross chromosomal rearrangements. Moreover, Ty1 multimers were invariantly located on rearranged chromosomes, when present. Overexpression of a cellular RNase H, which degrades RNA in an RNA:DNA hybrid, completely suppressed the increase in Ty1 multimer formation in an rrm3 mutant. We propose that RNA:DNA hybrid regions within nascent retrotransposition events block replication in an rrm3 mutant, leading to chromosome breaks within Ty1 sequences. Multiple extragenomic Ty1 cDNA molecules are then used as donors in recombinational repair of the break before it is healed."

A mode of genetic regulation that involves insulators and insulator binding proteins to establish independent transcriptional units is currently not known in nematodes including Caenorhabditis elegans. We therefore searched in nematodes for orthologs of proteins that are involved in chromatin insulation. RESULTS: While orthologs for other insulator proteins were absent in all 35 analysed nematode species, we find orthologs of CTCF in a subset of nematodes. As an example for these we cloned the Trichinella spiralis CTCF-like gene and revealed a genomic structure very similar to the Drosophila counterpart. To investigate the pattern of CTCF occurrence in nematodes, we performed phylogenetic analysis with the ZF protein sets of completely sequenced nematodes. We show that three ZF proteins from three basal nematodes cluster together with known CTCF proteins whereas no zinc finger protein of C. elegans and other derived nematodes does so. CONCLUSION: Our findings show that CTCF and possibly chromatin insulation are present in basal nematodes. We suggest that the insulator protein CTCF has been secondarily lost in derived nematodes like C. elegans. We propose a switch in the regulation of gene expression during nematode evolution, from the common vertebrate and insect type involving distantly acting regulatory elements and chromatin insulation to a so far poorly characterised mode present in more derived nematodes. Here, all or some of these components are missing. Instead operons, polycistronic transcriptional units common in derived nematodes, seemingly adopted their function."

It is thought to be responsible for the extended survival of CLL cells in vivo. Dickkopf1 (DKK1) is known to antagonize Wnt signaling by direct high-affinity binding to the extracellular domain of WNT coreceptor lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6). The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of DKK1 in B-CLL cells in vitro. METHODS: Expression of DKK1 was estimated by Western blot and real-time PCR. B cells from patients with CLL and healthy donors were incubated with recombinant DKK1. Survival was measured by flow cytometry. Primers for real-time PCR were designed for extracellular domain of LRP6, responsible for DKK1 binding, and the intracellular region, essential for inhibiting GSK3 beta. RESULTS: Healthy and CLL cells express equivalent mRNA levels of DKK1 and LRP6. After treatment of CLL cells with recombinant DKK1 (1 mug/mL) for 3 h, there was no change in the levels of phosphorylated beta-catenin and total beta-catenin. Healthy B cells proved to have significantly higher levels of extracellular, DKK1 binding domain of LRP6. We estimated that in CLL cells every 6th LRP6 receptor is lacking the extracellular domain. DISCUSSION: For the first time we show the expression of DKK1 in CLL cells. Unlike in similar tumors, the addition of DKK1 to culture of CLL cells does not inactivate WNT pathway. The reason for this could be the absence of the binding domain of LRP6. On the other hand, a truncated LRP6 without extracellular DKK1 binding domain could lead to an uncontrollable activation of WNT signaling."

It has been administered successfully for the treatment of erythema nodosum leprosum, aphthous ulceration and cachexia in HIV disease, inflammatory bowel diseases, and several malignant diseases. The suppressive effect of thalidomide on the activation of the nuclear transcription factor NF-kappaB may explain these effects of thalidomide. NF-kappaB is retained in the cytoplasm with IkappaBalpha, and is activated by a wide variety of inflammatory stimuli including TNF, IL-1 and endotoxin followed by its translocation to the nucleus. Angiogenesis and organogenesis also require gene transcription and signal translocation. The findings shed new light on the anti-inflammatory properties of thalidomide and suggest pharmaceutical actions of thalidomide via interference of transcription mechanism.

        "text": "Anti-fibrinolytic use for minimising perioperative allogeneic blood transfusion.\nBACKGROUND: Concerns regarding the safety of transfused blood have led to the development of a range of interventions to minimise blood loss during major surgery. Anti-fibrinolytic drugs are widely used, particularly in cardiac surgery, and previous reviews have found them to be effective in reducing blood loss, the need for transfusion, and the need for re-operation due to continued or recurrent bleeding. In the last few years questions have been raised regarding the comparative performance of the drugs. The safety of the most popular agent, aprotinin, has been challenged, and it was withdrawn from world markets in May 2008 because of concerns that it increased the risk of cardiovascular complications and death. OBJECTIVES: To assess the comparative effects of the anti-fibrinolytic drugs aprotinin, tranexamic acid (TXA), and epsilon aminocaproic acid (EACA) on blood loss during surgery, the need for red blood cell (RBC) transfusion, and adverse events, particularly vascular occlusion, renal dysfunction, and death. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched: the Cochrane Injuries Group's Specialised Register (July 2010), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2010, Issue 3), MEDLINE (Ovid SP) 1950 to July 2010, EMBASE (Ovid SP) 1980 to July 2010. References in identified trials and review articles were checked and trial authors were contacted to identify any additional studies. The searches were last updated in July 2010. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of anti-fibrinolytic drugs in adults scheduled for non-urgent surgery. Eligible trials compared anti-fibrinolytic drugs with placebo (or no treatment), or with each other. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. This version of the review includes a sensitivity analysis excluding trials authored by Prof. Joachim Boldt. MAIN RESULTS: This review summarises data from 252 RCTs that recruited over 25,000 participants. Data from the head-to-head trials suggest an advantage of aprotinin over the lysine analogues TXA and EACA in terms of reducing perioperative blood loss, but the differences were small. Compared to control, aprotinin reduced the probability of requiring RBC transfusion by a relative 34% (relative risk [RR] 0.66, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.60 to 0.72). The RR for RBC transfusion with TXA was 0.61 (95% CI 0.53 to 0.70) and was 0.81 (95% CI 0.67 to 0.99) with EACA. When the pooled estimates from the head-to-head trials of the two lysine analogues were combined and compared to aprotinin alone, aprotinin appeared more effective in reducing the need for RBC transfusion (RR 0.90; 95% CI 0.81 to 0.99).Aprotinin reduced the need for re-operation due to bleeding by a relative 54% (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.62). This translates into an absolute risk reduction of 2% and a number needed-to-treat (NNT) of 50 (95% CI 33 to 100). A similar trend was seen with EACA (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.99) but not TXA (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.17). The blood transfusion data were heterogeneous and funnel plots indicate that trials of aprotinin and the lysine analogues may be subject to publication bias.When compared with no treatment aprotinin did not increase the risk of myocardial infarction (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.11), stroke (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.52), renal dysfunction (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.54) or overall mortality (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.06). Similar trends were seen with the lysine analogues, but data were sparse. These data conflict with the results of recently published non-randomised studies, which found increased risk of cardiovascular complications and death with aprotinin. There are concerns about the adequacy of reporting of uncommon events in the small clinical trials included in this review.When aprotinin was compared directly with either, or both, of the two lysine analogues it resulted in a significant increase in the risk of death (RR 1.39, 95% CI 1.02, 1.89), and a non-significant increase in the risk of myocardial infarction (RR 1.11 95% CI 0.82, 1.50). Most of the data contributing to this added risk came from a single study - the BART trial (2008). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Anti-fibrinolytic drugs provide worthwhile reductions in blood loss and the receipt of allogeneic red cell transfusion. Aprotinin appears to be slightly more effective than the lysine analogues in reducing blood loss and the receipt of blood transfusion. However, head to head comparisons show a lower risk of death with lysine analogues when compared with aprotinin. The lysine analogues are effective in reducing blood loss during and after surgery, and appear to be free of serious adverse effects."

Brain MRI showed prominent atrophy in the left frontal dorsal and lateral regions and mild atrophy of the left superior temporal gyrus and left parietal gyri. Interictal PET revealed decreased glucose metabolism in the atrophic regions. Functional MRI demonstrated that the inferior frontal and inferior parieto-occipital regions of the right hemisphere were activated by language testing. Invasive EEG revealed that the left lateral temporal lobe was the sole source of her seizures.

Recurrent genetic alterations in defined genes in association with perturbations of developmental cell signaling pathways have been associated with PDAC development and progression. Here, we show that GATA6 contributes to pancreatic carcinogenesis during the temporal progression of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia by virtue of Wnt pathway activation. GATA6 is recurrently amplified by both quantitative-PCR and fluorescent in-situ hybridization in human pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia and in PDAC tissues, and GATA6 copy number is significantly correlated with overall patient survival. Forced overexpression of GATA6 in cancer cell lines enhanced cell proliferation and colony formation in soft agar in vitro and growth in vivo, as well as increased Wnt signaling. By contrast siRNA mediated knockdown of GATA6 led to corresponding decreases in these same parameters. The effects of GATA6 were found to be due to its ability to bind DNA, as forced overexpression of a DNA-binding mutant of GATA6 had no effects on cell growth in vitro or in vivo, nor did they affect Wnt signaling levels in these same cells. A microarray analysis revealed the Wnt antagonist Dickopf-1 (DKK1) as a dysregulated gene in association with GATA6 knockdown, and direct binding of GATA6 to the DKK1 promoter was confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation and electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Transient transfection of GATA6, but not mutant GATA6, into cancer cell lines led to decreased DKK1 mRNA expression and secretion of DKK1 protein into culture media. Forced overexpression of DKK1 antagonized the effects of GATA6 on Wnt signaling in pancreatic cancer cells. These findings illustrate that one mechanism by which GATA6 promotes pancreatic carcinogenesis is by virtue of its activation of canonical Wnt signaling via regulation of DKK1."

Diagnosis of thyroid disorders in patients after heart transplant in the early post-operative period and the implementation of correct treatment may prevent life-threatening complications. MATERIAL/METHODS: The aim of the study was to determine whether the complicated postoperative course (ie, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism or low fT3 syndrome) in patients in the first month after heart transplantation was connected with impaired thyroid hormone management. The analysis encompassed material from 98 patients treated with heart transplantation between February 9, 2004 and January 4, 2010. Hyperthyroidism was diagnosed in 21 patients (19M/2F, 52+-7 years of age), hypothyroidism in was diagnosed in 13 patients (10M/3F, 46+-12 years old), and low fT3 syndrome was diagnosed in 18 patients (14M/4F, 43+-12 years old). RESULTS: Patients with fT3 syndrome had the highest mortality (16.7%, NS), highest incidence of acute rejection (38.9%, NS), highest number of reoperations (27.8%, NS), and highest incidence of bacterial (16.7%, NS) and fungal infections (11.1%, NS). Cytomegaloviral infections occurred most frequently in patients with hyperthyroidism (23.8%, NS).

Aurora B is overexpressed in many types of human cancers, which has made it an attractive target for cancer therapies. Tumor suppressor p53 is a genome guardian and important negative regulator of the cell cycle. Whether Aurora B and p53 are coordinately regulated during the cell cycle is not known. We report that Aurora B directly interacts with p53 at different subcellular localizations and during different phases of the cell cycle (for instance, at the nucleus in interphase and the centromeres in prometaphase of mitosis). We show that Aurora B phosphorylates p53 at S183, T211, and S215 to accelerate the degradation of p53 through the polyubiquitination-proteasome pathway, thus functionally suppressing the expression of p53 target genes involved in cell cycle inhibition and apoptosis (e.g., p21 and PUMA). Pharmacologic inhibition of Aurora B in cancer cells with WT p53 increased p53 protein level and expression of p53 target genes to inhibit tumor growth. Together, these results define a mechanism of p53 inactivation during the cell cycle and imply that oncogenic hyperactivation or overexpression of Aurora B may compromise the tumor suppressor function of p53. We have elucidated the antineoplastic mechanism for Aurora B kinase inhibitors in cancer cells with WT p53."

In conclusion, this study suggest that TNF-alpha promotes RPE cell migration by inducing MMP-9 expression through activation of Akt/ mTORC1, but not mTORC2 signaling."

        "text": "Calcium leak through ryanodine receptors leads to atrial fibrillation in 3 mouse models of catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia.\nRATIONALE: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia, however the mechanism(s) causing AF remain poorly understood and therapy is suboptimal. The ryanodine receptor (RyR2) is the major calcium (Ca2+) release channel on the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) required for excitation-contraction coupling in cardiac muscle. OBJECTIVE: In the present study, we sought to determine whether intracellular diastolic SR Ca2+ leak via RyR2 plays a role in triggering AF and whether inhibiting this leak can prevent AF. METHODS AND RESULTS: We generated 3 knock-in mice with mutations introduced into RyR2 that result in leaky channels and cause exercise induced polymorphic ventricular tachycardia in humans [catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT)]. We examined AF susceptibility in these three CPVT mouse models harboring RyR2 mutations to explore the role of diastolic SR Ca2+ leak in AF. AF was stimulated with an intra-esophageal burst pacing protocol in the 3 CPVT mouse models (RyR2-R2474S+/-, 70%; RyR2-N2386I+/-, 60%; RyR2-L433P+/-, 35.71%) but not in wild-type (WT) mice (P<0.05). Consistent with these in vivo results, there was a significant diastolic SR Ca2+ leak in atrial myocytes isolated from the CPVT mouse models. Calstabin2 (FKBP12.6) is an RyR2 subunit that stabilizes the closed state of RyR2 and prevents a Ca2+ leak through the channel. Atrial RyR2 from RyR2-R2474S+/- mice were oxidized, and the RyR2 macromolecular complex was depleted of calstabin2. The Rycal drug S107 stabilizes the closed state of RyR2 by inhibiting the oxidation/phosphorylation induced dissociation of calstabin2 from the channel. S107 reduced the diastolic SR Ca2+ leak in atrial myocytes and decreased burst pacing-induced AF in vivo. S107 did not reduce the increased prevalence of burst pacing-induced AF in calstabin2-deficient mice, confirming that calstabin2 is required for the mechanism of action of the drug. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates that RyR2-mediated diastolic SR Ca2+ leak in atrial myocytes is associated with AF in CPVT mice. Moreover, the Rycal S107 inhibited diastolic SR Ca2+ leak through RyR2 and pacing-induced AF associated with CPVT mutations."

However, studies elucidating the role and the mechanism(s) of action of hesperetin in cervical cancer are sparse. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of the antiproliferative and apoptotic actions exerted by hesperetin on human cervical cancer SiHa cells. The viability of SiHa cells was evaluated using the MTT assay, apoptosis by acridine orange/ethidium bromide, propidium iodide, TUNEL assay, and Annexin V-Cy3, cell cycle distribution and mitochondrial transmembrane potential using flow cytometry, and apoptotic marker genes using quantitative real-time PCR. The treatment of SiHa cells with hesperetin (IC50, 650 mum) showed a marked concentration- and time-dependent inhibition of proliferation and induced the G2/M phase in a dose-dependent manner after 24 h. There was an attenuation of mitochondrial membrane potential with increased expression of caspase-3, caspase-8, caspase-9, p53, Bax, and Fas death receptor and its adaptor protein Fas-associated death domain-containing protein (FADD), indicating the participation of both death receptor- and mitochondria-related mechanisms. Furthermore, hesperetin-induced apoptosis was confirmed by TUNEL and Annexin V-Cy3. This study shows that hesperetin exhibits a potential anticancer activity against human cervical cancer cell lines in vitro through the reduction in cell viability and the induction of apoptosis. Altogether, these data sustain our contention that hesperetin has anticancer properties and merits further investigation as a potential therapeutic agent."

We propose that PPROM occurs in the setting of long-standing altered tissue remodeling, which creates a vulnerable environment for the fetal membranes and pregnancy. We tested the hypothesis that PPROM is the result of tissue remodeling in the fetal membranes, specifically the chorion, and this weakening of the chorion compromises the protection provided to the amnion. The purpose of this study was to quantify thickness and apoptosis in the choriodecidua of fetal membranes in patients with PPROM, preterm labor (PTL), preterm no labor (PTNL), and women with term labor (TERM). We conducted a retrospective evaluation of fetal membrane samples from 86 placentas. Immunohistochemistry was performed using a cytokeratin antibody, and mean chorion cellular thickness was compared between each clinical group. To evaluate chorion apoptosis, fetal membranes from patients with PPROM, PTL, and TERM were stained with the M30 antibody, and the degree of cellular apoptosis was determined. Statistical analysis was performed using analysis of variance with corrections for multiple comparisons. The chorion cellular layer was thinner in patients with PPROM compared to patients with PTNL and TERM (62, 140, and 169 microm, respectively, P < .0001), though not significantly different from PTL (95 microm, P > .05). The percentage of apoptotic cells within the chorion among the patients with PPROM was greater compared to PTL and TERM (24.2%, 13.1%, and 8.4%, respectively, P < .001). The chorion cellular layer is thinner and demonstrates increased apoptosis in PPROM compared to patients with PTL, PTNL, and TERM, suggesting differential remodeling between clinical phenotypes. "

Cytosolic ferritins are composed of heavy (H) and light (L) subunits that co-assemble into a hollow spherical shell with an internal cavity where iron is stored. The ferroxidase activity of the ferritin H chain is critical to store iron in its Fe3+ oxidation state, while the L chain shows iron nucleation properties. We describe a unique case of a 23-yr-old female patient affected by a homozygous loss of function mutation in the L-ferritin gene, idiopathic generalized seizures, and atypical restless leg syndrome (RLS). We show that L chain ferritin is undetectable in primary fibroblasts from the patient, and thus ferritin consists only of H chains. Increased iron incorporation into the FtH homopolymer leads to reduced cellular iron availability, diminished levels of cytosolic catalase, SOD1 protein levels, enhanced ROS production and higher levels of oxidized proteins. Importantly, key phenotypic features observed in fibroblasts are also mirrored in reprogrammed neurons from the patient's fibroblasts. Our results demonstrate for the first time the pathophysiological consequences of L-ferritin deficiency in a human and help to define the concept for a new disease entity hallmarked by idiopathic generalized seizure and atypical RLS.

TLKs maintain genomic stability and are important therapeutic intervention targets. We identified specific inhibitors of TLKs from several compound libraries, some of which belong to the family of phenothiazine antipsychotics.

The inhibitor thioridazine (THD) potentiated tumor killing with chemotherapy and also had activity alone. Staining for gamma-H2AX revealed few positive cells in untreated tumors, but large numbers in mice treated with low doxorubicin or THD alone, possibly the result of the accumulation of DSBs that are not promptly repaired as they may occur in the harsh tumor growth environment.

Genetically reducing globally the expression of the ETS transcription factor FLI1 by 50% in two lupus mouse models significantly improves disease measures and survival through an unknown mechanism. In this study we analyze the effects of reducing FLI1 in the MRL/lpr lupus prone model on T cell function. We demonstrate that adoptive transfer of MRL/lpr Fli1(+/+) or Fli1(+/-) T cells and B cells into Rag1-deficient mice results in significantly decreased serum immunoglobulin levels in animals receiving Fli1(+/-) lupus T cells compared to animals receiving Fli1(+/+) lupus T cells regardless of the genotype of co-transferred lupus B cells. Ex vivo analyses of MRL/lpr T cells demonstrated that Fli1(+/-) T cells produce significantly less IL-4 during early and late disease and exhibited significantly decreased TCR-specific activation during early disease compared to Fli1(+/+) T cells. Moreover, the Fli1(+/-) T cells expressed significantly less neuraminidase 1 (Neu1) message and decreased NEU activity during early disease and significantly decreased levels of glycosphingolipids during late disease compared to Fli1(+/+) T cells. FLI1 dose-dependently activated the Neu1 promoter in mouse and human T cell lines. Together, our results suggest reducing FLI1 in lupus decreases the pathogenicity of T cells by decreasing TCR-specific activation and IL-4 production in part through the modulation of glycosphingolipid metabolism. Reducing the expression of FLI1 or targeting the glycosphingolipid metabolic pathway in lupus may serve as a therapeutic approach to treating lupus."

In addition, relapse frequently occurs after application of conventional chemotherapy in CLL. Recently several new chemo-free treatment options have been introduced within clinical trials. Among them are monoclonal antibodies, most of them targeting the CD20 molecule: besides the licensed drugs rituximab and ofatumumab obinutuzumab, although in combination with chemotherapy, has recently shown high clinical efficacy in front-line treatment of elderly patients with CLL. Lenalidomide as monotherapy has demonstrated clinical efficacy in patients with relapsed disease and first data within clinical trials have been generated in the front-line setting. A promising class of novel agents has been designed to block aberrant signaling from the B-cell receptor. Ibrutinib acts by inhibiting the Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) while idelalisib represents a first-in-class specific inhibitor of the phosphoinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) delta isoform. Another class of drugs with potential impact for chemo-free treatment strategies in CLL are the BH3-mimetic inhibitors of the Bcl-2 family of pro-survival proteins. Other interesting candidate drugs that are currently explored for CLL patients include small modular immunopharmaceutical (SMIP) proteins (e. g. TRU-016), CDK inhibitors (e. g. dinaciclib), HDAC inhibitors and others. Given all these novel agents and targets, chemo-free or at least chemo-reduced concepts may become reality in the near future for our patients suffering from CLL. "

Recent clinical trials including the results of a Phase I trial in hematologic malignancies and a Phase II trial of pidilizumab following autologous hematopoietic stem-cell transplant (AHSCT) are reviewed. EXPERT OPINION: We review data that suggest that PD-1 is a promising target in the treatment and management of DLBCL. Changes in immune subsets following administration of pidilizumab are felt to represent on-target responses. The improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) following AHSCT supports a response to therapy.

In this study, we examined the fate of various testicular cells in adult mouse testes following ectopic autografting at 1, 2, 4 and 8 weeks post grafting. Histological examination showed no evidence of re-establishment of spermatogenesis in autografts, and progressive degeneration of seminiferous tubules was detected. Expression of germ cell-specific proteins such as POU5F1, DAZL, TNP1, TNP2, PRM1 and PRM2 revealed that, although proliferating and differentiating spermatogenic germ cells such as spermatogonia, spermatocytes and spermatids could survive in autografts until 4 weeks, only terminally differentiated germ cells such as sperm persisted in autografts until 8 weeks. The presence of Sertoli and peritubular myoid cells, as indicated by expression of WT1 and ACTA2 proteins, respectively, was evident in the autografts until 8 weeks. Interestingly, seminal vesicle weight and serum testosterone level were restored in autografted mice by 8 weeks post grafting. The expression of Leydig cell-specific proteins such as CYP11A1, HSD3B2 and LHCGR showed revival of Leydig cell (LC) populations in autografts over time since grafting. Elevated expression of PDGFRA, LIF, DHH and NEFH in autografts indicated de novo regeneration of LC populations. Autografted adult testis can be used as a model for investigating Leydig cell regeneration, steroidogenesis and regulation of the intrinsic factors involved in Leydig cell development. The success of this rodent model can have therapeutic applications for adult human males undergoing sterilizing cancer therapy. "

We quantified differences in structural disorder and dynamics for an open conformation of SERCA versus closed structures and observed that dynamic motions of SERCA cytoplasmic domains decreased with decreasing domain-domain separation distance. The results are useful for interpretation of recent intramolecular Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) distance measurements obtained for SERCA fused to fluorescent protein tags. Those previous physical measurements revealed several discrete structural substates and suggested open conformations of SERCA are more dynamic than compact conformations. The present simulations support this hypothesis and provide additional details of SERCA molecular mechanisms. Specifically, all-atoms simulations revealed large-scale translational and rotational motions of the SERCA N-domain relative to the A- and P-domains during the transition from an open to a closed headpiece conformation over the course of a 400 ns trajectory. The open-to-closed structural transition was accompanied by a disorder-to-order transition mediated by an initial interaction of an N-domain loop (Nbeta5-beta6, residues 426-436) with residues 133-139 of the A-domain. Mutation of three negatively charged N-domain loop residues abolished the disorder-to-order transition and prevented the initial domain-domain interaction and subsequent closure of the cytoplasmic headpiece. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations were in harmony with all-atoms simulations and physical measurements and revealed a close communication between fluorescent protein tags and the domain to which they were fused. The data indicate that previous intramolecular FRET distance measurements report SERCA structure changes with high fidelity and suggest a structural mechanism that facilitates the closure of the SERCA cytoplasmic headpiece.

OBJECTIVE: A Xenopus transgenic line allowing conditional ablation of myelinating oligodendrocytes has been adapted for in vivo screening of remyelination-favoring molecules. METHODS: In this transgenic, the green fluorescent protein reporter is fused to E. coli nitroreductase and expressed specifically in myelinating oligodendrocytes. Nitroreductase converts the innocuous pro-drug metronidazole to a cytotoxin. Spontaneous remyelination occurs after metronidazole-induced demyelinating responses. As tadpoles are transparent, these events can be monitored in vivo and quantified. At the end of metronidazole-induced demyelination, tadpoles were screened in water containing the compounds tested. After 72 h, remyelination was assayed by counting numbers of oligodendrocytes per optic nerve. RESULTS: Among a battery of molecules tested, siponimod, a dual agonist of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 and 5, was among the most efficient favoring remyelination. Crispr/cas9 gene editing showed that the promyelinating effect of siponimod involves the sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 5.

There are no disease-modifying therapies for either FTD or NCL, in part because of a poor understanding of how mutations in genes such as GRN contribute to disease pathogenesis and neurodegeneration. By studying mice lacking progranulin (PGRN), the protein encoded by GRN, we discovered multiple lines of evidence that PGRN deficiency results in impairment of autophagy, a key cellular degradation pathway. PGRN-deficient mice are sensitive to Listeria monocytogenes because of deficits in xenophagy, a specialized form of autophagy that mediates clearance of intracellular pathogens. Cells lacking PGRN display reduced autophagic flux, and pathological forms of TDP-43 typically cleared by autophagy accumulate more rapidly in PGRN-deficient neurons.

A dose escalation and expansion phase I study evaluated the safety and activity of T-DXd in patients with advanced HER2-expressing/mutated solid tumors. Here, results for T-DXd at the recommended doses for expansion (RDE) in patients with HER2-low (immunohistochemistry [IHC] 1+ or IHC 2+/in situ hybridization-) breast cancer (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02564900) are reported. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients had advanced/metastatic HER2-low-expressing breast cancer refractory to standard therapies. The RDE of 5.4 or 6.4 mg/kg T-DXd were administered intravenously once every 3 weeks until withdrawal of consent, unacceptable toxicity, or progressive disease. Antitumor activity and safety were assessed. RESULTS: Between August 2016 and August 2018, 54 patients were enrolled and received >= 1 dose of T-DXd at the RDE. Patients were extensively pretreated (median, 7.5 prior therapies). The confirmed objective response rate by independent central review was 20/54 (37.0%; 95% CI, 24.3% to 51.3%) with median duration of response of 10.4 months (95% CI, 8.8 month to not evaluable). Most patients (53/54; 98.1%) experienced >= 1 treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE; grade >= 3; 34/54; 63.0%). Common (>= 5%) grade >= 3 TEAEs included decreases in neutrophil, platelet, and WBC counts; anemia; hypokalemia; AST increase; decreased appetite; and diarrhea. Three patients treated at 6.4 mg/kg suffered fatal events associated with T-DXd-induced interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis as determined by an independent adjudication committee. CONCLUSION: The novel HER2-targeted ADC, T-DXd, demonstrated promising preliminary antitumor activity in patients with HER2-low breast cancer. Most toxicities were GI or hematologic in nature. ILD is an important identified risk and should be monitored closely and proactively managed."

SCA3 was first described in Azorean individuals and has interesting epidemiological patterns. It is characterized clinically by progressive ataxia and neuropathologically by progressive degenerative changes in the spinal cord and cerebellum, along with degeneration of the cortex and basal ganglia. Here, we describe the clinical and neuropathologic features in a case of SCA3 with unique findings, including involvement of the inferior olivary nucleus and cerebellar Purkinje cell layer, which are classically spared in the disease. We also discuss research into the disease mechanisms of SCA3 and the potential for therapeutic intervention."

Epigenetic modifications are important mechanisms that fine tune the expression of genes in response to extracellular signals and environmental changes. In vertebrates, crucial epigenetic reprogramming events occur during early embryogenesis and germ cell development. Chicken embryo, which develops external to the mother's body, can be easily manipulated in vivo and in vitro, and hence, it is an excellent model for performing epigenetic studies. Environmental factors such as temperature can affect the development of an embryo into the phenotype of an adult. A better understanding of the environmental impact on embryo development can be achieved by analyzing the direct effects of epigenetic modifications as well as their molecular background and their intergenerational and transgenerational inheritance. In this overview, the current possibility of epigenetic changes during chicken embryonic development and their effects on long-term postembryonic development are discussed."

Despite the well-established role of RAS in tumorigenesis, past efforts to develop small molecule inhibitors have failed for various reasons leading many to consider RAS as \"undruggable.\" Advances over the past decade with KRAS(G12C) mutation-specific inhibitors have culminated in the first FDA-approved RAS drug, sotorasib. However, the patient population that stands to benefit from KRAS(G12C) inhibitors is inherently limited to those patients harboring KRAS(G12C) mutations. Additionally, both intrinsic and acquired mechanisms of resistance have been reported that indicate allele-specificity may afford disadvantages. For example, the compensatory activation of uninhibited wild-type (WT) NRAS and HRAS isozymes can rescue cancer cells harboring KRAS(G12C) mutations from allele-specific inhibition or the occurrence of other mutations in KRAS. It is therefore prudent to consider alternative drug discovery strategies that may overcome these potential limitations. One such approach is pan-RAS inhibition, whereby all RAS isozymes co-expressed in the tumor cell population are targeted by a single inhibitor to block constitutively activated RAS regardless of the underlying mutation. This chapter provides a review of past and ongoing strategies to develop pan-RAS inhibitors in detail and seeks to outline the trajectory of this promising strategy of RAS inhibition."

The majority of mutations are located in exon 2, with the c.34G > T (p.G12C) change being the most prevalent. The clinical relevance of KRAS mutations in NSCLC was not recognized until a few years ago. What is now emerging is a dual key role played by KRAS mutations in the management of NSCLC patients.

Second, a KRAS inhibitor specifically targeting the c.34G > T (p.G12C) variant, Sotorasib, has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and by the European Medicines Agency. Another KRAS inhibitor targeting c.34G > T (p.G12C), Adagrasib, is currently being reviewed by the FDA for accelerated approval. From the description of the biology of KRAS-mutant NSCLC, the present review will focus on the clinical aspects of KRAS mutations in NSCLC, in particular on the emerging efficacy data of Sotorasib and other KRAS inhibitors, including mechanisms of resistance.

This report focuses on the further pharmacologic characterization of nefazodone and its metabolites within the serotonergic and noradrenergic systems, in comparison with other antidepressants. By use of radioligand binding assays, we measured the affinity (Ki) of 13 antidepressants and 6 metabolites for the rat and human SERT and NET. The Ki values for eight of the antidepressants and three metabolites were also determined for the rat 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A and muscarinic cholinergic receptors, the guinea pig histamine1 receptor and the human alpha-1 and alpha-2 receptors. These data are useful for predicting side effect profiles and the potential for pharmacodynamic drug-drug interactions of antidepressants. Of particular interest were the findings that paroxetine, generally thought of as a selective SERT antagonist, possesses moderately high affinity for the NET and that venlafaxine, which has been described as a \"dual uptake inhibitor\", possesses weak affinity for the NET. We observed significant correlations in SERT (r = 0.965) or NET (r = 0.983) affinity between rat and human transporters. Significant correlations were also observed between muscarinic cholinergic and NET affinity. There are several significant correlations between affinities for the 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, histamine1, alpha-1 and alpha-2 receptors. These novel findings, not widely described previously, suggest that many of the individual drugs studied in these experiments possess some structural characteristic that determines affinity for several G protein-coupled, but not muscarinic, receptors."

There are two orders of Zygomycetes containing organisms that cause human disease, the Mucorales and the Entomophthorales. The majority of human illness is caused by the Mucorales. While disease is most commonly linked to Rhizopus spp., other organisms are also associated with human infection, including Mucor, Rhizomucor, Absidia, Apophysomyces, Saksenaea, Cunninghamella, Cokeromyces, and Syncephalastrum spp. Although Mortierella spp. do cause disease in animals, there is no longer sufficient evidence to suggest that they are true human pathogens. The spores from these molds are transmitted by inhalation, via a variety of percutaneous routes, or by ingestion of spores. Human zygomycosis caused by the Mucorales generally occurs in immunocompromised hosts as opportunistic infections. Host risk factors include diabetes mellitus, neutropenia, sustained immunosuppressive therapy, chronic prednisone use, iron chelation therapy, broad-spectrum antibiotic use, severe malnutrition, and primary breakdown in the integrity of the cutaneous barrier such as trauma, surgical wounds, needle sticks, or burns. Zygomycosis occurs only rarely in immunocompetent hosts. The disease manifestations reflect the mode of transmission, with rhinocerebral and pulmonary diseases being the most common manifestations. Cutaneous, gastrointestinal, and allergic diseases are also seen. The Mucorales are associated with angioinvasive disease, often leading to thrombosis, infarction of involved tissues, and tissue destruction mediated by a number of fungal proteases, lipases, and mycotoxins. If the diagnosis is not made early, dissemination often occurs. Therapy, if it is to be effective, must be started early and requires combinations of antifungal drugs, surgical intervention, and reversal of the underlying risk factors. The Entomophthorales are closely related to the Mucorales on the basis of sexual growth by production of zygospores and by the production of coenocytic hyphae. Despite these similarities, the Entomophthorales and Mucorales have dramatically different gross morphologies, asexual reproductive characteristics, and disease manifestations. In comparison to the floccose aerial mycelium of the Mucorales, the Entomophthorales produce a compact, glabrous mycelium. The asexually produced spores of the Entomophthorales may be passively released or actively expelled into the environment. Human disease with these organisms occurs predominantly in tropical regions, with transmission occurring by implantation of spores via minor trauma such as insect bites or by inhalation of spores into the sinuses. Conidiobolus typically infects mucocutaneous sites to produce sinusitis disease, while Basidiobolus infections occur as subcutaneous mycosis of the trunk and extremities. The Entomophthorales are true pathogens, infecting primarily immunocompetent hosts. They generally do not invade blood vessels and rarely disseminate. Occasional cases of disseminated and angioinvasive disease have recently been described, primarily in immunocompromised patients, suggesting a possible emerging role for this organism as an opportunist."

Not only do such mutations result in the abrogation of wild-type p53 activity, but the expressed p53 mutant proteins also tend to gain oncogenic functions, such as interference with wild-type p53-independent apoptosis. Because p53 mutants are highly expressed in cancer cells and not in normal cells, their reactivation to wild-type p53 function may eliminate the cancer by apoptosis or another p53-dependent mechanism. Several studies that embarked on this quest for reactivation have succeeded in restoring wildtype p53 activity to several p53 mutants. However, mutants with more extensive structural changes in the DNA binding core domain may be refractory to reactivation to the wild-type p53 phenotype. Therefore, understanding the structure and functions of oncogenic p53 mutants may lead to more potent reactivation modalities or to the ability to eliminate mutant p53 gain of function."

Many children are given angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, which have been studied primarily in adults. We document the long-term effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in doxorubicin-treated survivors of childhood cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, we reviewed records of 18 children who had regular echocardiographic examinations during enalapril therapy (mean age at cancer diagnosis, 8 years; mean time between completion of doxorubicin therapy and start of enalapril, 7 years; median follow-up since the start of enalapril, 10 years). RESULTS: Over the first 6 years of enalapril therapy, there was progressive improvement toward normal values in LV dimension, afterload, fractional shortening, and mass, but all these parameters deteriorated between 6 and 10 years. LV wall thickness deteriorated throughout the study period, as did LV contractility and systolic blood pressure. Diastolic blood pressure fell slightly. By 6 years on enalapril, all six patients who had had congestive heart failure at the start of enalapril therapy had either died or undergone cardiac transplantation, compared with three of the 12 asymptomatic patients. CONCLUSION: In doxorubicin-treated long-term survivors of childhood cancer, enalapril-induced improvement in LV structure and function is transient. The primary defect, which is LV wall thinning, continues to deteriorate, and thus the short-term improvement was mostly related to lowered diastolic blood pressure."

Case-control studies suggest that the least transcriptionally active allele of the SERT gene promoter polymorphism (5-HTTLPR) has an increased frequency in AN patients. However, this finding was not replicated with 55 trios (AN child+parents) and the transmission disequilibrium test (TDT). To clarify the role of the 5-HTTLPR in susceptibility to AN, we used the TDT and 106 Australian trios to provide 93% power to detect a genotypic relative risk (GRR) of 2.0. Our results were negative for this GRR (McNemar's chi(2)=0.01, df=1, p=0.921, odds ratio 1.0, 95% CI 0.7-1.5). Additionally, we found no association with AN females, AN subtype, age at onset, or minimum BMI. We then performed the first reported investigation of epistasis between the SERT gene and norepinephrine transporter gene (SLC6A2, alias NET) in AN, as an earlier study suggested that atypical AN responds to the dual serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor venlafaxine. We observed no epistasis between the 5-HTTLPR and a polymorphism within the NET gene promoter polymorphic region (NETpPR) (chi(2)=0.48, df=1, p=0.490). Although 5-HTTLPR modulates serotonin reuptake by the serotonin transporter, our analyses provide no evidence that susceptibility to AN is modified by 5-HTTLPR alone, nor in concert with as yet undetermined functional effects of the NETpPR polymorphism."

Investigation of the neural basis of this disorder has been limited previously to neuroimaging of affected children and adults. The discovery of the gene responsible, FOXP2, offers a unique opportunity to explore the relevant neural mechanisms from a molecular perspective. In the present study, we have determined the detailed spatial and temporal expression pattern of FOXP2 mRNA in the developing brain of mouse and human. We find expression in several structures including the cortical plate, basal ganglia, thalamus, inferior olives and cerebellum. These data support a role for FOXP2 in the development of corticostriatal and olivocerebellar circuits involved in motor control. We find intriguing concordance between regions of early expression and later sites of pathology suggested by neuroimaging. Moreover, the homologous pattern of FOXP2/Foxp2 expression in human and mouse argues for a role for this gene in development of motor-related circuits throughout mammalian species. Overall, this study provides support for the hypothesis that impairments in sequencing of movement and procedural learning might be central to the FOXP2-related speech and language disorder."

The program, called the beta-barrel Outer Membrane protein Predictor (BOMP), is based on two separate components to recognize integral beta-barrel proteins. The first component is a C-terminal pattern typical of many integral beta-barrel proteins. The second component calculates an integral beta-barrel score of the sequence based on the extent to which the sequence contains stretches of amino acids typical of transmembrane beta-strands. The precision of the predictions was found to be 80% with a recall of 88% when tested on the proteins with SwissProt annotated subcellular localization in Escherichia coli K 12 (788 sequences) and Salmonella typhimurium (366 sequences). When tested on the predicted proteome of E.coli, BOMP found 103 of a total of 4346 polypeptide sequences to be possible integral beta-barrel proteins. Of these, 36 were found by BLAST to lack similarity (E-value score < 1e-10) to proteins with annotated subcellular localization in SwissProt.

The idea behind PPs is that if the products of two genes have a functional interdependence, the genes should both be either present or absent across genomes. One of the main problems with PPs is that evolutionarily close organisms tend to share a higher number of genes resulting in the overscoring of PP-relatedness. The proper measure of the overscoring effect of evolutionary redundancy requires examples of both functionally related genes (positive gold standards) and functionally unrelated genes (negative gold standards). Since experimentally verified functional interactions are only available for a few model organisms, there is a need for an alternative to gold standards. The presence of operons (polycistronic transcription units formed of functionally related genes) in prokaryotic genomes offers such an alternative. Genes in operons are located next to each other in the same DNA strand, and thus their presence should result in a higher proportion of predicted functional interactions among adjacent genes in the same strand than among adjacent genes in opposite strands. Under the preceding principle, we present a confidence value (CV) designed for evaluating predictions of functional interactions obtained using PPs. We first show that the CV corresponds to a positive predictive value calculated using experimentally known operons and further validate operon predictions based on this CV in other organisms using available microarray data. Then, we use a fixed CV of 0.90 as a reference to compare PP predictions obtained using different nonredundant genome datasets filtered at varying thresholds of genomic similarity. Our results demonstrate that nonredundant genome datasets increase the number of high-quality predictions by an average of 20%. Confidence values as those presented here should help compare other strategies and scoring systems to use phylogenetic profiles and other genomic context methods for predicting functional interactions."

The MCT-1 oncogene product has recently been shown to interact with the cap complex and to modulate the translational profile of cell lines when MCT-1 was highly expressed. The MCT-1 protein modifies mRNA translational profiles through its interaction with DENR/DRP, a protein containing an SUI1 domain involved in recognition of the translation initiation codon. It has been shown previously that the protein levels of DENR/DRP go up in parallel with increasing cell density, however the mechanism(s) underlying this increase is poorly understood at present. The 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR) of DENR/DRP was found to have a high number of uracyl (U)- and adenine (A)-rich sequences (AREs). Many RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) have been shown to recognize and bind to mRNAs that contains AREs generally present in the 3'UTR of mRNAs. RBPs binding to AREs such as AUF1, BRF1, KSRP, and TTP are known to regulate mRNA turnover, while TIAR and TIA-1 influence mRNA translation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We assessed the association of several ARE binding proteins with DENR/DRP mRNA by reverse transcription of the RNA obtained after immunoprecipitation of cell lysates from HEK 293 cells growing at varying levels of cell density. HEK 293 cells were transfected with an AUF1 silencing vector (shRNA), and protein levels of DENR/DRP were analyzed by Western blotting. RESULTS: We demonstrated that both HuR and AUF1 bind to discrete regions of DENR/DRP mRNA and that AUF1 silencing increases DENR/DRP protein levels.

It occurs in a wide variety of eukaryotic organisms and in some viruses. One of the most common forms of pre-mRNA editing is A-to-I editing, in which adenosine is deaminated to inosine, which is read as guanosine during translation. This phenomenon has been observed in numerous transcripts, including the mammalian 5-HT(2C) receptor, which can be edited at five distinct sites. Methods used to date to quantify 5-HT(2C) receptor editing are labor-intensive, expensive and provide limited information regarding the relative abundance of 5-HT(2C) receptor editing variants. Here, we present a novel, ultra high-throughput method to quantify 5-HT(2C) receptor editing, compare it to a more conventional method, and use it to assess the effect of a range of genetic and pharmacologic manipulations on 5-HT(2C) editing. We conclude that this new method is powerful and economical, and we provide evidence that alterations in 5-HT(2C) editing appear to be a result of regional changes in brain activity, rather than a mechanism to normalize 5-HT(2C) signaling."

Biomarker validation has therefore become a central topic of discussion in the field of medicine, primarily due to the changing landscape of therapies for treatment of a disease and these therapies purported mechanism(s) of action. PURPOSE: In this report, we discuss the merits and limitations of some of the clinical trial designs for predictive biomarker validation using examples from ongoing or completed clinical trials. METHODS: The designs are broadly classified as retrospective (i.e., using data from previously well-conducted randomized controlled trials (RCT)) versus prospective (enrichment or targeted, unselected or all-comers, hybrid, and adaptive analysis). We discuss some of these designs in the context of real trials. RESULTS: Well-designed retrospective analysis of prospective RCT can bring forward effective treatments to marker defined subgroup of patients in a timely manner. An example is the KRAS gene status in colorectal cancer - the benefit from cetuximab and panitumumab was demonstrated to be restricted to patients with wild type status based on prospectively specified analyses using data from previously conducted RCTs. Prospective enrichment designs are appropriate when compelling preliminary evidence suggests that not all patients will benefit from the study treatment under consideration; however, this may sometimes leave questions unanswered. An example is the established benefit of trastuzumab as adjuvant therapy for breast cancer; a clear definition of HER2-positivity and the assay reproducibility have, however, remained unanswered. An all-comers design is optimal where preliminary evidence regarding treatment benefit and assay reproducibility is uncertain (e.g., EGFR expression and tyrosine kinase inhibitors in lung cancer), or to identify the most effective therapy from a panel of regimens (e.g., chemotherapy options in breast cancer). LIMITATIONS: The designs discussed here rest on the assumption that the technical feasibility, assay performance metrics, and the logistics of specimen collection are well established and that initial results demonstrate promise with regard to the predictive ability of the marker(s). CONCLUSIONS: The choice of a clinical trial design is driven by a combination of scientific, clinical, statistical, and ethical considerations. There is no one size fits all solution to predictive biomarker validation."

There is interest in using thyromimetic agents as possible treatment options for heart failure based on data demonstrating the ability of these agents to improve systolic and diastolic left ventricular function as well as their vasodilatory action. The inverse relationship between heart failure severity and serum triiodothyronine (T3) levels has also been interpreted by some as an indication that thyroid hormone therapy might be useful. In the 1950s, investigators began developing thyroid hormone analogs that could lower cholesterol, that selectively bind to beta1-type nuclear thyroid hormone receptors (TR), which are responsible for cholesterol-lowering activity, without activating alpha1-type receptors in the heart. The identification of 3,5-diiodothyropropionic acid (DITPA) that binds to both alpha- and beta-type TRs with relatively low affinity was unique in that this analog improves left ventricular function in heart failure as well as lowers cholesterol. The aim of this review is to summarize information known about the interactions between thyroid hormones and the cardiovascular system, and the potential therapeutic effects of thyroid analogs in chronic heart disease.

For this reason it is called 'the guardian of the genome' and is considered one of the most important players in the development of cancer. However, more recently it has been show that p53 is not only involved in cancer, but also in ageing. p53 is stimulated by stress, which in turn results in the activation of a wide range of transcriptional targets. Low-intensity stress will activate p53 in a manner which results in antioxidant response, thus protecting against ageing because of its antioxidant function. On the contrary, high-intensity activation of p53 will result in an increase of oxidative stress by activation of p53-mediated pro-oxidant targets, thus increasing the rate of ageing, but protecting against cancer."

        "text": "Continuous antagonism by Dkk1 counter activates canonical Wnt signaling and promotes cardiomyocyte differentiation of embryonic stem cells.\nEmbryonic stem (ES) cells give rise to mesodermal progenitors that differentiate to hematopoietic and cardiovascular cells. The wnt signaling pathway plays multiple roles in cardiovascular development through a network of intracellular effectors. To monitor global changes in wnt signaling during ES cell differentiation, we generated independent ES cell lines carrying the luciferase gene under promoters that uniquely respond to specific wnt pathway branches. Our results show that successive, mutually exclusive waves of noncanonical and canonical wnt signaling precede mesoderm differentiation. Blocking the initial noncanonical JNK/AP-1 signaling with SP60125 aborts cardiovascular differentiation and promotes hematopoiesis, whereas interference with the subsequent peak of canonical wnt signaling using Dkk1 has the opposite effect. Dkk1 blockade triggers counter mechanisms that lead to delayed and extended activation of canonical wnt signaling and mesoderm differentiation that appear to favor the cardiomyocytic lineage at the expense of hematopoietic cells. The cardiomyocytic yield can be further enhanced by overexpression of Wnt11 leading to approximately 95-fold enrichment in contracting cells. Our results suggest that the initial noncanonical wnt signaling is necessary for subsequent activation of canonical signaling and that the latter operates under a regulatory loop which responds to suppression with hyperactivation of compensatory mechanisms. This model provides new insights on wnt signaling during ES cell differentiation and points to a method to induce cardiomyocytic differentiation without precise timing of wnt signaling manipulation. Taking into account the heterogeneity of pluripotent cells, these findings might present an advantage to enhance the cardiogenic potential of stem cells."

The most common pathological subtype, FTLD with transactive response DNA-binding protein with a molecular weight of 43 kDa inclusions (FTLD-TDP), is often caused by autosomal dominant mutations in the progranulin gene (GRN) encoding the progranulin protein (PGRN). GRN pathogenic mutations result in haploinsufficiency, usually by nonsense-mediated decay of the mRNA. Since the discovery of these mutations in 2006, several groups have published data and animal models that provide further insight into the genetic and functional relevance of PGRN in the context of FTLD-TDP. These studies were critical in initiating our understanding of the role of PGRN in neural development, degeneration, synaptic transmission, cell signaling, and behavior. Furthermore, recent publications have now identified the receptors for PGRN, which will hopefully lead to additional therapeutic targets. Additionally, drug screens have been conducted to identify pharmacological regulators of PGRN levels to be used as potential treatments for PGRN haploinsufficiency. Here we review recent literature describing relevant data on GRN genetics, cell culture experiments describing the potential role and regulators of PGRN in the central nervous system, animal models of PGRN deficiency, and potential PGRN-related FTLD therapies that are currently underway. The present review aims to underscore the necessity of further elucidation of PGRN biology in FTLD-related neurodegeneration."

Signal intensity and duration have been recognized as crucial parameters determining MAPK signaling output. Phosphatases play a particularly important role in this respect, by tightly controlling MAPK phosphorylation and activation. M3/6 (DUSP8) is a dual-specificity phosphatase implicated in the dephosphorylation and inactivation of JNK and, to a lesser extent, p38 MAPKs and is found in a complex with these kinases, along with other pathway components, held together by scaffold proteins. The JNK family consists of three genes, giving rise to at least ten different splice variants. Some functional differences between these gene products have been demonstrated, but the underlying molecular mechanisms and the roles of individual splice variants are still incompletely understood. We have investigated the interaction of M3/6 with JNK isoforms, as well as scaffold proteins of the JNK interacting protein (JIP) family, in order to elucidate the contribution of M3/6 to the regulation of distinct JNK signaling modules. M3/6 exhibited stronger binding towards JNK1beta and JNK2alpha isoforms and this was reflected in higher enzymatic activity towards JNK2alpha2 when compared to JNK1alpha1 in vitro. After activation of the pathway by exposure of cells to arsenite, the interaction of M3/6 with JNK1alpha and JNK3 was enhanced, whereas that with JNK1beta or JNK2alpha decreased. The modulation of binding affinities was found to be independent of JNK-mediated M3/6 phosphorylation. Furthermore, arsenite treatment resulted in an inducible recruitment of M3/6 to JNK-interacting protein 3 (JIP3) scaffold complexes, while its interaction with JIP1 or JIP2 was constitutive. The presented data suggest an isoform-specific role for the M3/6 phosphatase and the dynamic targeting of M3/6 towards distinct JNK-containing signaling complexes."

Besides tight transcriptional control from multiple distinct promoters, alternative 3'end processing of the BDNF transcripts generates either a long or a short 3'untranslated region (3'UTR). Previous reports indicate that distinct RNA sequence in the BDNF 3'UTRs differentially regulates BDNF production in the brain to accommodate neuronal activity changes, conceivably through differential interactions with undefined trans-acting factors that regulate stability and translation of these BDNF mRNA isoforms. In this study, we report that the neuronal RNA-binding protein (RBP) HuD interacts with a highly conserved AU-rich element (ARE) specifically located in the BDNF long 3'UTR. Such interaction is necessary and sufficient for selective stabilization of mRNAs that contain the BDNF long 3'UTR in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, in a HuD transgenic mouse model, the BDNF long 3'UTR mRNA is increased in the hippocampal dentate granule cells (DGCs), leading to elevated expression of BDNF protein that is transported and stored in the mossy fiber (MF) terminals. Our results identify HuD as the first trans-acting factor that enhances BDNF expression specifically through the long 3'UTR and a novel mechanism that regulates BDNF protein production in selected neuronal populations by HuD abundance."

PPROM results in critical care emergencies, and nearly all PPROM events are spontaneous and unpredictable. In addition, changes in the proteome in placental tissue during pregnancy that lead to PPROM are not clear. METHODS: We utilize a proteomics approach to study the molecular mechanisms behind human PPROM. A better understanding of proteome alteration could lead to the identification of better diagnostic/prognostic markers. Human placental tissue was collected in clearly differentiated cases of PPROM and in a healthy term control. Two-dimensional gel polyacrylamide electrophoresis coupled with mass spectrometry and bioinformatics analysis was utilized to identify proteins with altered expression. RESULTS: In this study, only the most important protein differences were selected for further analysis. Most of the identified proteins were structural/cytoskeletal components of the cell or involved in the regulation of energy metabolism and oxidative stress. CONCLUSIONS: As a result, this approach has led to the identification of several proteins involved in the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms that can further serve as novel diagnostic tools and targets for rational drug intervention."

It can also contribute to the aggravation of heart failure and sudden cardiac death. Redox stress and Ca(2+) overload are thought to be the important triggering factors in the generation of arrhythmias in failing myocardium. From recent studies, it appears evident that Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) plays a central role in the arrhythmogenic processes in heart failure by sensing intracellular Ca(2+) and redox stress, affecting individual ion channels and thereby leading to electrical instability in the heart. CaMKII, a multifunctional serine/threonine kinase, is an abundant molecule in the neuron and the heart. It has a specific property as \"a memory molecule\" such that the binding of calcified calmodulin (Ca(2+)/CaM) to the regulatory domain on CaMKII initially activates this enzyme. Further, it allows autophosphorylation of T287 or oxidation of M281/282 in the regulatory domain, resulting in sustained activation of CaMKII even after the dissociation of Ca(2+)/CaM. This review provides the understanding of both the structural and functional properties of CaMKII, the experimental findings of the interactions between CaMKII, redox stress and individual ion channels, and the evidences proving the potential participation of CaMKII and oxidative stress in the diverse arrhythmogenic processes in a diseased heart."

DESIGN: Population based cohort study with time to event analyses to estimate the relation between use of particular statins and incident diabetes. Hazard ratios were calculated to determine the effect of dose and type of statin on the risk of incident diabetes. SETTING: Ontario, Canada. PARTICIPANTS: All patients aged 66 or older without diabetes who started treatment with statins from 1 August 1997 to 31 March 2010. The analysis was restricted to new users who had not been prescribed a statin in at least the preceding year. Patients with established diabetes before the start of treatment were excluded. INTERVENTIONS: Treatment with statins. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Incident diabetes. RESULTS: Compared with pravastatin (the reference drug in all analyses), there was an increased risk of incident diabetes with atorvastatin (adjusted hazard ratio 1.22, 95% confidence interval 1.15 to 1.29), rosuvastatin (1.18, 1.10 to 1.26), and simvastatin (1.10, 1.04 to 1.17). There was no significantly increased risk among people who received fluvastatin (0.95, 0.81 to 1.11) or lovastatin (0.99, 0.86 to 1.14). The absolute risk for incident diabetes was about 31 and 34 events per 1000 person years for atorvastatin and rosuvastatin, respectively. There was a slightly higher [corrected] absolute risk with simvastatin (26 outcomes per 1000 person years) compared with pravastatin (23 outcomes per 1000 person years). Our findings were consistent regardless of whether statins were used for primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Although similar results were observed when statins were grouped by potency, the risk of incident diabetes associated with use of rosuvastatin became non-significant (adjusted hazard ratio 1.01, 0.94 to 1.09) when dose was taken into account. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with pravastatin, treatment with higher potency statins, especially atorvastatin and simvastatin, might be associated with an increased risk of new onset diabetes."

We aimed to assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of bilateral, intrastriatal delivery of ProSavin, a lentiviral vector-based gene therapy aimed at restoring local and continuous dopamine production in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease. METHODS: We undertook a phase 1/2 open-label trial with 12-month follow-up at two study sites (France and UK) to assess the safety and efficacy of ProSavin after bilateral injection into the putamen of patients with Parkinson's disease. All patients were then enrolled in a separate open-label follow-up study of long-term safety. Three doses were assessed in separate cohorts: low dose (1 9x10(7) transducing units [TU]); mid dose (4 0x10(7) TU); and high dose (1x10(8) TU). Inclusion criteria were age 48-65 years, disease duration 5 years or longer, motor fluctuations, and 50% or higher motor response to oral dopaminergic therapy. The primary endpoints of the phase 1/2 study were the number and severity of adverse events associated with ProSavin and motor responses as assessed with Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) part III (off medication) scores, at 6 months after vector administration. Both trials are registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00627588 and NCT01856439. FINDINGS: 15 patients received ProSavin and were followed up (three at low dose, six mid dose, six high dose). During the first 12 months of follow-up, 54 drug-related adverse events were reported (51 mild, three moderate). Most common were increased on-medication dyskinesias (20 events, 11 patients) and on-off phenomena (12 events, nine patients). No serious adverse events related to the study drug or surgical procedure were reported. A significant improvement in mean UPDRS part III motor scores off medication was recorded in all patients at 6 months (mean score 38 [SD 9] vs 26 [8], n=15, p=0 0001) and 12 months (38 vs 27 [8]; n=15, p=0 0001) compared with baseline. INTERPRETATION: ProSavin was safe and well tolerated in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease. Improvement in motor behaviour was observed in all patients. FUNDING: Oxford BioMedica."

METHODS: A retrospective study of patients with TTTS treated with laser surgery was performed. Membrane separation before and after surgery was tested against any PPROM, PPROM within 7 days, and PPROM within 21 days. Because intrauterine fetal demise (IUFD) was weakly associated with PPROM, these cases were studied separately. RESULTS: Among 304 consecutive patients, 247 patients (81.3%) had no IUFD, and preoperative and postoperative membrane separation rates were 13.4% and 13.0%, respectively. In 7 cases (2.8%), preoperative membrane separation disappeared postoperatively, and in 6 cases (2.4%), membrane separation appeared postoperatively; 26 cases (10.5%) had membrane separation at both times. Rates of PPROM did not differ between those who did and did not have preoperative membrane separation (30.3% versus 28.0%; P= .9511). Among those with and without postoperative membrane separation, the rates of any PPROM were 34.4% and 27.4%, respectively (P = .5473), and the rates of PPROM within 21 days were 15.6% and 5.6% (P = .0524). Those with postoperative membrane separation were 3 times more likely to have PPROM within 21 days (odds ratio, 3.13; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-9.58; P= .0453). Preterm premature rupture of membranes was not associated with preoperative or postoperative membrane separation in patients with IUFD. CONCLUSIONS: The preoperative moon sign does not appear to be associated with PPROM in TTTS. Postoperatively, membrane separation may be weakly associated with PPROM at 21 days, but further research is required to confirm this association."

We showed that expression of BCR-ABL1 correlates with decreased level of BRCA1 protein, which promoted aberrant mitoses and aneuploidy as well as altered DNA damage response. Using polysome profiling and luciferase-BRCA1 3'UTR reporter system here we demonstrate that downregulation of BRCA1 protein in CML is caused by inhibition of BRCA1 mRNA translation, but not by increased protein degradation or reduction of mRNA level and half-life. We investigated 2 mRNA-binding proteins - HuR and TIAR showing specificity to AU-Rich Element (ARE) sites in 3'UTR of mRNA. BCR-ABL1 promoted cytosolic localization of TIAR and HuR, their binding to BRCA1 mRNA and formation of the TIAR-HuR complex. HuR protein positively regulated BRCA1 mRNA stability and translation, conversely TIAR negatively regulated BRCA1 translation and was found localized predominantly in the cytosolic stress granules in CML cells. TIAR-dependent downregulation of BRCA1 protein level was a result of ER stress, which is activated in BCR-ABL1 expressing cells, as we previously shown. Silencing of TIAR in CML cells strongly elevated BRCA1 level. Altogether, we determined that TIAR-mediated repression of BRCA1 mRNA translation is responsible for downregulation of BRCA1 protein level in BCR-ABL1 -positive leukemia cells. This mechanism may contribute to genomic instability and provide justification for targeting PARP1 and/or RAD52 to induce synthetic lethality in \"BRCAness\" CML and BCR-ABL1 -positive ALL cells."

Modeling of human PRDM12 mutations that cause hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy (HSAN) revealed remarkable conservation of the mutated residues in evolution. Expression of wild-type human PRDM12 in Xenopus induced the expression of sensory neuronal markers, which was reduced using various human PRDM12 mutants.

Defects in NHEJ have been shown to contribute to genomic instability and have been associated with the development of chemoresistance.Experimental Design: NHEJ was assessed in a panel of ovarian cancer cell lines and 47 primary ascetic-derived ovarian cancer cultures, by measuring the ability of cell extracts to end-join linearized plasmid monomers into multimers. mRNA and protein expression of components of NHEJ was determined using RT-qPCR and Western blotting. Cytotoxicities of cisplatin and the PARP inhibitor rucaparib were assessed using sulforhodamine B (SRB) assays.

In addition, we report microfractures in fetal membranes that are likely sites of tissue remodeling during gestation; however, increase in number and morphometry (width and depth) of these microfractures in pPROM membranes suggests reduced remodeling capacity of membranes. Microfractures can act as channels for amniotic fluid leak, and inflammatory cell and microbial migration.

In this study, we diagnosed ten NS or NSML patients via targeted sequencing or whole exome sequencing (TS/WES). METHODS: TS/WES was performed to identify mutations in ten Chinese patients who exhibited the following manifestations: potential facial dysmorphisms, short stature, congenital heart defects, and developmental delay. Sanger sequencing was used to confirm the suspected pathological variants in the patients and their family members. RESULTS: TS/WES revealed three mutations in the PTPN11 gene, three mutations in RAF1 gene, and four mutations in BRAF gene in the NS and NSML patients who were previously diagnosed based on the abovementioned clinical features. All the identified mutations were determined to be de novo mutations. However, two patients who carried the same mutation in the RAF1 gene presented different clinical features. One patient with multiple lentigines was diagnosed with NSML, while the other patient without lentigines was diagnosed with NS. In addition, a patient who carried a hotspot mutation in the BRAF gene was diagnosed with NS instead of cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome (CFCS). CONCLUSIONS: TS/WES has emerged as a useful tool for definitive diagnosis and accurate genetic counseling of atypical cases. In this study, we analyzed ten Chinese patients diagnosed with NS and related disorders and identified their correspondingPTPN11, RAF1, and BRAF mutations. Among the target genes, BRAF showed the same degree of correlation with NS incidence as that of PTPN11 or RAF1."

However, it is unclear whether the active changes mediated by variations in DNA methyltransferase activity are heritable. Here, we established human-derived DNMT3A (hDNMT3A) transgenic rats to study the effect of hDNMT3A overexpression on the DNA methylation pattern of rat sperm and to investigate whether this actively altered DNA methylation status is inheritable. Our results revealed that hDNMT3A was overexpressed in the testis of transgenic rats and induced genome-wide alterations in the DNA methylation pattern of rat sperm. Among 5438 reliable loci identified with 64 primer-pair combinations using a methylation-sensitive amplification polymorphism method, 28.01% showed altered amplified band types. Among these amplicons altered loci, 68.42% showed an altered DNA methylation status in the offspring of transgenic rats compared with wild-type rats. Further analysis based on loci which had identical DNA methylation status in all three biological replicates revealed that overexpression of hDNMT3A in paternal testis induced hypermethylation in sperm of both genotype-negative and genotype-positive offspring. Among the differentially methylated loci, 34.26% occurred in both positive and negative offspring of transgenic rats, indicating intergenerational inheritance of active DNA methylation changes in the absence of hDNM3A transmission. Furthermore, 75.07% of the inheritable loci were hyper-methylated while the remaining were hypomethylated. Distribution analysis revealed that the DNA methylation variations mainly occurred in introns and intergenic regions. Functional analysis revealed that genes related to differentially methylated loci were involved in a wide range of functions. Finally, this study demonstrated that active DNA methylation changes induced by hDNMT3A expression were intergenerationally inherited by offspring without transmission of the transgene, which provided evidence for the transmission of active endogenous-factors-induced epigenetic variations."

Traditional treatment options, such as unilateral ventriculoperitoneal (VP) or lumboperitoneal (LP) shunt placement, have high complication and failure rates and often require multiple revisions. The use of bilateral proximal catheters has been hypothesized as a method to improve shunt survival. The use of stereotactic technology has improved the accuracy of catheter placement and may improve treatment of IIH, with fewer complications and greater shunt patency time. METHODS The authors performed a retrospective chart review for all patients with IIH who underwent stereotactic placement of biventriculoperitoneal (BVP) shunt catheters from 2008 to 2016 at their institution. Bilateral proximal catheters were Y-connected to a Strata valve with a single distal catheter. We evaluated clinical, surgical, and ophthalmological variables and outcomes. RESULTS Most patients in this series of 34 patients (mean age 34.4 +- 8.2 years, mean body mass index 38.7 +- 8.3 kg/m2; 91.2% were women) undergoing 41 shunt procedures presented with headache (94.1%) and visual deficits (85.3%). The mean opening pressure was 39.6 +- 9.0 cm H2O. In addition, 50.0% had undergone previous unilateral shunt placement, and 20.6% had undergone prior optic nerve sheath fenestration. After BVP shunt placement, there were no cases of proximal catheter obstruction and only a single case of valve obstruction at 41.9 months, with a mean follow-up of 24.8 +- 20.0 months. Most patients showed improvement in their headache (82.4%), subjective vision (70.6%), and papilledema (61.5% preoperatively vs 20.0% postoperatively, p = 0.02) at follow-up. Additional primary complications included 4 patients with migration of their distal catheters out of the peritoneum (twice in 1 patient), and an infection of the distal catheter after catheter dislodgment. The proximal obstructive shunt complication rate in this series (2.9%) was lower than that with LP (53.5%) or unilateral VP (37.8%) shunts seen in the literature. CONCLUSIONS This small series suggests that stereotactic placement of BVP shunt catheters appears to improve shunt survival rates and presenting symptoms in patients with IIH. Compared with unilateral VP or LP shunts, the use of BVP shunts may be a more effective and more functionally sustained method for the treatment of IIH."

On August 30, 2017, the FDA approved tisagenlecleucel for treatment of patients up to 25 years of age with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) that is refractory in second or later relapse. Approval was based on the complete remission (CR) rate, durability of CR, and minimal residual disease (MRD) <0.01% in a cohort of 63 children and young adults with relapsed or refractory ALL treated on a single-arm trial (CCTL019B2202). Treatment consisted of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide followed 2 to 14 days later by a single dose of tisagenlecleucel. The CR rate was 63% (95% confidence interval, 50%-75%), and all CRs had MRD <0.01%. With a median follow-up of 4.8 months, the median duration of response was not reached. Cytokine release syndrome (79%) and neurologic events (65%) were serious toxicities reported in the trial. With implementation of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, the benefit-risk profile was considered acceptable for this patient population with such resistant ALL. A study of safety with 15 years of follow-up is required as a condition of the approval.See related commentary by Geyer, p. 1133."

GRN mutations create null alleles resulting in decreased progranulin protein or haploinsufficiency. FTLD-TDP with GRN mutations is characterized by lentiform neuronal intranuclear inclusions that are positive for TDP-43 in affected brain regions. In this study, by stably expressed short hairpin RNA, we established a neuroblastoma cell line with decreased PGRN level. This cell line reveals TDP-43-positive intranuclear inclusions. In addition, replacement with purified PGRN protein restores normal TDP-43 nuclear distribution. This cell model can be valuable for the study of the role of PGRN in the pathogenesis in FTLD-TDP."

OBJECTIVE: To better characterize the natural history of the most common SCAs, SCA1, SCA2, SCA3 and SCA6, we performed a meta-analysis of literature to determine disease progression, provide data for sample-sizes calculations for interventional trials and study the impact of geographical locations and study follow-up on disease progression. METHODS: A systematic literature search from MEDLINE and EMBASE databases for longitudinal natural history studies of SCA patients was conducted. Studies using the Scale for the Assessment and Rating Ataxia (SARA) as outcome measure were considered. Random-effect (RE) meta-analysis was applied to estimate pooled disease progression. RESULTS: Six studies with 1215 SCA patients enrolled between 2005 and 2016 were finally selected. Annual pooled SARA score increase was 1.83 (1.46-2.20) in patients with SCA1, 1.40 (1.19-1.61) in patients with SCA2, 1.41 (0.97-1.84) in patients with SCA3, and 0.81 (0.66-0.97) in patients with SCA6. For patients with SCA3, disease progression was faster in studies located in Asia and Europe than in the US. Two-arm interventional trials of 1-year duration to achieve 80% power and alpha level of 5% would require 92 patients per group with SCA1, 97 with SCA2, 115 with SCA3, and 430 with SCA6 to detect a 50% reduction in disease progression. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis provides quantitative data on the progression of the most common spinocerebellar ataxias based on patient numbers that exceed those of previous studies and confirms that disease progression is faster in SCA1, intermediate in SCA2 and SCA3 and slower in SCA6, with similar rates of disease progression in SCA2 and SCA3 between different populations, suggesting a possibility of international collaborative studies. Nevertheless, individual-patient data meta-analysis is needed to better understand the risk factors that influence disease progression and improve patient stratification in interventional trials."

Here, key experiments that have informed the understanding of heredity are reinterpreted to highlight this distortion and the possible variety of heritable changes are considered. Unlike heritable genetic changes, which are always associated with mutations in gene sequence, heritable epigenetic changes can be associated with physical or chemical changes in molecules or only changes in the system. The transmission of cycling stores along the continuous lineage of cells that connects successive generations creates waves of activity and localization of the molecules that together form the cell code for development in each generation. As a result, heritable epigenetic changes can include any that can alter a wave such as changes in form, midline, frequency, amplitude, or phase. Testing this integrated view of all heritable information will require the concerted application of multiple experimental approaches across generations."

Early reports describe high venous thromboembolism (VTE) and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) rates, but data are limited. This multicenter retrospective study describes the rate and severity of hemostatic and thrombotic complications of 400 hospital-admitted COVID-19 patients (144 critically ill) primarily receiving standard-dose prophylactic anticoagulation. Coagulation and inflammatory parameters were compared between patients with and without coagulation-associated complications. Multivariable logistic models examined the utility of these markers in predicting coagulation-associated complications, critical illness, and death. The radiographically confirmed VTE rate was 4.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.9-7.3), and the overall thrombotic complication rate was 9.5% (95% CI, 6.8-12.8). The overall and major bleeding rates were 4.8% (95% CI, 2.9-7.3) and 2.3% (95% CI, 1.0-4.2), respectively. In the critically ill, radiographically confirmed VTE and major bleeding rates were 7.6% (95% CI, 3.9-13.3) and 5.6% (95% CI, 2.4-10.7), respectively. Elevated D-dimer at initial presentation was predictive of coagulation-associated complications during hospitalization (D-dimer >2500 ng/mL, adjusted odds ratio [OR] for thrombosis, 6.79 [95% CI, 2.39-19.30]; adjusted OR for bleeding, 3.56 [95% CI, 1.01-12.66]), critical illness, and death. Additional markers at initial presentation predictive of thrombosis during hospitalization included platelet count >450 x 109/L (adjusted OR, 3.56 [95% CI, 1.27-9.97]), C-reactive protein (CRP) >100 mg/L (adjusted OR, 2.71 [95% CI, 1.26-5.86]), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) >40 mm/h (adjusted OR, 2.64 [95% CI, 1.07-6.51]). ESR, CRP, fibrinogen, ferritin, and procalcitonin were higher in patients with thrombotic complications than in those without. DIC, clinically relevant thrombocytopenia, and reduced fibrinogen were rare and were associated with significant bleeding manifestations. Given the observed bleeding rates, randomized trials are needed to determine any potential benefit of intensified anticoagulant prophylaxis in COVID-19 patients."

The reported incidence of IMH among all type A acute aortic syndromes ranges from 3.5% to 28.3%. As compared with acute aortic dissection, IMH is a disease of the elderly, and it tends to have reduced rates of malperfusion syndromes, aortic insufficiency, and root dilation, yet also tends to have increased rates of pericardial effusion, cardiac tamponade, and periaortic hematoma. With respect to natural history, IMH may progress to classic dissection, frank rupture, or aneurysmal dilation; yet, IMH may also regress and be completely resorbed. However, studies disagree over the rates of progression or regression; as such, few studies agree on the short-term and long-term prognosis associated with IMH. American and European guidelines advocate emergent surgery for all acutely presenting type A IMH. At a minimum, supracoronary replacement of the aorta with hemiarch reconstruction is the preferred extent of operative repair to reduce rates of long-term reintervention for disease progression. However, valve and/or root procedures may be necessary proximally, while total arch reconstruction or hybrid procedures for the descending aorta may be necessary distally. Much remains unknown for IMH, including the ideal extent of aortic repair, risk-stratification for elderly patients, and the optimal treatment paradigm for stable, uncomplicated IMH. As such, IMH remains a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge for the cardiovascular surgeon."

Typically, DMD patients pass away from heart failure or respiratory failure. Currently, there is no cure, though exon-skipping therapy including eteplirsen (brand name Exondys 51), a synthetic antisense oligonucleotide designed to skip exon 51 of the dystrophin gene, is considered especially promising. Applicable to approximately 14% of DMD patients, a phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (PMO) antisense oligonucleotide eteplirsen received accelerated approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2016. Throughout clinical trials, eteplirsen has been well tolerated by patients with no serious drug-related adverse events. The most common events observed are balance disorder, vomiting, and skin rash. Despite its safety and promise of functional benefits, eteplirsen remains controversial due to its low production of dystrophin. In addition, unmodified PMOs have limited efficacy in the heart. To address these concerns of efficacy, eteplirsen has been conjugated to a proprietary cell-penetrating peptide; the conjugate is called SRP-5051. Compared to eteplirsen, SRP-5051 aims to better prompt exon-skipping and dystrophin production but may have greater toxicity concerns. This paper reviews and discusses the available information on the efficacy, safety, and tolerability data of eteplirsen and SRP-5051 from preclinical and clinical trials. Issues faced by eteplirsen and SRP-5051, including efficacy and safety, are identified. Lastly, the current state of eteplirsen and exon-skipping therapy in general as a strategy for the treatment of DMD are discussed."

Yet, despite having far greater diversity (e.g., gene number, distribution, modes of expression), eukaryotic cells employ individual promoters and monocistronic messages. Although gene expression is modular, it does not account for how eukaryotes achieve coordinated localized translation. The RNA operon theory states that mRNAs derived from different chromosomes assemble into ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs) that act as functional operons to generate protein cohorts upon cotranslation. Work in yeast has now validated this theory and shown that intergenic associations and noncanonical histone functions create pathway-specific RNA operons (transperons) that regulate cell physiology.

TTP is found after various bacterial or viral infectious diseases, autoimmune diseases and also in association with different drugs. PATHOGENESIS: After initial endothelial cell injury unusually large von Willebrand factors (vWF) are found in plasma of patients with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Because of impaired proteolysis these large forms lead to thrombosis of the small vessels. The microangiopathy is followed by mechanical destruction of red cells. In peripheral blood smears these fragmentocytes are important for diagnosis and clinical course. THERAPY: The therapy of choice is plasma exchange against fresh frozen plasma, whereupon the mortality could be dramatically reduced in the past decades. In case of treatment resistance to plasma exchange there exists no common treatment schedule. One therapy option is immunosuppressive treatment with corticosteroids and vincristine. In case of chronic relapsing TTP splenectomy should be discussed. In spite of severe thrombocytopenia substitution of thrombocytes is contraindicated."

Although no obvious disease-causing mutations were identified in the CASQ2 gene, the molecular screening revealed two novel amino-acid polymorphisms (T66A and V76M). The frequencies of these polymorphisms in 185 unrelated probands with long QT syndrome and in 280 healthy blood donors were not significantly different. These data, combined with our previous findings, show that RYR2 mutations are present in at least 6/16 (38%) of the catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia families, while CASQ2 mutations must be a rare cause of CPVT."

We present here the development of a differentiation system using ES-like cell lines from medaka. These cells were transfected with the melanocyte specific isoform of the microphtalmia-related transcription factor (Mitf). Mitf is a basic helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper transcription factor whose M isoform is restricted to neural crest derived melanocytes and is essential for the development of these cells in vertebrates from mammals to fish. What is not clear yet is whether Mitf is a downstream factor or a master regulator of melanocyte commitment and differentiation. Expression of Mitf in the ES-like cells from medaka led to the induction of cells that, by morphology, physiology and gene expression pattern, were confirmed to be fully differentiated pigment cells. Mitf expression is therefore sufficient for the proper differentiation of medaka pluripotent stem cells into melanocytes."

For locally advanced disease, radiation is combined with low-dose chemotherapy; however, this modality often leads to severe toxicity. Curcumin, a polyphenol extracted from rhizomes of the plant Curcuma longa, is a widely studied chemopreventive agent that was shown to have a low toxicity profile in three human clinical trials. Here, we show that pretreatment of two cervical carcinoma cell lines, HeLa and SiHa, with curcumin before ionizing radiation (IR) resulted in significant dose-dependent radiosensitization of these cells. It is noteworthy that curcumin failed to radiosensitize normal human diploid fibroblasts. Although in tumor cells, curcumin did not significantly affect IR-induced activation of AKT and nuclear factor-kappaB, we found that it caused a significant increase in the production of reactive oxygen species, which further led to sustained extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 activation. The antioxidant compound N-acetylcysteine blocked the curcumin-induced increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), sustained activation of ERK1/2, and decreased survival after IR in HeLa cells, implicating a ROS-dependent mechanism for curcumin radiosensitivity. Moreover, PD98059 (2'-amino-3'-methoxyflavone)-, PD184352- [2-(2-chloro-4-iodo-phenylamino)-N-cyclopropylmethoxy-3,4-difluoro-benzamide], and U0126 [1,4-diamino-2,3-dicyano-1,4-bis(2-aminophynylthio)butadiene]-specific inhibitors of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1/2 (MEK1/2) blocked curcumin-mediated radiosensitization, demonstrating that the sustained ERK1/2 activation resulting from ROS generation leads to curcumin-mediated radiosensitization. Together, these results suggest a novel mechanism for curcumin-mediated radiosensitization involving increased ROS and ERK1/2 activation and suggest that curcumin application (either systemically or topically) may be an effective radiation modifying modality in the treatment of cervical cancer."

        "text": "Tousled kinase TLK1B mediates chromatin assembly in conjunction with Asf1 regardless of its kinase activity.\nBACKGROUND: The Tousled Like Kinases (TLKs) are involved in chromatin dynamics, including DNA replication and repair, transcription, and chromosome segregation. Indeed, the first two TLK1 substrates were identified as the histone H3 and Asf1 (a histone H3/H4 chaperone), which immediately suggested a function in chromatin remodeling. However, despite the straightforward assumption that TLK1 acts simply by phosphorylating its substrates and hence modifying their activity, TLK1 also acts as a chaperone. In fact, a kinase-dead (KD) mutant of TLK1B is functional in stimulating chromatin assembly in vitro. However, subtle effects of Asf1 phosphorylation are more difficult to probe in chromatin assembly assays. Not until very recently was the Asf1 site phosphorylated by TLK1 identified. This has allowed for probing directly the functionality of a site-directed mutant of Asf1 in chromatin assembly assays. FINDINGS: Addition of either wt or non-phosphorylatable mutant Asf1 to nuclear extract stimulates chromatin assembly on a plasmid. Similarly, TLK1B-KD stimulates chromatin assembly and it synergizes in reactions with supplemental Asf1 (wt or non-phosphorylatable mutant). CONCLUSIONS: Although the actual function of TLKs as mediators of Asf1 activity cannot be easily studied in vivo, particularly since in mammalian cells there are two TLK genes and two Asf1 genes, we were able to study specifically the stimulation of chromatin assembly in vitro. In such assays, clearly the TLK1 kinase activity was not critical, as neither a non-phosphorylatable Asf1 nor use of the TLK1B-KD impaired the stimulation of nucleosome formation."

An observational study of renal function in patients with Bartter or Gitelman syndrome.\nBACKGROUND: Hypokalaemic nephropathy has been described in patients with chronic potassium depletion; it is a condition in which proximal tubular vacuolization and interstitial fibrosis occur, resulting in a decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and, in some cases, renal failure. It has been described in patients with chronic diarrhoea, eating disorders, laxative abuse and primary hyperaldosteronism; also occasionally in Bartter syndrome (BS), in which severe hypokalaemia accompanies significant renal sodium and water losses, though rarely in Gitelman syndrome (GS), in which there is equally severe hypokalaemia, but only modest sodium losses. AIM: We hypothesized that hypokalaemic nephropathy may not be due to potassium depletion per se, but persistently elevated circulating levels of aldosterone, possibly with superimposed episodes of renal hypoperfusion. DESIGN AND METHODS: We searched UK and European data sets to retrospectively compare serum and urinary parameters in patients with GS and BS. RESULTS: The patients with GS often had lower serum potassium concentrations than patients with BS, but the BS patients had significantly higher serum creatinine concentrations and lower estimated GFRs (eGFR). BS patients had significantly higher fractional excretions of sodium compared with GS patients, as well as higher plasma renin activities and serum aldosterone levels. CONCLUSION: These findings show that in genetically confirmed cases of BS and GS, the degree of hypokalaemia (as an index of chronic potassium depletion) does not correlate with GFR, and that on-going sodium and water losses, and consequent secondary hyperaldosteronism, may play a more important role in the aetiology of hypokalaemic nephropathy."

TM residues fall into two major structural classes (alpha-helix membrane protein and beta-barrel membrane protein). The reported solvent ASA prediction models were developed for these two types of TM residues respectively. However, this prevents the general use of these methods because one cannot determine which model is suitable for a given TM residue without information of its type. To conquer this limitation, we developed a new computational model that can be used for predicting the ASA of both TM alpha-helix and beta-barrel residues. The model was developed from 78 alpha-helix membrane protein chains and 24 beta-barrel membrane protein. Its prediction ability was evaluated by cross validation method and its prediction result on an independent test set of 20 membrane protein chains. The results show that our model performs well for both types of TM residues and outperforms other prediction model which was developed for the specific type of TM residues. The prediction results also proved that the random forest model incorporating conservation score is an effective sequence-based computational approach for predicting the solvent ASA of TM residues."

Using this system, we performed a systematic analysis of whether during transdifferentiation the cells transiently reactivate progenitor-restricted genes or even retrodifferentiate. A transcriptome analysis of transdifferentiating cells showed that most genes are up- or down-regulated continuously, acquiring a macrophage phenotype within 5 d. In addition, we observed the transient reactivation of a subset of immature myeloid markers, as well as low levels of the progenitor markers Kit and FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 and a few lineage-inappropriate genes. Importantly, however, we were unable to observe the reexpression of cell-surface marker combinations that characterize hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, including c-Kit and FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3, even when CAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha was activated in pre-B cells under culture conditions that favor growth of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells or when the transcription factor was activated in a time-limited fashion.

Previously, we found that human sperm tails contain trophinin, bystin and tastin proteins, and that trophinin-binding GWRQ (glycine, tryptophan, arginine, glutamine) peptide enhanced motility of human sperm. METHODS: Immunohistochemistry was employed to determine trophinin protein in mouse spermatozoa from wild type mouse, by using spermatozoa from trophinin null mutant mice as a negative control. Multivalent 8-branched GWRQ (glycine, tryptophan, arginine, glutamine) peptide or GWRQ-MAPS, was chemically synthesized, purified by HPLC and its structure was confirmed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Effect of GWRQ-MAPS on mouse spermatozoa from wild type and trophinin null mutant was assessed by a computer-assisted semen analyzer (CASA). RESULTS: Anti-trophinin antibody stained the principal (central) piece of the tail of wild type mouse sperm, whereas the antibody showed no staining on trophinin null sperm. Phage particles displaying GWRQ bound to the principal piece of sperm tail from wild type but not trophinin null mice. GWRQ-MAPS enhanced motility of spermatozoa from wild type but not trophinin null mice. CASA showed that GWRQ-MAPS enhanced both progressive motility and rapid motility in wild type mouse sperm. CONCLUSIONS: Present study established the expression of trophinin in the mouse sperm tail and trophinin-dependent effect of GWRQ-MAPS on sperm motility.

However, demonstration and quantification of functional IP in HF cells are required. We examined the middle (sheath) and lower (bulb) portions of the human HF using quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qPCR), immunohistology, ELISA, in vitro coculture with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and flow cytometry. We found that HF cells, relative to non-follicular epidermal cells, failed to promote allogeneic PBMC proliferation and CD4(+) and CD8(+) IFNgamma production. By qPCR, we found significant downregulation of Class I and Class II HLA alleles in both the bulb and sheath, and upregulation of multiple immunoregulatory genes. It is noteworthy that somatostatin (SST) was significantly upregulated relative to epidermis. By immunohistochemistry, SST was most strongly expressed in the HF outer root sheath, and, by ELISA, cultured sheath cells secreted SST. PBMCs, cultured with stimulatory allogeneic epidermal cells and SST, secreted significantly less IFNgamma than controls. Addition of SST antagonists to PBMCs cocultured with allogeneic HF cells increased IFNgamma secretion. The data identify SST as a secretory factor potentially contributing to the HF IP repertoire."

In this subanalysis, we investigated the safety and efficacy of rivaroxaban and warfarin in relation to patients' CHADS2 scores. RESULTS: The mean CHADS2 score was 3.25, and the most frequent scores were 3 and 4. No statistically significant interactions were observed between principal safety outcome event rates and CHADS2 scores with respect to treatment groups (P value for interaction = .700). Irrespective of stratification into moderate- and high-risk groups based on CHADS2 scores of 2 and 3 or more, respectively, no differences in principal safety outcome event rates were observed between rivaroxaban- and warfarin-treated patients (moderate-risk group: hazard ratio [HR], 1.06; 95% confidence interval [CI], .58-1.95; high-risk group: HR, 1.11; 95% CI, .86-1.45; P value for interaction = .488).

In this study, we assessed how oxidative stress affects the potency of ADP as an mPTP inhibitor and whether its reduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production might be involved. We determined quantitatively the effects of ADP on mitochondrial Ca(2+) retention capacity (CRC) until the induction of mPTP in normal and stressed isolated cardiac mitochondria. We used two models of chronic oxidative stress (old and diabetic mice) and two models of acute oxidative stress (ischemia reperfusion (IR) and tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BH)). In control mitochondria, the CRC was 344 +- 32 nmol/mg protein. 500 mumol/L ADP increased CRC to 774 +- 65 nmol/mg protein. This effect of ADP seemed to relate to its concentration as 50 mumol/L had a significantly smaller effect. Also, oligomycin, which inhibits the conversion of ADP to ATP by F0F1ATPase, significantly increased the effect of 50 mumol/L ADP. Chronic oxidative stress did not affect CRC or the effect of 500 mumol/L ADP. After IR or t-BH exposure, CRC was drastically reduced to 1 +- 0.2 and 32 +- 4 nmol/mg protein, respectively. Surprisingly, ADP increased the CRC to 447 +- 105 and 514 +- 103 nmol/mg protein in IR and t-BH, respectively. Thus, it increased CRC by the same amount as in control. In control mitochondria, ADP decreased both substrate and Ca(2+)-induced increase of ROS. However, in t-BH mitochondria the effect of ADP on ROS was relatively small. We conclude that ADP potently restores CRC capacity in severely stressed mitochondria. This effect is most likely not related to a reduction in ROS production. As the effect of ADP relates to its concentration, increased ADP as occurs in the pathophysiological situation may protect mitochondrial integrity and function."

Beginning with studies of cyclosporin A in the 1980s, but with more activity in the past decade, there have been a number of clinical trials to test whether immunotherapies can arrest the decline in C-peptide, which is associated with progression of type 1 diabetes leading to the metabolic instability that characterizes the disease. One of the most promising agents, teplizumab , is an FcR-nonbinding anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody that has been tested in Phase II - III clinical trials and was shown to preserve the C-peptide levels and reduce the need for exogenous insulin. AREAS COVERED: In this review, we discuss the recent update on clinical data obtained from trials of teplizumab in type 1 diabetes, the drug's postulated mechanism of action and the identification of responders to therapy. We highlight the results of recent trials as well as the lessons that have been learned from the clinical trials involving selection of end points and the inclusion of diverse study populations. EXPERT OPINION: Teplizumab has been shown to preserve beta cell function in patients; however, it does not represent a 'cure' for patients, and its efficacy does entail a significant advance in arresting the progression of the disease toward complete insulin deficiency and reliance on exogenous insulin."

The European Society of Cardiology now recommends direct oral anticoagulants, such as rivaroxaban, apixaban, and dabigatran, in preference to vitamin K antagonist therapy for the prevention of stroke in patients with A F. This review focuses on the direct Factor Xa inhibitor rivaroxaban, summarizing the properties that make rivaroxaban appropriate for anticoagulant therapy in this indication (including its predictable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile and once-daily dosing regimen) and describing data from the Phase III ROCKET AF trial, which showed once-daily rivaroxaban to be noninferior to warfarin for the prevention of stroke in patients with nonvalvular AF. In this trial, similar rates of major and nonmajor clinically relevant bleeding were observed; however, when compared with warfarin, rivaroxaban was associated with clinically significant reductions in intracranial and fatal bleeding. On the basis of these results, rivaroxaban was approved in both the United States and the European Union for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular AF. Subanalyses of ROCKET AF data showed rivaroxaban to have consistent efficacy and safety across a wide range of patients, and studies to confirm these results in real-world settings are underway. This review also describes practical considerations for treatment with rivaroxaban in clinical practice (including dose reductions in specific high-risk patients, eg, those with renal impairment), recommendations for the transition from vitamin K antagonists to rivaroxaban, the management of bleeding events, and the measurement of rivaroxaban exposure.

The animals exhibited clinical symptoms of chronic botulism. To determine the source of the infection, feces, blood, organs, and gastrointestinal fluids of dead or euthanized cows; as well as soil, water, silage and manure were tested for C. botulinum spores and BoNTs using ELISA. BoNT/C and C. botulinum type C were detected in 53% and 3% of tested animals, respectively, while BoNT/D and C. botulinum type D were detected in 18% of the animals. C. botulinum also was detected in organs, gastrointestinal fluids, drinking water and manure. To evaluate possible treatments, animals were given Jerusalem artichoke syrup (JAS), Botulism vaccine (formalinised aluminum hydroxide gel adsorbed toxoid of C. botulinum types C and D) or a suspension of Enterococcus faecalis. After four weeks treatment with JAS, BoNT/C and C. botulinum type C were not detected in feces. In contrast, BoNT/D and C. botulinum type D were not significantly influenced by the JAS treatment. Vaccination with botulism vaccine and the E. faecalis suspension significantly decreased BoNT/D and C. botulinum type D. A significant increase of Enterococci was detected in animals treated with E. faecalis. Interestingly, there was a negative correlation between the detection of both BoNT and C. botulinum with the concentration of Enterococci in feces. Although C. botulinum C and D antibodies increased significantly (p < 0.0001) after vaccination with the botulism vaccine, the reduction of C. botulinum and BoNT in feces did not result in recovery of the animals because they were deficient of trace elements [manganese (Mn), cobalt (Co), copper (Cu) and selenium (Se)]. Animals treated with trace elements recovered. It appears that intestinal microbiota dysbiosis and trace element deficiency could explain the extensive emergence of chronic Botulism. "

Courses of therapy select for these mutants and drug-resistant organisms emerge. The development of drug-resistant organisms has reached the point that drug resistance now threatens to undermine global success against tuberculosis (TB). New drugs are needed. The last new class of drugs specifically developed for treatment of TB was the rifamycins over 40 years ago. New funding sources and the development of product development partnerships have energized the TB drug development effort. There are now more TB drugs in development than at any time in the past. The first of these drugs to be developed and marketed was bedaquiline. Bedaquiline has an entirely novel mechanism of action and so should be active against otherwise highly resistant organisms. It acts on the transmembrane component of adenosine triphosphate synthase and acts by preventing electron transport. This raises the exciting possibility that bedaquiline may be active against less metabolically active organisms. Drug-drug interactions between rifamycins and the cytochrome P450-3A system will limit bedaquiline's utility and create complexity in treatment regimens. In clinical trials, treatment with bedaquiline added to a background multidrug-resistant TB regimen was associated with earlier culture conversion and higher cure rates, but there were unexplained excess deaths in the bedaquiline arms of these trials. Food and Drug Administration approved bedaquiline for the treatment of multidrug-resistant TB when an effective treatment regimen cannot otherwise be provided. They required a black box warning about excess deaths and require that a phase III trial be completed. A planned Phase III trial is being reorganized. While bedaquiline is an exciting drug and marks a dramatic moment in the history of TB treatment, its ultimate place in the anti-TB drug armamentarium is unclear pending the Phase III trial and the development of other new drugs that are in the pipeline.

TPL2 (MAP3K8, COT) contributes to PRR-initiated pathways, yet the mechanisms for TPL2 signalling contributions in primary human myeloid cells are incompletely understood and its role in intestinal myeloid cells is poorly defined. Furthermore, functional consequences for the IBD-risk locus rs1042058 in TPL2 are unknown. METHODS: We analysed protein, cytokine and RNA expression, and signalling in human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) through western blot, ELISA, real-time PCR and flow cytometry. RESULTS: PRR-induced cytokine secretion was increased in MDMs from rs1042058 TPL2 GG risk individuals. TPL2 activation by the Crohn's disease-associated PRR nucleotide-oligomerisation domain (NOD)2 required PKC, and IKKbeta, IKKalpha and IKKgamma signalling. TPL2, in turn, significantly enhanced NOD2-induced ERK, JNK and NFkappaB signalling. We found that another major mechanism for the TPL2 contribution to NOD2 signalling was through ERK-dependent and JNK-dependent caspase-1 and caspase-8 activation, which in turn, led to early autocrine interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-18 secretion and amplification of long-term cytokines. Importantly, Salmonella typhimurium-induced cytokines from human intestinal myeloid-derived cells required TPL2 as well as autocrine IL-1beta and IL-18. Finally, rs1042058 GG risk carrier MDMs from healthy individuals and patients with Crohn's disease had increased TPL2 expression and NOD2-initiated TPL2 phosphorylation, ERK, JNK and NFkappaB activation, and early autocrine IL-1beta and IL-18 secretion. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, the rs1042058 GG IBD-risk polymorphism in TPL2 results in a gain-of-function by increasing TPL2 expression and signalling, thereby amplifying PRR-initiated outcomes."

Clinical diagnosis of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is difficult; however, it can be facilitated by suitable biomarkers. Aim of the present study is to compare levels of cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers (total tau protein, phosphorylated-tau protein, protein 14-3-3 and amyloid beta) in Slovak population of CJD suspect cases, retrospectively in over a 10-year period. One thousand three hundred sixty-four CSF samples from patients with suspect CJD, forming a homogenous group in terms of geographical as well as of equal transport conditions, storage and laboratory processing, were analysed. Definite diagnosis of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease was confirmed in 101 patients with genetic form, and 60 patients with its sporadic form of the disease. Specificity of protein 14-3-3 and total tau in both forms CJD was similar (87 % for P14-3-3/85 % for total tau), sensitivity to P 14-3-3 and total tau was higher in sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD) (90/95 %) than in genetic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (gCJD) (89/74 %). As expected, the total tau levels were significantly higher in CJD patients than in controls, but there was also significant difference between gCJD and sCJD (levels in gCJD were lower; p = 0.003). There was no significant difference in p-tau and Abeta 1-42 levels neither between both CJD forms nor between CJD patients and control group."

The clinical importance of PGRN became especially evident in 2006, when heterozygous mutations in the GRN gene, resulting in haploinsufficiency, were found to be one of the main causes of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). FTLD is a clinically heterogenous disease that results in the progressive atrophy of the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain. Despite significant research, the exact function of PGRN and its mechanistic relationship to FTLD remain unclear. However, growing evidence suggests a role for PGRN in the lysosome-most striking being that homozygous GRN mutation leads to neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, a lysosomal storage disease. Since this discovery, several links between PGRN and the lysosome have been established, including the existence of two independent lysosomal trafficking pathways, intralysosomal processing of PGRN into discrete functional peptides, and direct and indirect regulation of lysosomal hydrolases. Here, we summarize the cellular functions of PGRN, its roles in the nervous system, and its link to multiple neurodegenerative diseases, with a particular focus dedicated to recent lysosome-related mechanistic developments."

After the aplastic anemia had developed, RS was established. The exudative retinopathy was successfully treated with photocoagulation on the right eye (RE). BACKGROUND: RS is characterized by fatal bone marrow failure, exudative retinopathy, neuroradiographic abnormalities, neurodevelopmental delay and skin abnormalities. Non-treated exudative retinopathy leads to blindness. METHODS: We report ophthalmological findings as follows: fundus photography and fluorescein angiography (FA) acquired by examinations under general anesthesia in patient with RS. Results of genetic tests helped to establish the diagnosis. RESULTS: Two-year old Caucasian male was examined due to total retinal detachment on LE and signs of chorioretinal scarring on RE. In preoperative screening, thrombocytopenia was detected; later, severe pancytopenia developed. Considering the hematological findings and clinical appearance, we suspected RS, which was confirmed by genetic tests. We found a pathogenic mutation in gene TINF2 (variant c.865C>T;p.Pro289Ser) in a mosaic state with autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. This mutation has not been described in RS yet. Blind LE was enucleated because of dolorous neovascular glaucoma. FA of RE shows excessive areas of capillary nonperfusion with vascular abnormalities and exudation. After the photocoagulation, the visual acuity (VA) on RE remains 0.9 at the age of 7 years. CONCLUSIONS: RS is an extremely rare condition.  The initial symptomatology could be ophthalmological or hematological. The positive finding of TINF2 gene mutation helped in establishing the correct diagnosis.

Epigenetic silencing of negative Wnt regulators leading to constitutive Wnt signaling has been observed in various cancers and warrants further attention. We have reported that a succinate ether derivative of alpha-tocotrienol (T3E) has potent cytotoxic effects in MM cells. Thus, in this study, we investigated whether the anti-MM effect of T3E could be mediated via the epigenetic alteration of the Wnt antagonist gene, Dickkopf-1 (DKK1). METHODS: WST-1 and cell analyzers were employed to analyze the effects of T3E on cell viability and apoptosis of human MM cell lines (H2452, H28). Real-time PCR and Western blot were performed to evaluate the expression at mRNA and protein levels. Methylation status and epigenetic modifications of DKK1's promoter regions after T3E treatment in MM cells were studied using methylation-specific PCR and Chromatin immunoprecipitation. Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown -(siRNA), and specific inhibitors, were used to validate DKK1 as a target of T3E. RESULTS: T3E markedly impaired MM cell viability, increased the expression of phosphorylated-JNK and DKK1 and suppressed cyclin D, a downstream target gene of Wnt signaling. Knockdown of DKK1 expression by siRNA or a specific JNK inhibitor confirmed the contribution of DKK1 and JNK to T3E-induced cytotoxicity in MM cells. On the other hand, cytoskeleton-associated protein 4 (CKAP4) expression, which promotes cell proliferation as a Wnt-independent DKK1 receptor was inhibited by T3E. Silencing CKAP4 by -siRNA did not appear to directly affect MM cell viability, thereby indicating that expression of both DKK1 and CKAP4 is required. Furthermore, T3E-mediated inhibition of both DNA methyltransferases (DNMT1, 3A, and 3B) and histone deacetylases (HDAC1, 2, 3, and 8) in MM cells leads to increased DKK1 expression, thereby promoting tumor growth inhibition. MM cells treated with Zebularine (a DNMT inhibitor) and sodium butyrate (an HDAC inhibitor) exhibited cytotoxic effects, which may explain the inhibitory action of T3E on MM cells. In addition, an enhanced expression of DKK1 in MM cells following T3E treatment is positively correlated with the methylation status of its promoter; T3E decreased DNA methylation and increased histone acetylation. Moreover, T3E specifically increased histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methylation activity, whereas no effects were observed on histone H3K9 and H3K27. CONCLUSIONS: Targeting the epigenetic induction of DKK1 may lead to effective treatment of MM, and T3E has great potential to induce anti-MM activity."

Previously, NK cells were thought to be short-lived, but we now know that NK cells can be long-lived and remember past exposures in response to CMV. NK cells use a plethora of activating and inhibitory receptors to recognize these changes and attack targets, but tumour cells often evade NK cells. Therefore, major efforts are being made to hone in on NK cell antitumour properties in immunotherapy. In the clinical setting, haploidentical NK cells can be adoptively transferred to help treat cancer. To expand NK cells in vivo and enhance tumour targeting, IL-15 is being tested in combination with a glycogen synthase kinase (GSK) 3 inhibitor (CHIR99021), an inhibitor that has been shown to expand mature, highly functional NK cells capable of killing multiple tumour targets. One major limitation to NK cell therapy is lack of specificity. To address this concern, bispecific or trispecific engagers that target NK cells to the tumour and an ADAM17 inhibitor that prevents CD16 shedding after NK cell activation are being tested. Additionally, monoclonal antibodies are being designed to redirect the inhibitory signals that limit NK cell functionality. Further understanding of the biology of NK cells will inform strategies to exploit NK cells for therapeutic purposes."

The complexity of neurodegenerative disease mechanisms can be highlighted by accumulating evidence for a role for a growth factor, progranulin (PGRN). PGRN is a glycoprotein encoded by the GRN/Grn gene with multiple cellular functions, including neurotrophic, anti-inflammatory and lysosome regulatory properties. Mutations in the GRN gene can lead to frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), a cause of dementia, and neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL), a lysosomal storage disease. Both diseases are associated with loss of PGRN function resulting, amongst other features, in enhanced microglial neuroinflammation and lysosomal dysfunction. PGRN has also been implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Unlike FTLD, increased expression of PGRN occurs in brains of human AD cases and AD model mice, particularly in activated microglia. How microglial PGRN might be involved in AD and other neurodegenerative diseases will be discussed. A unifying feature of PGRN in diseases might be its modulation of lysosomal function in neurons and microglia. Many experimental models have focused on consequences of PGRN gene deletion: however, possible outcomes of increasing PGRN on microglial inflammation and neurodegeneration will be discussed. We will also suggest directions for future studies on PGRN and microglia in relation to neurodegenerative diseases."

Several conserved proteins are known to additionally participate in receptor chaperone assemblies, but the regulation of the process is not understood in detail. Also, it is unknown to what extent the contribution of these cofactors is conserved in other eukaryotes. We here examine the reconstituted C. elegans and human chaperone assemblies. We find that the nematode phosphatase PPH-5 and the prolyl isomerase FKB-6 facilitate the formation of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) complexes with Hsp90. Within these complexes, Hsp90 can perform its closing reaction more efficiently. By combining chemical crosslinking and mass spectrometry, we define contact sites within these assemblies. Compared to the nematode Hsp90 system, the human system shows less cooperative client interaction and a stricter requirement for the co-chaperone p23 to complete the closing reaction of GR Hsp90 Pp5/Fkbp51/Fkbp52 complexes. In both systems, hormone binding to GR is accelerated by Hsp90 alone and in the presence of its cofactors. Our results show that cooperative complex formation and hormone binding patterns are, in many aspects, conserved between the nematode and human systems."

This case control study included 21 patients (mean age, 49.4 y; 12 women) with myositis who underwent SWE, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and biopsy of the involved muscle group. SWE was performed accordingly in a control group (n = 24; mean age, 51.2 y; 8 women). Blood tests consisted of creatine kinase (CK) and aldolase. Two operators performed SWE in longitudinal and transverse planes of muscular fibers, quantifying the mean shear-wave velocity (SWV) and the pattern of stiffness. On MRI, short-TI inversion recovery (STIR) signal hyperintensity and T1 contrast enhancement of muscle was considered diagnostic for myositis. The patient group suffered from different types of myositis (nine patients with polymyositis, eight with dermatomyositis and four with other types of myositis). Blood tests showed significantly increased CK and aldolase values in patients with myositis (p < 0.001 and p < 0.0001). MRI showed a sensitivity of 0.95. In the patient group, the mean SWVs of longitudinal and transverse measurements were 2.8 +- 1.4 m/s and 3.1 +- 1.2 m/s, respectively. In the control group, SWVs were 2.3 +- 0.5 m/s and 2.4 +- 0.5 m/s, respectively. The difference between transverse measurements was significant (p = 0.02). Increased heterogeneity as a marker for myositis in transverse SWE showed a sensitivity of 0.8, specificity of 0.79, positive predictive value (PPV) of 0.76 and negative predictive value (NPV) of 0.82. Inter-observer difference was very low (kappa = 0.92). Increased heterogeneity in both planes compared with histologic results showed a sensitivity of 0.56, specificity of 0.93, PPV of 0.91 and NPV of 0.62. Spearman correlation between CK <1000 U/L and SWE was 0.54. In conclusion, transverse orientation SWE may serve as an imaging biomarker for the diagnosis of myositis through the display of a heterogeneous pattern and increased absolute SWV values of inflamed muscles."

The saprophytic fungi of Mucorales species cause the disease, Mucormycosis, only in immunocompromised hosts. Clinical presentation of mucormycosis is related to the underlying conditions; rhino-cerebral disease is the most common form, especially in patients with diabetes mellitus; pulmonary, cutaneous, or gastrointestinal infections can also occur. Severe COVID-19 itself is a life-threatening disease and various factors, including diabetes, especially when complicated by ketoacidosis, previous respiratory pathology, immunosuppressive therapy, nosocomial infection sources and systemic immune alterations of COVID-19 itself predispose to mucormycosis. No specific biomarkers are available to diagnose mucormycosis; imaging of the involved area and histopathological examination of the biopsied tissue are most important in diagnosis. The underlying medical conditions must be corrected; these include good glycemic control, tapering of steroids, and reducing or stopping immunosuppressive medications. Systemic antifungal therapy with liposomal Amphotericin B is the medical treatment of choice though drug resistance is not uncommon. Surgical debridement of devitalized tissue is often required. Severe COVID-19 patients with secondary co-infections require longer hospitalization and had higher risks of death. The mortality rate is almost 50% despite timely adequate treatment. The judicious use of systemic glucocorticoids and immunosuppressive agents for treating severe disease and hyperglycemia control seems vital for preventing and managing mucormycosis."

The clinical phenotype is highly heterogeneous, being associated with bleeding, thrombosis, or absence of symptoms.

Genetic testing is a key point for confirming the clinical diagnosis. The identification of the precise genetic mutations of congenital fibrinogen disorders is of value to permit early testing of other at risk persons and better understand the correlation between clinical phenotype and genotype.

Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) have also been reported but in a very small number of cases. This report aims to increase awareness about CVST as a potential neurological thromboembolic complication in patients with coronavirus disease. We report three COVID-19 patients presenting with CVTS. We also review all previously described cases and present an overview of their demographic, clinical, and diagnostic data. We describe three patients with concomitant coronavirus disease and CVST among 1000 hospitalized COVID-19 patients (2 males, 1female, and mean age of 37 years). One patient was previously healthy, while the two others had a history of chronic anemia and ulcerative colitis, respectively. CVST symptoms including seizure in two patients and headache in one patient occurred day to weeks after the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. Three months of anticoagulant therapy was given for all three patients with favorable outcomes. No neurological sequelae and no recurrence occurred within 6 months after hospital discharge. Our search identified 33 cases of COVID-19 complicated by CVST. The mean age was 45.3 years, there was a slight male predominance (60%), and more than half of cases were diagnosed in previously healthy individuals. All cases of CVT were clinically symptomatic and were observed in patients with a different spectrum of coronavirus disease severity. Headache was the most common complaint, reported by just less than half of patients. There was a high mortality rate (30.3%). CVT is a very rare, but potentially life-threatening complication in patients with COVID-19. It's mainly reported in relatively young individuals with no or little comorbid disease and can occur even in patients who do not display severe respiratory symptoms. Atypical clinical presentations may pose a challenge to the early diagnosis and treatment. High suspicion is necessary as early diagnosis and prompt treatment with anticoagulation in all patients with COVID-19 and CVT could contain the mortality rate and improve neurological outcomes in these patients."

Mucormycosis or black fungus infections in patients with recent COVID-19 infections has given rise to a new epidemic during the second wave of this current COVID-19 pandemic in India. Steroid misuse, poor glycemic control, use of industrial grade oxygen, improper humidification and specific variants strains have resulted in profound immunosuppression and are attributed for the high incidence of COVID associated Mucormycosis (CAM) in India. The aims of the present study were to assess the age and gender specific incidence of CAM, the utility of special stains (PAS and GMS) for diagnosing mucormycosis (false negatives and sensitivity). In the present study emphasis was laid on identifying if there exists a correlation between host response, angioinvasion and bone invasion with mortality. The Present study is a retrospective, cross sectional analytical study taken up in the Department of Pathology, Guntur Medical College for a period of 2 months between 1st of May 2021 to 30th of June 2021. Results were tabulated in Microsoft excel 2016 and SPSS software version 14 was used for calculation of odds ratio and for performing multivariate analysis. All samples were routinely fixed using 10% buffered formalin, processed and sectioned. All the sections were stained with Haematoxylin and Eosin and also special stains for fungus like periodic acid Schiff (PAS) and Gomori Methenamine silver (GMS) were used wherever required. CAM is a serious complication after recovery from COVID-19 infection due to its high morbidity and mortality (13.7% in this series). CAM epidemiology and presentation is mostly similar to non-COVID mucormycosis seen in pre-COVID era."

We compared the clinical development (autoantibody production and glomerulonephritis) of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in these three F1 hybrids in the presence or absence of the mutant gene, Yaa (Y chromosome-linked autoimmune acceleration), which normally accelerates the progression of murine SLE. (NZB x BXSB)F1 hybrid female mice bearing either the H-2b/b or H-2d/b haplotype developed a rapid course of severe SLE, while the appearance of disease was markedly delayed in H-2d/d hybrid females. However, in the presence of the Yaa gene, H-2d/d F1 males developed SLE as severe as H-2b/b and H-2d/b F1 males. These data indicate that (a) the conventional H-2b is a haplotype leading to susceptibility for murine SLE, while H-2d is a relatively resistant haplotype; (b) the H-2b haplotype exhibits a dominant effect on autoimmune responses, similar to the classical MHC-linked Ir gene effect; and (c) most strikingly, the Yaa gene totally abrogates the MHC effect on murine lupus in (NZB x BXSB)F1 hybrid mice."

Risk factors so far identified include pre-existing choroidal naevi for uveal melanomas, primary acquired melanosis (PAM) for conjunctival tumours, and ocular and oculodermal melanocytosis for uveal and orbital lesions. The atypical mole syndrome (AMS) is associated with uveal and conjunctival melanomas, especially when the ocular lesions are multiple or familial. AMS patients should be screened for ocular melanomas. Conjunctival melanomas are managed by excision with or without adjunctive beta-irradiation. Circumscribed tumours have a better prognosis than diffuse and multifocal lesions arising in acquired melanosis and attempts should be made to limit the progress of the latter variant of the disease by treating PAM with cryotherapy. The most significant prognostic factor in uveal melanoma is the size of the tumour at presentation. Early dissemination is the rule and every effort should be made to distinguish a melanoma from a naevus as soon as possible. Small and medium-sized melanomas respond well to focal treatments chosen according to the size and location of the tumour. The techniques employed include photocoagulation, radioactive plaque therapy, proton beam radiotherapy and surgical resection."

Here we describe two new dual specificity phosphatases of the CL100/MKP-1 family that are selective for inactivating ERK or JNK/SAPK and p38 MAP kinases when expressed in COS-7 cells. M3/6 is the first phosphatase of this family to display highly specific inactivation of JNK/SAPK and p38 MAP kinases. Although stress-induced activation of p54 SAPKbeta, p46 SAPKgamma (JNK1) or p38 MAP kinases is abolished upon co-transfection with increasing amounts of M3/6 plasmid, epidermal growth factor-stimulated ERK1 is remarkably insensitive even to the highest levels of M3/6 expression obtained. In contrast to M3/6, the dual specificity phosphatase MKP-3 is selective for inactivation of ERK family MAP kinases. Low level expression of MKP-3 blocks totally epidermal growth factor-stimulated ERK1, whereas stress-induced activation of p54 SAPKbeta and p38 MAP kinases is inhibited only partially under identical conditions. Selective regulation by M3/6 and MKP-3 was also observed upon chronic MAP kinase activation by constitutive p21(ras) GTPases. Hence, although M3/6 expression effectively blocked p54 SAPKbeta activation by p21(rac) (G12V), ERK1 activated by p21(ras) (G12V) was insensitive to this phosphatase. ERK1 activation by oncogenic p21(ras) was, however, blocked totally by co-expression of MKP-3. This is the first report demonstrating reciprocally selective inhibition of different MAP kinases by two distinct dual specificity phosphatases."

STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: U-105MG or CH-157MN cells were irradiated with polychromatic light in the presence of ALA. A Xenon lamp (150 W) was used as the light source. For the study on the effect of growth factor on ALA-PDT, cells were cultured in serum free medium for 24 hours. Epidermal growth factor (EGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), or platelet derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB) was added to achieve a final concentration of 50 ng/ml. 30 minutes later, cells were incubated with ALA (100 microg/ml) for 24 hours, washed, and irradiated with light (11 J/cm2). MTT tetrazolium assays were performed 24 hours after light irradiation. RESULTS: The inhibition of metabolic cellular function in U-105MG cells by ALA depended on both light energy density and ALA concentration. The susceptibility to ALA-PDT was profoundly lower for CH-157MN meningioma cells than U-105MG glioma cells. When incubated with ALA (100 microg/ml), U-105MG cells exhibited an LD50 around 8 J/cm2 of light irradiation, whereas that of CH-157MN cells was more than 25 J/cm2. EGF, bFGF, or PDGF-BB did not have any effects on the susceptibility of these two cell lines to ALA-PDT. CONCLUSION: ALA-PDT was more effective in killing U-105MG glioma cells than CH-157MN meningioma cells. The differential susceptibility was likely due to differential accumulation of PpIX in these cells. EGF, bFGF, or PDGF-BB did not have stimulatory or inhibitory effect on the efficiency of ALA-PDT."

A 76-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital in October, 1996 because of head heaviness without obvious neurological deficits. Previous CT scan in 1989 revealed no abnormality, but a subsequent scan in 1992 showed a low-density area in the right frontal region. Since then the patient has been followed up as a case of cerebral infarction. At the time of the current admission, CT scan disclosed the low-density area as having grown to the size of 4 cm and heterogeneously enhanced after injection of contrast medium. On MRI the mass lesion was depicted as low-intensity on T1-weighted image and high-intensity on T2-weighted image. The mass was heterogeneously enhanced after administration of Gd-DTPA. Right internal and external carotid angiograms revealed neither tumor feeder nor tumor stain. Craniogram showed neither hyperostosis nor bone erosion, and yet bone scintigram demonstrated markedly increased uptake involving the right frontal bone near the tumor. At surgery the tumor was found to have originated from the dura in the right frontal convexity, which was well demarcated and separated from the surrounding brain tissue. Total removal designated as Simpson grade I procedure was accomplished. Light microscopy revealed abundant microcysts of varied size throughout the tumor tissue with the presence of whorl formation and psammoma body, but no malignancy was indicated. Electron microscopy further demonstrated interdigitation of the neighboring cell membranes, desmosomes, and intracytoplasmic filaments, which are pathognomonic findings of meningiomas. The microcysts were seen to reside in the extracellular spaces rather than in the cytoplasm. With these pathological findings, the tumor was finally diagnosed as microcystic meningioma."

Interleukin-6 receptor/interleukin-6 chimera (IL6RIL6) induces in B16/F10.9 melanoma cells a loss of melanogenesis preceded by a sharp decrease in Mitf mRNA and gene promoter activity. In the Mitf promoter, the main cis-acting element mediating the IL6RIL6 effect is shown to be the binding site of Pax3, a paired homeodomain factor regulating among other things the development of melanocytes. Pax3 protein and mRNA levels decline steadily after IL6RIL6 treatment, and overexpression of an ectopic Pax3 cDNA suppresses the Mitf promoter inhibition. Loss of the synergism between Pax3 and Sox10, a high mobility group domain costimulatory factor, seems to be critical in the rapid decrease in Mitf gene expression. The Pax3 down-regulation in IL6RIL6-induced F10.9 cell is linked to growth arrest and transdifferentiation to a glial cell phenotype. IL6RIL6 stimulates the interleukin-6 family cytokine receptor gp130, leading to the rapid phosphorylation of Stat3 on tyrosine 705. This phosphorylation is required for Pax3 down-regulation and Mitf promoter silencing since these are inhibited in F10.9 cells overexpressing the Stat3 DN-mutant Y705F."

These replication defects were associated with activation of the intra-S phase checkpoint. Activation of the checkpoint was critical for viability of rrm3Delta cells, especially at low temperatures. Each site whose replication was affected by Rrm3p is assembled into a nonnucleosomal protein-DNA complex. At tRNA genes and the silent mating type loci, disruption of these complexes eliminated dependence upon Rrm3p.

METHODS: A total of 11 male and eight female patients underwent assessment with computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. The patients ranged from 1 to 17 years in age. The evaluated parameters were: location of the lesions, midline structural shift effect, ipsilateral calvarial and parenchymal changes. RESULTS: Left cerebral hemiatrophy was seen in 14 of the cases while right cerebral hemiatrophy was observed in five cases. Unilateral calvarial thickening was seen in 11 cases, hyperpneumatization of paranasal sinuses in five, and hypoplasia of the middle frontal cranial fossa in three patients. Cerebral peduncle atrophy was noted in seven cases. In total, 11 patients had thalamic atrophy and lentiform nucleus hypoplasia. In one case, cerebral hemiatrophy was associated with ipsilateral large schizencephalic cleft and absence of the septum pellucidum, whereas in another case, there was diffuse cerebellar atrophy associated with cerebral hemiatrophy. CONCLUSION: Computed tomography and, in particular, magnetic resonance imaging are the procedures of choice with respect to assessment of the etiology and extent of cerebral parenchymal involvement in cerebral hemiatrophy."

Exposure of cells to the iPLA(2) selective inhibitor bromoenol lactone (BEL; 0-20 microM) induced concentration- and time-dependent decreases in cell growth based on 3-(4, dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide staining and cell number. Decreased cell growth was not caused by cell death as BEL exposure did not alter nuclear morphology or increase annexin V (apoptotic cell marker) or propidium iodide (necrotic cell marker) staining after 48 h. Decreased growth correlated to a G(1)/G(0) arrest in LNCaP cells and aG(2)/M arrest in PC-3 cells. In LNCaP cells, G(1) arrest was preceded by time- (0-48 h) and concentration-dependent (0-10 microM) increases in the expression of the tumor suppressor protein p53 and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21. Increases in p53 expression preceded increases in p21 expression by 8 h. In LNCaP cells, BEL treatment decreased the expression of the p53 antagonist Mdm2, while increasing Akt phosphorylation. BEL treatment also increased Akt phosphorylation in PC-3 cells, but Mdm2 was not detected. The ability of BEL to increase Akt phosphorylation was inhibited by the phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 [2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one]. BEL treatment also decreased agonist-induced activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor. These data suggest that inhibition of iPLA(2) decreases prostate cancer cell growth by p53-dependent and independent mechanisms. Furthermore, alterations in Mdm2 and epidermal growth factor receptor activation following BEL exposure suggest novel roles for iPLA(2) in prostate cancer cell signaling."

Mutations in RyR2 have been linked to exercise-induced sudden cardiac death (catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia [CPVT]). CPVT-associated RyR2 mutations result in \"leaky\" RyR2 channels due to the decreased binding of the calstabin2 (FKBP12.6) subunit, which stabilizes the closed state of the channel. We found that mice heterozygous for the R2474S mutation in Ryr2 (Ryr2-R2474S mice) exhibited spontaneous generalized tonic-clonic seizures (which occurred in the absence of cardiac arrhythmias), exercise-induced ventricular arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death. Treatment with a novel RyR2-specific compound (S107) that enhances the binding of calstabin2 to the mutant Ryr2-R2474S channel inhibited the channel leak and prevented cardiac arrhythmias and raised the seizure threshold. Thus, CPVT-associated mutant leaky Ryr2-R2474S channels in the brain can cause seizures in mice, independent of cardiac arrhythmias. Based on these data, we propose that CPVT is a combined neurocardiac disorder in which leaky RyR2 channels in the brain cause epilepsy, and the same leaky channels in the heart cause exercise-induced sudden cardiac death."

These findings suggest that endothelial cells not only form passive conduits to deliver nutrients and oxygen, but also establish an instructive vascular niche, which through elaboration of paracrine trophogens stimulates organ regeneration, in a manner similar to endothelial-cell-derived angiocrine factors that support haematopoiesis. However, the precise mechanism by which tissue-specific subsets of endothelial cells promote organogenesis in adults is unknown. Here we demonstrate that liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) constitute a unique population of phenotypically and functionally defined VEGFR3(+)CD34(-)VEGFR2(+)VE-cadherin(+)FactorVIII(+)CD45(-) endothelial cells, which through the release of angiocrine trophogens initiate and sustain liver regeneration induced by 70% partial hepatectomy. After partial hepatectomy, residual liver vasculature remains intact without experiencing hypoxia or structural damage, which allows study of physiological liver regeneration. Using this model, we show that inducible genetic ablation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A receptor-2 (VEGFR2) in the LSECs impairs the initial burst of hepatocyte proliferation (days 1-3 after partial hepatectomy) and subsequent reconstitution of the hepatovascular mass (days 4-8 after partial hepatectomy) by inhibiting upregulation of the endothelial-cell-specific transcription factor Id1. Accordingly, Id1-deficient mice also manifest defects throughout liver regeneration, owing to diminished expression of LSEC-derived angiocrine factors, including hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and Wnt2. Notably, in in vitro co-cultures, VEGFR2-Id1 activation in LSECs stimulates hepatocyte proliferation. Indeed, intrasplenic transplantation of Id1(+/+) or Id1(-/-) LSECs transduced with Wnt2 and HGF (Id1(-/-)Wnt2(+)HGF(+) LSECs) re-establishes an inductive vascular niche in the liver sinusoids of the Id1(-/-) mice, initiating and restoring hepatovascular regeneration. Therefore, in the early phases of physiological liver regeneration, VEGFR2-Id1-mediated inductive angiogenesis in LSECs through release of angiocrine factors Wnt2 and HGF provokes hepatic proliferation. Subsequently, VEGFR2-Id1-dependent proliferative angiogenesis reconstitutes liver mass. Therapeutic co-transplantation of inductive VEGFR2(+)Id1(+)Wnt2(+)HGF(+) LSECs with hepatocytes provides an effective strategy to achieve durable liver regeneration."

Searches were limited to articles published in English. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Clinical trials evaluating teplizumab for type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) published in English were selected from the data sources. All published relevant abstracts were included. References cited in identified articles were used for additional citations. DATA SYNTHESIS: T1DM accounts for up to 10% of all cases of diabetes mellitus. T1DM is characterized as a chronic and progressive autoimmune disease leading to the destruction of insulin-producing beta-cells of the pancreas. Teplizumab is a humanized Fc-mutated anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody that alters the function of the T-lymphocytes that mediate the destruction of the insulin-producing beta-cells. While clinical data are limited, both Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies have demonstrated preserved C-peptide response as a measure of insulin production, decreased exogenous insulin use, and improved glycemic control following a 12- to 14-day teplizumab infusion in patients diagnosed with T1DM within the previous 6 weeks. However, 1 Phase 3 trial failed to find the same benefits in those diagnosed with T1DM within the previous 12 weeks when a lower cumulative teplizumab dose was used. Initial studies indicated that teplizumab is well tolerated, with a self-limiting rash as the most commonly reported adverse effect. CONCLUSIONS: Teplizumab is an anti-CD3 human monoclonal antibody with promising activity in treatment of patients with T1DM. Results from Phase 3 trials are needed to further determine safety, efficacy, and dosing frequency."

The (18)F-flutemetamol based classifier was able to replicate the assignments obtained by visual reads with 100% accuracy. The voxels with highest feature weights were in the striatum, precuneus, cingulate and middle frontal gyrus. Second, to determine concordance between the gray matter volume- and the (18)F-flutemetamol-based classification, we trained the classifier with the clinical diagnosis as gold standard.

Prion diseases (also known as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies) are fatal neurodegenerative diseases that are pathologically well characterized as the accumulation of disease-associated misfolded prion proteins, spongiform changes, glial cell activation and neuronal loss. We previously demonstrated that the upregulation of PAD2, mainly found in reactive astrocytes of infected brains, leads to excessive citrullination, which is correlated with disease progression. Further, we demonstrated that various cytoskeletal and energy metabolism-associated proteins are particularly vulnerable to citrullination. Our recent in vivo and in vitro studies elicited altered functions of enolase as the result of citrullination; these altered functions included reduced enzyme activity, increased protease sensitivity and enhanced plasminogen-binding affinity. These findings suggest that PAD2 and citrullinated proteins may play a key role in the brain pathology of prion diseases. By extension, we believe that abnormal increases in protein citrullination may be strong evidence of neurodegeneration."

        "text": "Bruton's tyrosine kinase mediated signaling enhances leukemogenesis in a mouse model for chronic lymphocytic leukemia.\nIn chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) signals from the B cell receptor (BCR) play a major role in disease development and progression. In this light, new therapies that specifically target signaling molecules downstream of the BCR continue to be developed. While first studies on the selective small molecule inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk), Ibrutinib (PCI-32765), demonstrated that Btk inhibition sensitizes CLL cells to apoptosis and alters their migratory behavior, these studies however did not address whether Btk-mediated signaling is involved in the process of CLL leukemogenesis. To investigate the requirement of Btk signaling for CLL development, we modulated Btk expression in the IgH.ETmu CLL mouse model, which is based on sporadic expression of the simian oncovirus SV40 T-antigen in mature B cells. To this end, we crossed IgH.ETmu mice on a Btk-deficient background or introduced a human Btk transgene (CD19-hBtk). Here we show that Btk deficiency fully abrogates CLL formation in IgH.ETmu mice, and that leukemias formed in Btk haplo-insufficient mice selectively expressed the wild-type Btk allele on their active X chromosome. Conversely, Btk overexpression accelerated CLL onset, increased mortality, and was associated with selection of non-stereotypical BCRs into CLL clones. Taken together, these data show that Btk expression represents an absolute prerequisite for CLL development and that Btk mediated signaling enhances leukemogenesis in mice. We therefore conclude that in CLL Btk expression levels set the threshold for malignant transformation."

However, the temporal profile by which OB somatostatin-expressing (Som+) interneurons are produced and the molecular mechanisms controlling this profile are totally unknown. In the present study, we found that all the Som+ interneurons in the mouse external plexiform layer (EPL) and the rat glomerular layer (GL) express the transcription factor Sp8.Using the 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) birth dating method, combined with immunostaining, we showed that the generation of Som+ interneurons in the mouse and rat OB is confined to the later embryonic and earlier postnatal stages. Within the mouse OB, the production of Som+ interneurons is maximal during late embryogenesis and decreases after birth, whereas the generation of Som+ interneurons is low during embryogenesis and increases gradually after birth in the rat OB. Interestingly, genetic ablation of Sp8 by cre/loxP-based recombination severely reduces the number of Som+ interneurons in the EPL of the mouse OB. Taken together, these results suggest that Sp8 is required for the normal production of Som+ interneurons in the EPL of the mouse OB. "

In this review, we address the intertwined relationship of these two key molecules by fighting each other as eternal rivals in many signaling pathways. p53 represses the promoter of Polo-like kinase 1, whereas Polo-like kinase 1 inhibits p53 and its family members p63 and p73 in cancer cells lacking functional p53. Plk1 inhibitors target all rapidly dividing cells irrespective of tumor cells or non-transformed normal but proliferating cells. Upon treatment with Plk1 inhibitors, p53 in tumor cells is activated and induces strong apoptosis, whereas tumor cells with inactive p53 arrest in mitosis with DNA damage. Thus, inactive p53 is not associated with a susceptible cytotoxicity of Polo-like kinase 1 inhibition and could rather foster the induction of polyploidy/aneuploidy in surviving cells. In addition, compared to the mono-treatment, combination of Polo-like kinase 1 inhibition with anti-mitotic or DNA damaging agents boosts more severe mitotic defects, effectually triggers apoptosis and strongly inhibits proliferation of cancer cells with functional p53. In this regard, restoration of p53 in tumor cells with loss or mutation of p53 will reinforce the cytotoxicity of combined Polo-like kinase 1 therapy and provide a proficient strategy for combating relapse and metastasis of cancer.

        "text": "A review of tuberculosis: Focus on bedaquiline.\nPURPOSE: The history and prevalence of tuberculosis and the role of bedaquiline in multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis are reviewed. SUMMARY: Tuberculosis continues to cause significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Increasing rates of drug-resistant tuberculosis are a significant concern and pose serious implications for current and future treatment of the disease. In December 2012, the Food and Drug Administration approved bedaquiline as part of the treatment regimen for pulmonary MDR tuberculosis. Bedaquiline's unique mechanism of action presents an alternative approach to current antimycobacterial killing. By directly inhibiting adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase, bedaquiline is effective against both replicating and dormant mycobacteria. Pulmonary cavitary lesions can contain heterogeneous populations. This potential mix of semireplicating and hypometabolic mycobacteria is more difficult to eliminate with conventional antitubercular drugs, thus increasing the risk of resistance. No in vitro cross-resistance between bedaquiline and currently available antitubercular agents has been observed thus far. Because bedaquiline targets a completely different enzyme, cross-resistance with other conventional agents remains unlikely. Enhanced sterilizing capacity via synergistic depletion of ATP further exhibits the promising potential of bedaquiline with pyrazinamide. A course of bedaquiline requires 24 weeks of therapy in combination with other antitubercular drugs. CONCLUSION: The approval of bedaquiline represents a major milestone in MDR tuberculosis therapy. Bedaquiline should be considered in patients who have not responded to a regimen containing four second-line drugs and pyrazinamide and patients with documented evidence of MDR tuberculosis resistant to fluoroquinolones. The exact role of bedaquiline cannot be determined until further efficacy and safety data are obtained through ongoing Phase III trials."

METHODS: We assessed 9 functional polymorphisms in 6 genes that affect the metabolism of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) to evaluate potential interactions with parental smoking during pregnancy in a population-based case-control study of childhood brain tumors. Cases (N = 202) were <=10 years old, diagnosed from 1984-1991 and identified in three Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registries in the western U.S. Controls in the same regions (N = 286) were frequency matched by age, sex, and study center. DNA for genotyping was obtained from archived newborn dried blood spots. RESULTS: We found positive interaction odds ratios (ORs) for both maternal and paternal smoking during pregnancy, EPHX1 H139R, and childhood brain tumors (P(interaction) = 0.02; 0.10), such that children with the high-risk (greater PAH activation) genotype were at a higher risk of brain tumors relative to children with the low-risk genotype when exposed to tobacco smoke during pregnancy. A dose-response pattern for paternal smoking was observed among children with the EPHX1 H139R high-risk genotype only (OR(no exposure) = 1.0; OR(<=3 hours/day) = 1.32, 95% CI: 0.52-3.34; OR(>3 hours/day )= 3.18, 95% CI: 0.92-11.0; P(trend )= 0.07). CONCLUSION: Parental smoking during pregnancy may be a risk factor for childhood brain tumors among genetically susceptible children who more rapidly activate PAH in tobacco smoke."

        "text": "Nucleosome repositioning links DNA (de)methylation and differential CTCF binding during stem cell development.\nDuring differentiation of embryonic stem cells, chromatin reorganizes to establish cell type-specific expression programs. Here, we have dissected the linkages between DNA methylation (5mC), hydroxymethylation (5hmC), nucleosome repositioning, and binding of the transcription factor CTCF during this process. By integrating MNase-seq and ChIP-seq experiments in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESC) and their differentiated counterparts with biophysical modeling, we found that the interplay between these factors depends on their genomic context. The mostly unmethylated CpG islands have reduced nucleosome occupancy and are enriched in cell type-independent binding sites for CTCF. The few remaining methylated CpG dinucleotides are preferentially associated with nucleosomes. In contrast, outside of CpG islands most CpGs are methylated, and the average methylation density oscillates so that it is highest in the linker region between nucleosomes. Outside CpG islands, binding of TET1, an enzyme that converts 5mC to 5hmC, is associated with labile, MNase-sensitive nucleosomes. Such nucleosomes are poised for eviction in ESCs and become stably bound in differentiated cells where the TET1 and 5hmC levels go down. This process regulates a class of CTCF binding sites outside CpG islands that are occupied by CTCF in ESCs but lose the protein during differentiation. We rationalize this cell type-dependent targeting of CTCF with a quantitative biophysical model of competitive binding with the histone octamer, depending on the TET1, 5hmC, and 5mC state. "

However, the mechanism through which HIF-1 stabilization actually confers this cardioprotection is not clear. We investigated whether HIF-1alpha stabilization protects the heart against acute IRI by preventing the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) and the potential mechanisms involved. METHODS AND RESULTS: Stabilization of myocardial HIF-1 was achieved by pharmacological inhibition of prolyl hydroxylase (PHD) domain-containing enzyme using GSK360A or using cardiac-specific ablation of von Hippel-Lindau protein (VHL(fl/fl)) in mice. Treatment of HL-1 cardiac cells with GSK360A stabilized HIF-1, increased the expression of HIF-1 target genes pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-1 (PDK1) and hexokinase II (HKII), and reprogrammed cell metabolism to aerobic glycolysis, thereby resulting in the production of less mitochondrial oxidative stress during IRI, and less MPTP opening, effects which were shown to be dependent on HKII. These findings were further confirmed when HIF-1 stabilization in the rat and murine heart resulted in smaller myocardial infarct sizes (both in vivo and ex vivo), decreased mitochondrial oxidative stress, and inhibited MPTP opening following IRI, effects which were also found to be dependent on HKII. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated that acute HIF-1alpha stabilization using either a pharmacological or genetic approach protected the heart against acute IRI by promoting aerobic glycolysis, decreasing mitochondrial oxidative stress, activating HKII, and inhibiting MPTP opening."

METHODS AND RESULTS: ROCKET AF excluded patients with mitral stenosis or artificial valve prostheses. We used Cox regression to adjust comparisons for potential confounders. Among 14 171 patients, 2003 (14.1%) had SVD; they were older and had more comorbidities than patients without SVD. The rate of stroke or systemic embolism with rivaroxaban vs. warfarin was consistent among patients with SVD [2.01 vs. 2.43%; hazard ratio (HR) 0.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55-1.27] and without SVD (1.96 vs. 2.22%; HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.75-1.07; interaction P = 0.76). However, rates of major and non-major clinically relevant bleeding with rivaroxaban vs. warfarin were higher in patients with SVD (19.8% rivaroxaban vs. 16.8% warfarin; HR 1.25, 95% CI 1.05-1.49) vs. those without (14.2% rivaroxaban vs. 14.1% warfarin; HR 1.01, 95% CI 0.94-1.10; interaction P = 0.034), even when controlling for risk factors and potential confounders. In intracranial haemorrhage, there was no interaction between patients with and without SVD where the overall rate was lower among those randomized to rivaroxaban. CONCLUSIONS: Many patients with 'non-valvular atrial fibrillation' have significant valve lesions. Their risk of stroke is similar to that of patients without SVD after controlling for stroke risk factors. Efficacy of rivaroxaban vs. warfarin was similar in patients with and without SVD; however, the observed risk of bleeding was higher with rivaroxaban in patients with SVD but was the same among those without SVD.

The first mutations identified were null mutations giving rise to haploinsufficiency. Missense mutations were subsequently detected, but only a small subset has been functionally investigated. We identified missense mutations (C105Y, A199V, and R298H) in FTLD cases with family history and/or with low plasma PGRN levels. The aim of this study was to determine their pathogenicity. We performed functional studies, analyzing PGRN expression, secretion, and cleavage by elastase. GRN C105Y affected both secretion and elastase cleavage, likely representing a pathogenic mutation. GRN A199V did not alter the physiological properties of PGRN and GRN R298H produced only moderate effects on PGRN secretion, indicating that their pathogenicity is uncertain. In the absence of strong segregation data and neuropathological examinations, genetic, biomarker, and functional studies can be applied to an algorithm to assess the likelihood of pathogenicity for a mutation. This information can improve our understanding of the complex mechanisms by which GRN mutations lead to FTLD. "

Lenalidomide displayed a strong therapeutic effect in all these models of autoimmune/inflammatory diseases, while the effect of pomalidomide was less pronounced. In vitro experiments confirmed the immunosuppressive effect of both IMiDs on the proliferative response of stimulated human lymphocytes and on the balance of secreted cytokines toward an anti-inflammatory profile.

In 2016, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conditionally approved the first phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (morpholino)-based AO drug, eteplirsen, developed for DMD exon 51 skipping. Eteplirsen remains controversial with insufficient evidence of its therapeutic effect in patients. We recently developed an in silico tool to design antisense morpholino sequences for exon skipping. Here, we designed morpholino AOs targeting DMD exon 51 using the in silico tool and quantitatively evaluated the effects in immortalized DMD muscle cells in vitro. To our surprise, most of the newly designed morpholinos induced exon 51 skipping more efficiently compared with the eteplirsen sequence. The efficacy of exon 51 skipping and rescue of dystrophin protein expression were increased by up to more than 12-fold and 7-fold, respectively, compared with the eteplirsen sequence.

Our primary objective was to describe the impact of improvements in surgical technique on survival and rate of PPROM over time. The secondary objective was to assess potential risk factors for PPROM. DESIGN AND SETTING: Single-centre retrospective observational study. POPULATION: 1092 consecutive cases of TTTS operated by FLC between 2000 and 2016, with a 6.8% rate of loss to follow up. METHODS: The incidence of PPROM and potential risk factors were analysed using competing risks models. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: PPROM, neonatal survival and neurological damage at 28 days. RESULTS: PPROM <32 weeks increased from 15 to 40% between 2000 and 2016 along with an overall improvement of perinatal outcomes: dual survival rose from 42 to 66% whereas dual losses dropped two-fold, from 19 to 9%. Gestational age at surgery at <17 weeks was a significant risk-factor for PPROM, with an additional risk of 10% within the first week of surgery. Although early PPROM at <20 weeks carried a 56% risk of miscarriage, the occurrence of PPROM at >20 weeks did not affect survival, despite an increase in preterm birth at <32 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: With significant improvement in perinatal outcomes, possibly related to improvements in surgical technique, postoperative complications have shifted to non-lethal obstetric complications such as PPROM, with rather reassuring postnatal outcomes, despite an increase in preterm birth and, potentially, morbidity. Early surgeries (<17 weeks) are at higher risk of postoperative PPROM. TWEETABLE ABSTRACT: Following laser/TTTS, rates of PPROM increased with perinatal survival; surgeries at <17 weeks are at highest risk."

The chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy tisagenlecleucel targets and eliminates CD19-expressing B cells and showed efficacy against B-cell lymphomas in a single-center, phase 2a study. METHODS: We conducted an international, phase 2, pivotal study of centrally manufactured tisagenlecleucel involving adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma who were ineligible for or had disease progression after autologous hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. The primary end point was the best overall response rate (i.e., the percentage of patients who had a complete or partial response), as judged by an independent review committee. RESULTS: A total of 93 patients received an infusion and were included in the evaluation of efficacy. The median time from infusion to data cutoff was 14 months (range, 0.1 to 26). The best overall response rate was 52% (95% confidence interval, 41 to 62); 40% of the patients had complete responses, and 12% had partial responses. Response rates were consistent across prognostic subgroups. At 12 months after the initial response, the rate of relapse-free survival was estimated to be 65% (79% among patients with a complete response). The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events of special interest included cytokine release syndrome (22%), neurologic events (12%), cytopenias lasting more than 28 days (32%), infections (20%), and febrile neutropenia (14%). Three patients died from disease progression within 30 days after infusion. No deaths were attributed to tisagenlecleucel, cytokine release syndrome, or cerebral edema. No differences between response groups in tumor expression of CD19 or immune checkpoint-related proteins were found.

The crystals belong to the primitive tetragonal space group P43212, with unit-cell parameters a = b = 57.9, c = 172.0 A, and alpha = beta = gamma = 90 . The structure was elucidated by molecular replacement method using a mixed model of three homologous structures from the N-terminal sequence of ICChI. The refined model consists of 272 amino acid residues and has a Rfactor of 18.93% and Rfree of 22.42%. The protein consists of a single globular domain with a (alpha/beta)8 triosephosphate isomerase barrel fold. Three of the consensus sites for N-glycosylation viz., Asn45, Asn172, and Asn194 containing carbohydrate moieties N-Acetylglucosamine (NAG), mannose, fucose, and xylose. The putative catalytic residues are Asp125, Glu127, and Tyr184. The crystal structure may provide fundamental information of GH18 family chitinases."

They make up about 20% of all skull fractures and are mainly caused by high-velocity blunt trauma and falls from high heights. Depending on their precise location, they can be divided into frontobasal, laterobasal and frontolateral fractures. Possible clinical signs are the presence of cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea or otorrhea, periorbital ecchymosis (raccoon eyes), retroauricular ecchymosis (battle sign) and cranial nerve injuries. Furthermore, fractures of the petrous bone can lead to a conductive hearing loss, sensorineural hearing loss as well as dizziness and nausea due to a failure of the labyrinth. PRACTICAL RECOMMENDATIONS: If there are any clinical signs of a basilar skull fracture, neurological deficits or limited consciousness (GCS < 15), a CT should be performed to rule out a basilar skull fracture and accompanying pathologies. In addition, if vascular injury is suspected, a CT angiography should be performed. Treatment is usually interdisciplinary and depends mainly on the accompanying injuries and possible complications. A purely conservative approach with close controls (with imaging) is often sufficient. The surgical approach is primarily used to treat possible complications, for example intracerebral bleeding."

However, the reciprocal effects of these histone modifications on each other and their roles in enhancers are not clear. Here to comparatively analyze the role of these modifications, we inhibited H3K4me1 and H3K27ac by deleting the SET domains of histone methyltransferases MLL3 and MLL4 and the HAT domain of histone acetyltransferase p300, respectively, in erythroid K562 cells. The loss of H3K4me1 reduced H3K27ac at the beta-globin enhancer LCR HSs, but H3K27ac reduction did not affect H3K4me1. This unequal relationship between two modifications was revealed in putative enhancers by genome-wide analysis using ChIP-seq. Histone H3 eviction at putative enhancers was weakened by the loss of H3K4me1 but not by the loss of H3K27ac. Chromatin remodeling complexes were recruited into the beta-globin LCR HSs in a H3K4me1-dependent manner. In contrast, H3K27ac was required for enhancer RNA (eRNA) transcription, and H3K4me1 was not enough for it. Forced H3K27ac-induced eRNA transcription without affecting H3K4me1 at the beta-globin LCR HSs. These results indicate that H3K4me1 and H3K27ac affect each other in different ways and play more direct roles in nucleosome eviction and eRNA transcription, respectively, at enhancers."

However, in vitro and in vivo studies have suggested dual blockade of IL-17A and IL-17 F may be more effective than IL-17 A blockade alone. Bimekizumab is the first human monoclonal antibody to exert simultaneous specific inhibition of IL-17A and IL-17 F, and has been studied in several phase II/III trials for psoriasis and PsA. AREAS COVERED: Bimekizumab is not currently licensed for use. A literature search identified clinical trials examining the efficacy and safety of bimekizumab for psoriasis and PsA, and these were critically appraised. EXPERT OPINION: Clinical trials of bimekizumab have been promising, demonstrating a rapid onset of response and superior efficacy compared to three currently licensed biologics: secukinumab, ustekinumab, and adalimumab. Bimekizumab maintains a high level of efficacy with maintenance dosing intervals of 8 weeks, compared with 4 weeks for currently licensed IL-17A antagonists. No unexpected adverse events have been identified, although mild-to-moderate fungal infections occur in approximately 10%. Studies over longer time periods involving additional active comparators would be valuable in further defining the role of bimekizumab amongst currently available treatments."

It is a hexamer composed of two copies of three distinct chains: Aalpha, Bbeta, and gamma encoded by three genes, FGA, FGB, and FGG, clustered on the long arm of chromosome 4. Congenital fibrinogen disorders (CFDs) are divided into qualitative deficiencies (dysfibrinogenemia, hypodysfibrinogenemia) in which the mutant fibrinogen molecule is present in the circulation and quantitative deficiencies (afibrinogenemia, hypofibrinogenemia) with no mutant molecule present in the bloodstream. Phenotypic manifestations are variable, patients may be asymptomatic, or suffer from bleeding or thrombosis. Causative mutations can occur in any of the three fibrinogen genes and can affect one or both alleles. Given the large number of studies reporting on novel causative mutations for CFDs since the review on the same topic published in 2016, we performed an extensive search of the literature and list here 120 additional mutations described in both quantitative and qualitative disorders. The visualization of causative single nucleotide variations placed on the coding sequences of FGA, FGB, and FGG reveals important structure function insight for several domains of the fibrinogen molecule."

Fungal spores are normally present in the environment and the immune system of the body prevents them from causing disease in a healthy immunocompetent individual. But when the defense mechanism of the body is compromised such as in the patients of diabetes mellites, neustropenia, organ transplantation recipients, and other immune-compromised states, these fungal spores invade our defense mechanism easily causing a severe systemic infection with approximately 45-80% of case fatality. In the present scenario, during the COVID-19 pandemic, patients are on immunosuppressive drugs, glucocorticoids, thus are at high risk of mucormycosis. Patients with diabetes mellitus are further getting a high chance of infection. Usually, the spores gain entry through our respiratory tract affecting the lungs and paranasal sinuses. Besides, they can also enter through damage into the skin or through the gastrointestinal route. This review article presents the current statistics, the causes of this infection in the human body, and its diagnosis with available recent therapies through recent databases collected from several clinics and agencies. The diagnosis and identification of the infection were made possible through various latest medical techniques such as computed tomography scans, direct microscopic observations, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, serology, molecular assay, and histopathology. Mucormycosis is so uncommon, no randomized controlled treatment studies have been conducted. The newer triazoles, posaconazole (POSA) and isavuconazole (ISAV) (the active component of the prodrug isavuconazonium sulfate) may be beneficial in patients who are refractory to or intolerant of Liposomal Amphotericin B. but due to lack of early diagnosis and aggressive surgical debridement or excision, the mortality rate remains high. In the course of COVID-19 treatments, there must be more vigilance and alertness are required from clinicians to evaluate these invasive fungal infections."

Here, we developed a chimeric RBD-dimer vaccine approach to adapt SARS-CoV-2 variants. A prototype-Beta chimeric RBD-dimer was first designed to adapt the resistant Beta variant. Compared with its homotypic forms, the chimeric vaccine elicited broader sera neutralization of variants and conferred better protection in mice. The protection of the chimeric vaccine was further verified in macaques. This approach was generalized to develop Delta-Omicron chimeric RBD-dimer to adapt the currently prevalent variants. Again, the chimeric vaccine elicited broader sera neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 variants and conferred better protection against challenge by either Delta or Omicron SARS-CoV-2 in mice. The chimeric approach is applicable for rapid updating of immunogens, and our data supported the use of variant-adapted multivalent vaccine against circulating and emerging variants."

In particular, PMOs for skipping exon 44 have been developing in clinical trials, such as the drug NS-089/NCNP-02. Two exon 53 skipping PMOs, golodirsen and viltolarsen, have received conditional approval for treating patients due to their ability to restore dystrophin protein expression. Although promising, further development of exon-skipping technology is needed for patients to have more therapeutic benefit. This chapter describes evaluation methods of exon 44 and 53 skipping PMOs in immortalized DMD patient-derived skeletal muscle cells. We introduce how to quantify exon-skipping efficiencies and dystrophin rescue levels represented by RT-PCR and western blotting, respectively. The screening methods using immortalized patient myotubes can serve to find exon-skipping PMO drug candidates."

We compared the efficacy and safety of sotorasib with a standard-of-care treatment in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with the KRASG12C mutation who had been previously treated with other anticancer drugs. METHODS: We conducted a randomised, open-label phase 3 trial at 148 centres in 22 countries. We recruited patients aged at least 18 years with KRASG12C-mutated advanced NSCLC, who progressed after previous platinum-based chemotherapy and a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor. Key exclusion criteria included new or progressing untreated brain lesions or symptomatic brain lesions, previously identified oncogenic driver mutation other than KRASG12C for which an approved therapy is available (eg EGFR or ALK), previous treatment with docetaxel (neoadjuvant or adjuvant docetaxel was allowed if the tumour did not progress within 6 months after the therapy was terminated), previous treatment with a direct KRASG12C inhibitor, systemic anticancer therapy within 28 days of study day 1, and therapeutic or palliative radiation therapy within 2 weeks of treatment initiation. We randomly assigned (1:1) patients to oral sotorasib (960 mg once daily) or intravenous docetaxel (75 mg/m2 once every 3 weeks) in an open-label manner using interactive response technology. Randomisation was stratified by number of previous lines of therapy in advanced disease (1 vs 2 vs >2), ethnicity (Asian vs non-Asian), and history of CNS metastases (present or absent). Treatment continued until an independent central confirmation of disease progression, intolerance, initiation of another anticancer therapy, withdrawal of consent, or death, whichever occurred first. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival, which was assessed by a blinded, independent central review in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed in all treated patients. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04303780, and is active but no longer recruiting. FINDINGS: Between June 4, 2020, and April 26, 2021, 345 patients were randomly assigned to receive sotorasib (n=171 [50%]) or docetaxel (n=174 [50%]). 169 (99%) patients in the sotorasib group and 151 (87%) in the docetaxel group received at least one dose. After a median follow-up of 17 7 months (IQR 16 4-20 1), the study met its primary endpoint of a statistically significant increase in the progression-free survival for sotorasib, compared with docetaxel (median progression-free survival 5 6 months [95% CI 4 3-7 8] vs 4 5 months [3 0-5 7]; hazard ratio 0 66 [0 51-0 86]; p=0 0017). Sotorasib was well tolerated, with fewer grade 3 or worse (n=56 [33%] vs n=61 [40%]) and serious treatment-related adverse events compared with docetaxel (n=18 [11%] vs n=34 [23%]). For sotorasib, the most common treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or worse were diarrhoea (n= 20 [12%]), alanine aminotransferase increase (n=13 [8%]), and aspartate aminotransferase increase (n=9 [5%]). For docetaxel, the most common treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or worse were neutropenia (n=13 [9%]), fatigue (n=9 [6%]), and febrile neutropenia (n=8 [5%]). INTERPRETATION: Sotorasib significantly increased progression-free survival and had a more favourable safety profile, compared with docetaxel, in patients with advanced NSCLC with the KRASG12C mutation and who had been previously treated with other anticancer drugs.

BACKGROUND: Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is a rare neurodegenerative disease that belongs to the group of human spongiform encephalopathies and usually affects elderly people. It is clinically characterized by rapidly progressive dementia and development of neurological symptoms, such as myoclonus or ataxia. Until now, neuroradiologic investigations have only played a minor role in establishing the clinical diagnosis of CJD, and they are often performed to exclude differential diagnoses. SETTING: A university hospital, base of the German National Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Surveillance Study. METHODS AND PATIENTS: In this study, MRIs from suspected cases of CJD were examined by one investigator blinded to the diagnosis. Patients were classified according to the established clinical and neuropathological criteria. RESULTS: Bilateral symmetric, high signal intensities on T2-weighted MRIs were present in the basal ganglia of 109 (67%) of 162 patients with CJD. In the control group, which consisted of non-CJD dementia patients, these abnormalities on T2-weighted MRIs were found in 4 (7%) of 58 patients. This corresponds to a high specificity in the differential diagnosis of CJD. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that MRI is a useful and valuable tool with reasonable sensitivity (67%) and high specificity (93%) and should be considered as an additional cornerstone in the clinical diagnosis of CJD."

MITF was recently shown to reside downstream of the canonical Wnt pathway during melanocyte differentiation from pluripotent neural crest cells in zebrafish as well as in mammalian melanocyte lineage cells. Although expression of many melanocytic/pigmentation markers is lost in human melanoma, MITF expression remains intact, even in unpigmented tumors, suggesting a role for MITF beyond its role in differentiation. A significant fraction of primary human melanomas exhibit deregulation (via aberrant nuclear accumulation) of beta-catenin, leading us to examine its role in melanoma growth and survival. Here, we show that beta-catenin is a potent mediator of growth for melanoma cells in a manner dependent on its downstream target MITF. Moreover, suppression of melanoma clonogenic growth by disruption of beta-catenin-T-cell transcription factor/LEF is rescued by constitutive MITF. This rescue occurs largely through a prosurvival mechanism. Thus, beta-catenin regulation of MITF expression represents a tissue-restricted pathway that significantly influences the growth and survival behavior of this notoriously treatment-resistant neoplasm."

Overexpression of the RPS19 transgene increased the number of erythroid colonies by almost 3-fold. High expression levels of the RPS19 transgene improved erythroid colony-forming ability substantially whereas low expression levels had no effect. Overexpression of RPS19 had no detrimental effect on granulocyte-macrophage colony formation.

Nevertheless, until now it has not been possible to show that MITF regulates the expression of the endogenous tyrosinase or Tyrp1. Further, a direct involvement of MITF in the regulation of melanin synthesis, a key parameter of melanocyte differentiation, remains to be demonstrated. In the present report, using recombinant adenovirus encoding the wild-type or a dominant negative form of MITF, as well as stable cell lines expressing tetracycline inducible wild-type MITF, we reassessed the role of MITF in melanocyte differentiation and in the regulation of melanin synthesis. Immunofluorescence studies, as well as Western blot analyses, show that infection of B16 mouse melanoma cells or human melanocytes with adenovirus encoding wild-type MITF does not increase the expression of the endogenous melanogenic enzymes. However, infection with the MITF dominant negative mutant inhibits the expression of endogenous tyrosinase and Tyrp1 proteins and blocks cAMP-induced melanin synthesis. Thus, MITF is required but does not seem to be sufficient to induce the expression of melanogenic enzymes and we show for the first time a direct involvement of MITF in the regulation of melanin pigment synthesis. As a whole, our data point to the existence of still unknown regulatory mechanisms that co-operate or synergize with MITF to control melanogenic gene expression and melanin synthesis. The identification of such mechanisms will greatly improve our understanding of the melanocyte differentiation processes."

They are characterized by abnormally enlarged and often leaking capillary cavities without intervening neural parenchyma. Some are clinically silent, whereas others cause seizures, intracerebral haemorrhage or focal neurological deficits. These vascular malformations can arise sporadically or may be inherited as an autosomal dominant condition with incomplete penetrance. At least 45% of families affected with cerebral cavernous malformations harbour a mutation in Krev interaction trapped-1 (Krit1) gene (cerebral cavernous malformation gene-1, CCM1). This gene contains 16 coding exons which encode a 736-amino acid protein containing three ankyrin repeats and a FERM domain. Neither the CCM1 pathogenetic mechanisms nor the function of the Krit1 protein are understood so far, although several hypotheses have been inferred from the predicted consequences of Krit1 mutations as well as from the identification of Krit1 as a binding partner of Rap1A, ICAP1A and microtubules. Here, we report the identification of Krit1B, a novel Krit1 isoform characterized by the alternative splicing of the 15th coding exon. We show that the Krit1B splice isoform is widely expressed in mouse cell lines and tissues, whereas its expression is highly restricted in human. In addition, we developed a real-time PCR strategy to accurately quantify the relative ratio of the two Krit1 alternative transcripts in different tissues, demonstrating a Krit1B/Krit1A ratio up to 20% in mouse thymus, but significantly lower ratios in other tissues. Bioinformatic analysis using exon/gene-prediction, comparative alignment and structure analysis programs supported the existence of Krit1 alternative transcripts lacking the 15th coding exon and showed that the splicing out of this exon occurs outside of potentially important Krit1 structural domains but in a region required for association with Rap1A, suggesting a subtle, yet important effect on the protein function. Our results indicate that maintenance of a proper ratio between Krit1A and Krit1B could be functionally relevant and suggest that the novel Krit1B isoform might expand our understanding of the role of Krit1 in CCM1 pathogenesis."

However, owing to the short half-life of annexin V, multiple injections of the radiotracer are necessary to capture the peak apoptotic activity. In this study, we evaluated the imaging properties of an (111)In-labeled, long-circulating annexin V. METHODS: Both polyethylene glycol (PEG) and the metal chelator diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) were simultaneously introduced to annexin V or ovalbumin through the use of a heterofunctional PEG precursor. Imaging studies were performed in mice bearing subcutaneously inoculated human mammary MDA-MB-468 tumors. The mice were treated with poly(L-glutamic acid)-paclitaxel, monoclonal antibody C225, or a combination of poly(L-glutamic acid)-paclitaxel and C225, followed by intravenous injection of (111)In-DTPA-PEG-annexin V. Images were acquired 48 h after the injection of the radiotracer. Autoradiography and TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling) staining were performed on adjacent tumor slices for the localization of apoptotic cells. The imaging properties of unPEGylated annexin V and PEGylated ovalbumin were also determined to permit assessment of the specificity of (111)In-DTPA-PEG-annexin V. RESULTS: Tumor apoptotic index increased from 1.67% +/- 0.31% at baseline to 7.60% +/- 0.72% and 11.07% +/- 1.81%, respectively, 4 d after treatment with poly(L-glutamic acid)-paclitaxel or combined poly(L-glutamic acid)-paclitaxel and C225. Tumor uptake (percentage of injected dose per gram of tumor [%ID/g]) of PEGylated (111)In-DTPA-PEG-annexin 4 d after treatment was significantly higher in tumors treated with poly(L-glutamic acid)-paclitaxel (10.76 +/- 1.38 %ID/g; P = 0.001) and with combined poly(L-glutamic acid)-paclitaxel and C225 (9.84 +/- 2.51 %ID/g; P = 0.029) than in nontreated tumors (6.14 +/- 0.67 %ID/g), resulting in enhanced visualization of treated tumors. (111)In-DTPA-PEG-annexin V distributed into the central zone of tumors, whereas (111)In-DTPA-annexin V was largely confined to the tumor periphery. Furthermore, uptake of (111)In-DTPA-PEG-annexin V by tumors correlated with apoptotic index (r = 0.87, P = 0.02). Increase in tumor uptake of the nonspecific PEGylated protein (111)In-DTPA-PEG-ovalbumin was also observed after poly(L-glutamic acid)-paclitaxel treatment (55.6%), although this increase was less than that observed for (111)In-DTPA-PEG-annexin V (96.7%). CONCLUSION: Increased uptake of and improved visualization with (111)In-DTPA-PEG-annexin V in solid tumors after chemotherapy are mediated through both specific binding to apoptotic cells and nonspecific retention of macromolecular contrast agents in the tumors. (111)In-Labeled, PEGylated annexin V may be used to assess tumor response to chemotherapy."

Curcumin induced apoptosis in both the lung cancer cell lines. A decrease in expression of p53, bcl-2, and bcl-X(L) was observed after 12 h exposure of 40 microM curcumin. Bak and Caspase genes remained unchanged up to 60 microM curcumin but showed decrease in expression levels at 80-160 microM. The data also suggest a p53 independent induction of apoptosis in lung cancer cells."

The transcription factors that determine the decision between lymphoid and myeloid cell fates, and the underlying mechanisms, remain largely unknown. Here, we report that enforced expression of C/EBPalpha and C/EBPbeta in differentiated B cells leads to their rapid and efficient reprogramming into macrophages. C/EBPs induce these changes by inhibiting the B cell commitment transcription factor Pax5, leading to the downregulation of its target CD19, and synergizing with endogenous PU.1, an ETS family factor, leading to the upregulation of its target Mac-1 and other myeloid markers. The two processes can be uncoupled, since, in PU.1-deficient pre-B cells, C/EBPs induce CD19 downregulation but not Mac-1 activation. Our observations indicate that C/EBPalpha and beta remodel the transcription network of B cells into that of macrophages through a series of parallel and sequential changes that require endogenous PU.1."

In the present study, they present their initial experience in using the HOQ to quantify the health status in a typical cohort of children with hydrocephalus. METHODS: The mothers of children with hydrocephalus completed the HOQ and, with the child's attending surgeon, provided a global rating of their children's health. An exploratory analysis was performed using a multivariate analysis of variance (ANOVA) to determine which variables might be associated with worse health status. The mothers of 80 children, ranging in age from 5 to 17 years, participated in the study. The mean HOQ Overall Health score was 0.68, a value estimated to be equivalent to a mean health utility score of 0.77. The global health ratings provided by the mothers and the surgeons were moderately correlated with the HOQ scores (Pearson correlations 0.58 and 0.57, respectively). Results of the multivariate ANOVA indicated that the presence of epilepsy was strongly associated with a worse health status (p < 0.0001, F-test). CONCLUSIONS: The health status of a typical sample of children with hydrocephalus was measured using the HOQ. The only consistently significant association with health status found was the presence of epilepsy."

The procedure delivers two sperm fractions: annexin V-negative (nonapoptotic) and annexin V-positive (apoptotic). Our aim was to determine whether the sperm fertilizing potential can be improved by selecting a nonapoptotic fraction using MACS. Semen samples (n = 35) were subjected to separation on a density gradient followed by MACS. Extent of apoptosis was assessed by measuring levels of activated caspase 3 using fluorescein-labeled inhibitors of caspase, alterations in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) using a lipophilic cationic dye, and DNA fragmentation using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated fluorescein-dUTP nick end labeling assay. The sperm fertilization potential was assessed using hamster oocyte penetration assay and hamster oocyte-intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Annexin V-negative sperm displayed superior quality in terms of high motility, low caspase 3 activation, MMP integrity, and small extent of DNA fragmentation. Annexin V-negative sperm demonstrated higher oocyte penetration capacity but comparable sperm chromatin decondensation (SCD) following ICSI. Conversely, the annexin V-positive sperm presented with poor quality and fertilization potential. The oocyte penetration rate was negatively correlated with apoptotic marker expression, whereas SCD following ICSI was only associated with apoptosis on sperm-damaged membranes. We conclude that apoptosis appears to impact sperm-oocyte penetration rate; however, it does not seem to affect early stages of fertilization such as SCD in spermatozoa of healthy donors. The selection of nonapoptotic sperm by MACS may be used to enhance results of in vitro fertilization by increasing sperm-oocyte penetration."

Here we show, by both 2D gel analyses and chromatin immunoprecipitations (ChIP), that there exists a second level of global control mediated by the intra-S-phase checkpoint protein complex of Tof1p and Csm3p that protect stalled forks at Ter sites against the activity of the Rrm3p helicase (\"sweepase\"). The sweepase tends to release arrested forks presumably by the transient displacement of the Ter-bound Fob1p. Consistent with this mechanism, very few replication forks were arrested at the natural replication termini in the absence of the two checkpoint proteins. In the absence of the Rrm3p helicase, there was a slight enhancement of fork arrest at the Ter sites. Simultaneous deletions of the TOF1 (or CSM3), and the RRM3 genes restored fork arrest by removing both the fork-releasing and fork-protection activities. Other genes such as MRC1, WSS1, and PSY2 that are also involved in the MRC1 checkpoint pathway were not involved in this global control. This observation suggests that Tof1p-Csm3p function differently from MRC1 and the other above-mentioned genes. This mechanism is not restricted to the natural Ter sites but was also observed at fork arrest caused by the meeting of a replication fork with transcription approaching from the opposite direction."

METHODS: A medial optic canal decompression was performed on 5 cadaveric optic canals within 12 hours of death. Two canals were decompressed under direct visualization and 3 were decompressed by a transphenoidal endoscopic approach. The optic canal was subsequently removed en bloc, beginning at the annulus of Zinn and extending to the optic chiasm. Each specimen was processed and examined grossly. Serial coronal step sections of the entire length of the intracanalicular optic nerve were assessed histologically. RESULTS: Microscopic examination of the intracanalicular portion of optic nerve revealed incision in an extraocular muscle at the annulus, incomplete bone removal, fraying of the dural sheath, incomplete dural/arachnoid release, and incision in the pia and optic nerve. CONCLUSIONS: Transphenoidal medial wall decompression of the optic nerve canal with dural sheath opening may induce physical damage to the nerve. Any hypothetical value in dural-arachnoid sheath opening must be weighed against the potential for harm to the optic nerve caused by the surgical intervention."

Here, we report that tastin is also required for spindle assembly during mitosis. Tastin protein levels peaked in the G(2)/M phase and abruptly declined after cell division. Microscopy showed that tastin is primarily localized on the microtubules, centrosomes, and the mitotic spindle during the cell cycle. Tastin interacted with the dynein intermediate chain, p150(Glued), and gamma-tubulin in addition to Tctex-1 (the light chain of dynein). Overexpression of tastin led to monopolar spindle formation, whereas loss of tastin expression caused profound mitotic block and preferentially induced multipolar spindles. These multipolar spindles were generated through a loss of cohesion in mitotic centrosomes; specifically, tastin depletion caused the fragmentation of pericentrosomal material and the splitting of the centrioles at the spindle poles. Tastin depletion induced centrosome abnormalities exclusively during mitosis and required both microtubule integrity and Eg5 activity. However, tastin depletion did not disrupt the organization of spindle poles, as revealed by localization of nuclear mitotic apparatus protein (NuMA) and the p150(Glued) component of dynactin. These data indicate that the major function of tastin during mitosis is to maintain the structural and dynamic features of centrosomes, thereby contributing to spindle bipolarity."

This study evaluated the sensitivity of detection of the HLA-B*5701 allele as a marker of ABC HSRs in both white and black patients, using skin patch testing to supplement clinical diagnosis. METHODS: White and black patients, identified through chart review, were classified as having received a diagnosis of an ABC HSR based on clinical findings only (a clinically suspected ABC HSR) or based on clinical findings and a positive skin patch test result (an immunologically confirmed [IC] ABC HSR). Control subjects were racially matched subjects who tolerated ABC for >/=12 weeks without experiencing an ABC HSR. Patients and control subjects were tested for the presence of HLA-B*5701. Sensitivity, specificity, and odds ratios for the detection of HLA-B*5701 as a marker for an ABC HSR were calculated for white and black participants. RESULTS: Forty-two (32.3%) of 130 white patients and 5 (7.2%) of 69 black patients who met the criteria for clinically suspected HSRs had IC HSRs. All 42 white patients with IC HSRs were HLA-B*5701 positive (sensitivity, 100%; odds ratio, 1945; 95% confidence interval, 110-34,352). Among all white patients with clinically suspected HSRs, sensitivity was 44% (57 of 130 patients tested positive for HLA-B*5701); specificity among white control subjects was 96%. Five of 5 black patients with IC HSRs were HLA-B*5701 positive (sensitivity, 100%; odds ratio, 900; 95% confidence interval, 38-21,045). Among black patients with clinically suspected HSRs, the sensitivity was 14% (10 of 69 tested positive for HLA-B*5701); specificity among black control subjects was 99%. CONCLUSIONS: Although IC ABC HSRs are uncommon in black persons, the 100% sensitivity of HLA-B*5701 as a marker for IC ABC HSRs in both US white and black patients suggests similar implications of the association between HLA-B*5701 positivity and risk of ABC HSRs in both races."

The beneficial effect of the deletion 32 allele of the CCR5 coreceptor on the natural history of HIV infection and, to a certain extent, on treatment response is well known. The bases of immune reconstitution after initiation of antiretroviral therapy, although the subject of intense study, are probably multifactorial and polygenetic and consequently conclusions with clear applicability to clinical practice are currently lacking. Among the risks, no significant progress has been made in lipodystrophy. The origin of dyslipidemia associated with antiretroviral treatment and the excess cardiovascular risk conferred by some antiretroviral drugs is probably polygenetic and, at present, poorly defined. The genetic bases of efavirenz-induced neurological toxicity and of hyperbilirubinemia secondary to atazanavir are fairly well known, although their application in daily clinical practice has not been adequately assessed. Some aspects that help to understand the molecular bases of hypersensitivity reaction to nevirapine and of nevirapine-induced hepatotoxicity have been described but are not applicable in most cases and consequently further studies are required. Some data correlate tenofovir-induced renal toxicity with genetic variations in some transport proteins. The most significant advance for clinical practice is the correlation between the presence of the HLA-B*5701 allele and hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir. In particular, one clinical trial with a large number of patients from distinct ethnic groups found that the probability of not developing hypersensitivity reaction (immunologically confirmed) was 100% if the patient was HLA-B*5701-negative. These data suggest the need to implement this test in daily clinical practice."

The present study examined whether this mechanism generalizes to other antidepressants and also is evident for the serotonin transporter (SERT). Treatment of rats for 14 days with 20 mg/kg per day protriptyline or 7.5 mg/kg per day sertraline reduced NET and SERT expression, respectively, in cerebral cortex and hippocampus; these treatments also induced a persistent antidepressant-like effect on forced-swim behavior. Increased serotonergic neurotransmission likely mediated the behavioral effect of sertraline, as it was blocked by inhibition of serotonin synthesis with p-chlorophenylalanine; a parallel effect was observed previously for desipramine and noradrenergic neurotransmission. Treatment with 20 mg/kg per day reboxetine for 42, but not 14, days reduced NET expression; antidepressant-like effects on behavior were observed for both treatment durations. Treatment for 14 days with 70 mg/kg per day venlafaxine, which inhibits both the NET and SERT, or 10 mg/kg per day phenelzine, a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, produced antidepressant-like effects on behavior without altering NET or SERT expression. For all drugs tested, reductions of NET and SERT protein were not accompanied by reduced NET or SERT mRNA in locus coeruleus or dorsal raphe nucleus, respectively. Overall, the present results suggest an important, though not universal, role for NET and SERT regulation in the long-term behavioral effects of antidepressants. Understanding the mechanisms underlying transporter regulation in vivo may suggest novel targets for the development of antidepressant drugs."

TAKE HOME MESSAGE: In Phase I/II randomized control trials, in patients with new onset T1D, teplizumab slowed the rate of loss of beta-cell function over 2 years of follow-up. Treated patients had better glycemic control and lower insulin requirements. Adverse events so far are mild and of limited duration. Phase III clinical trials are underway to confirm these results and to determine if two courses of drug have greater efficacy in arresting loss of beta-cell function."

The design of the model architecture and the algorithms for parameter estimation and decoding are extremely important for improve the performance of HMM. In topology prediction of transmembrane beta-barrels proteins (TMBs), the Baum-Welch algorithm is widely adapted for HMM training but usually leads to a sub-optimal model in practice. In addition, all the existing HMM-based predictors are only designed to model the transmembrane segment without a submodel to model the signal peptide (SP) for full-length sequences. It is not convenient for users to investigate the structures of full-length TMB sequences. RESULTS: We present here, an HMM that combine a transmembrane barrel submodel and an SP submodel for both topology and SP predictions. A new genetic algorithm (GA) is presented here to training the model, at the same time the Posterior-Viterbi algorithm is adopted for decoding. A dataset including 33 TMBs that is the most so far in literature are collected for model training and testing. Results of self-consistency and jackknife tests shows the GA has better global performance than the Baum-Welch algorithm. Results of jackknife tests show that this method performs better than all well known existing methods for topology predictions. Furthermore, it provides a function to predict SP in full-length TMBs sequences with fairish accuracy. CONCLUSION: We show that our combined HMM-based method is a better choice for TMB topology prediction, which implements topology predictions with higher accuracy and additional SP predictions for full-length TMB sequences."

Although impressive advances in treatment and reduction in mortality have marked heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), the mortality in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), which accounts for nearly half of heart failure cases, has remained unchanged. This may be because of the lack of consistent diagnostic criteria and limited understanding of the pathophysiology of HFpEF, and thus appropriate treatment options. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent data suggest that HFpEF consists of multiple abnormalities rather than a distinct entity. Advances in testing have improved diagnosis, but further validation is required. The discoveries of new pathological abnormalities have identified potential new drug therapy targets. Traditional agents with strong evidence in HFrEF have proved unsuccessful in HFpEF. Newer agents such as angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor, sildenafil, and ivabradine have demonstrated benefits without improving mortality. Lastly, as HFpEF patients are older with more comorbidities, alternate endpoints to survival benefit should be considered. SUMMARY: Although enormous strides have been made in understanding the pathophysiology and refining the diagnostic criteria of HFpEF, there is currently no pharmacological therapy with mortality benefits. Further characterization and the recruitment of more homogeneous patient populations will be essential to identify effective treatments."

BACKGROUND: Rivaroxaban is noninferior to warfarin for preventing stroke in atrial fibrillation patients. Concerns exist regarding possible increased risk of stroke and non-central nervous system (CNS) thromboembolic events early after discontinuation of rivaroxaban. METHODS: We undertook a post-hoc analysis of data from the ROCKET AF (Rivaroxaban Once-Daily, Oral, Direct Factor Xa Inhibition Compared With Vitamin K Antagonism for Prevention of Stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation, n = 14,624) for stroke or non-CNS embolism within 30 days after temporary interruptions of 3 days or more, early permanent study drug discontinuation, and end-of-study transition to open-label therapy. RESULTS: Stroke and non-CNS embolism occurred at similar rates after temporary interruptions (rivaroxaban: n = 9, warfarin: n = 8, 6.20 vs. 5.05/100 patient-years, hazard ratio [HR]: 1.28, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.49 to 3.31, p = 0.62) and after early permanent discontinuation (rivaroxaban: n = 42, warfarin: n = 36, 25.60 vs. 23.28/100 patient-years, HR: 1.10, 95% CI: 0.71 to 1.72, p = 0.66). Patients transitioning to open-label therapy at the end of the study had more strokes with rivaroxaban (n = 22) versus warfarin (n = 6, 6.42 vs. 1.73/100 patient-years, HR: 3.72, 95% CI: 1.51 to 9.16, p = 0.0044) and took longer to reach a therapeutic international normalized ratio with rivaroxaban versus warfarin.

CONCLUSIONS: In atrial fibrillation patients who temporarily or permanently discontinued anticoagulation, the risk of stroke or non-CNS embolism was similar with rivaroxaban or warfarin. An increased risk of stroke and non-CNS embolism was observed in rivaroxaban-treated patients compared with warfarin-treated patients after the end of the study, underscoring the importance of therapeutic anticoagulation coverage during such a transition."

However, some cognitively normal older individuals harbor neural injury similar to patients with AD, without concurrent Abeta burden. Such findings challenge the proposed sequence and suggest that Abeta-independent precursors underlie AD-typical neurodegenerative patterns. OBJECTIVE To examine relationships between Abeta and non-Abeta factors as well as neurodegeneration within AD regions in cognitively normal older adults. The study quantified neurodegenerative abnormalities using imaging biomarkers and examined cross-sectional relationships with Abeta deposition; white matter lesions (WMLs), a marker of cerebrovascular disease; and cognitive functions. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional study in a community-based convenience sample of 72 cognitively normal older individuals (mean [SD] age, 74.9 [5.7] years; 48 women; mean [SD] 17.0 [1.9] years of education) of the Berkeley Aging Cohort. INTERVENTION: Each individual underwent a standardized neuropsychological test session, magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomography scanning. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: For each individual, 3 AD-sensitive neurodegeneration biomarkers were measured: hippocampal volume, glucose metabolism, and gray matter thickness, the latter 2 sampled from cortical AD-affected regions. To quantify neurodegenerative abnormalities, each biomarker was age adjusted, dichotomized into a normal or abnormal status (using cutoff thresholds derived from an independent AD sample), and summarized into 0, 1, or more than 1 abnormal neurodegenerative biomarker. Degree and topographic patterns of neurodegenerative abnormalities were assessed and their relationships with cognitive functions, WML volume, and Abeta deposition (quantified using carbon 11-labeled Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography). RESULTS: Of our cognitively normal elderly individuals, 40% (n = 29) displayed at least 1 abnormal neurodegenerative biomarker, 26% (n = 19) of whom had no evidence of elevated Pittsburgh compound B retention. In those people who were classified as having abnormal cortical thickness, degree and topographic specificity of neurodegenerative abnormalities were similar to patients with AD. Accumulation of neurodegenerative abnormalities was related to poor memory and executive functions as well as larger WML volumes but not elevated Pittsburgh compound B retention. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Our study confirms that a substantial proportion of cognitively normal older adults harbor neurodegeneration, without Abeta burden. Associations of neurodegenerative abnormalities with cerebrovascular disease and cognitive performance indicate that neurodegenerative pathology can emerge through non-Abeta pathways within regions most affected by AD."

Early clinical results in CLL with other reversible and irreversible BTK inhibitors have been less promising, however, raising the question of whether BTK kinase activity is an important target of ibrutinib and also in CLL. To determine the role of BTK in CLL, we used patient samples and the Emu-TCL1 (TCL1) transgenic mouse model of CLL, which results in spontaneous leukemia development. Inhibition of BTK in primary human CLL cells by small interfering RNA promotes apoptosis. Inhibition of BTK kinase activity through either targeted genetic inactivation or ibrutinib in the TCL1 mouse significantly delays the development of CLL, demonstrating that BTK is a critical kinase for CLL development and expansion and thus an important target of ibrutinib. Collectively, our data confirm the importance of kinase-functional BTK in CLL. "

In this study, the influence of dimebon on mitochondria was investigated to gain a better understanding of the neuroprotective effects of this drug. Here, we demonstrate that dimebon enhances the resistance of the isolated rat brain and liver mitochondria to the induction of mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) by calcium ions even in the presence of atractyloside, a MPT pore (MPTP) opener, but is ineffective against atractyloside-induced mitochondria swelling. Unlike cyclosporine A (CsA), a MPTP inhibitor, Dimebon does not influence the adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) conformational changes and is not able to prevent the MPT of de-energized mitochondria. Using three different assays, and using amyloid-beta peptide for inducing mitochondrial toxicity, we show that the influence of dimebon on the calcium retention capacity (CRC) of mitochondria depends on the mode of calcium addition. No obvious influence of dimebon on CRC was observed under the conditions of calcium infusion in the pump mode but the increase of CRC of rat brain mitochondria was observed when calcium was added in the bolus mode; the addition of calcium in the single pulse mode led to the increase of the lag period of calcium efflux from mitochondria. From these studies it is shown that dimebon is effective against amyloid-beta (Abeta) potentiated mitochondrial swelling and decrease of calcium retention capacity (CRC) of the brain mitochondria. "

Sertindole , first withdrawn from the market for cardiovascular safety concerns, is currently available in many countries. It has high affinity for dopamine D2, serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C and a1-adrenergic receptors, and a low potential for extrapyramidal symptoms. AREAS COVERED: The pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, safety and tolerability, and cost-effectiveness of sertindole are covered in this article, based on a literature review (PubMed) from 1990 to 2014. EXPERT OPINION: The reviewed studies suggest a beneficial effect of sertindole on positive, negative and cognitive symptoms, and on relapse prevention. Although generally well tolerated, sertindole is associated with a dose-related QT-interval prolongation; thus, its administration requires electrocardiogram screening and monitoring. The presence of congenital long QT syndrome, prolongated QTc at baseline, cardiac disease and drug interactions should be carefully considered before prescribing sertindole. Further direct 'head-to-head' comparisons with other second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs), trials on special populations and further clarification on cardiac safety are needed to better define the role of sertindole in the treatment of schizophrenia."

Despite multimodal therapies, almost all GBM recur within a narrow margin around the initial resected lesion. Thus, novel therapeutic intensification strategies must target both, the population of dispersed tumor cells around the cavity and the postoperative microenvironment. Intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) is a pragmatic and effective approach to sterilize the margins from persistent tumor cells, abrogate post-injury proliferative stimuli and to bridge the therapeutic gap between surgery and radiochemotherapy. Therefore, we have set up INTRAGO, a phase I/II dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of IORT added to standard therapy in newly diagnosed GBM. In contrast to previous approaches, the study involves the application of isotropic low-energy (kV) x-rays delivered by spherical applicators, providing optimal irradiation properties to the resection cavity. METHODS/DESIGN: INTRAGO includes patients aged 50 years or older with a Karnofsky performance status of at least 50% and a histologically confirmed (frozen sections) supratentorial GBM. Safety and tolerability (i.e., the maximum tolerated dose, MTD) will be assessed using a classical 3 + 3 dose-escalation design. Dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) are wound healing deficits or infections requiring surgical intervention, IORT-related cerebral bleeding or ischemia, symptomatic brain necrosis requiring surgical intervention and early termination of external beam radiotherapy (before the envisaged dose of 60 Gy) due to radiotoxicity. Secondary end points are progression-free and overall survival. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study is registered with clinicaltrials.gov, number: NCT02104882 (Registration Date: 03/26/2014)."

However, the molecular mechanisms by which SOX10 guides the appropriate gene expression programs necessary to promote the melanocyte lineage are not fully understood. Here we employ genetic and epigenomic analysis approaches to uncover novel genomic targets and previously unappreciated molecular roles of SOX10 in melanocytes. Through global analysis of SOX10-binding sites and epigenetic characteristics of chromatin states, we uncover an extensive catalog of SOX10 targets genome-wide. Our findings reveal that SOX10 predominantly engages 'open' chromatin regions and binds to distal regulatory elements, including novel and previously known melanocyte enhancers. Integrated chromatin occupancy and transcriptome analysis suggest a role for SOX10 in both transcriptional activation and repression to regulate functionally distinct classes of genes. We demonstrate that distinct epigenetic signatures and cis-regulatory sequence motifs predicted to bind putative co-regulatory transcription factors define SOX10-activated and SOX10-repressed target genes. Collectively, these findings uncover a central role of SOX10 as a global regulator of gene expression in the melanocyte lineage by targeting diverse regulatory pathways. "

Here we propose a model of stem cell differentiation in which cell-fate determinants work synergistically to determine different cellular identities, and reside in a class of GRN motifs known as feedback loops. Based on this model, we develop a computational method that can systematically predict cell-fate determinants and their GRN motifs. The method was able to recapitulate experimentally validated cell-fate determinants, and validation of two predicted cell-fate determinants confirmed that overexpression of ESR1 and RUNX2 in mouse neural stem cells induces neuronal and astrocyte differentiation, respectively.

Accumulative data indicate that curcumin may induce cancer cell death. However, the detailed mechanism underlying its pro-apoptotic and anti-cancer effects remains to be elucidated. In the present study, we examined the signaling pathways triggered by curcumin, specifically, the exact molecular mechanisms of curcumin-induced apoptosis in highly metastatic human prostate cancer cells. The effect of curcumin was evaluated using for the first time in prostate cancer, a gel-free shotgun quantitative proteomic analysis coupled with Tandem Mass Tag isobaric labeling-based-signaling networks. Results were confirmed at the gene expression level by qRT-PCR and at the protein expression level by western blot and flow cytometry. Our findings revealed that curcumin induced an Endoplasmic Reticulum stress-mediated apoptosis in PC3. The mechanisms by which curcumin promoted cell death in these cells were associated with cell cycle arrest, increased reactive oxygen species, autophagy and the Unfolded Protein Response. Furthermore, the upregulation of ER stress was measured using key indicators of ER stress: Glucose-Regulated Protein 78, Inositol-Requiring Enzyme 1 alpha, Protein Disulfide isomerase and Calreticulin. Chronic ER stress induction was concomitant with the upregulation of pro-apoptotic markers (caspases 3,9,12) and Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase. The downregulated proteins include anti-apoptotic and anti-tumor markers, supporting their curcumin-induced pro-apoptotic role in prostate cancer cells. Taken together, these data suggest that curcumin may serve as a promising anticancer agent by inducing a chronic ER stress mediated cell death and activation of cell cycle arrest, UPR, autophagy and oxidative stress responses."

Emerging evidence has demonstrated that cancer stem cells (CSCs) play important roles in the tumorigenesis and progression of HCC. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the stemness maintenance of CSCs remain largely unknown. In the present study, through real-time PCR, western blotting, luciferase assays, RNA immunoprecipitation, and in vitro and in vivo assays, we demonstrated that miR-217 expression was markedly increased in HCC tissues and cells. Overexpression of miR-217 promoted, while silencing miR-217 suppressed, the fraction of the side population and the expression of cancer stem cell factors in vitro and tumorigenicity in vivo in HCC cells. Our findings further demonstrated that miR-217 promoted the CSC-like phenotype via dickkopf-1 (DKK1) targeting, resulting in constitutive activation of Wnt signaling. Moreover, the stimulatory effects of miR-217 on stem cell properties and Wnt signaling were antagonized by the upregulation of DKK1 in miR-217-overexpressing cells. Conversely, the inhibitory effects of silencing miR-217 on stem cell properties and Wnt signaling were reversed by the downregulation of DKK1 in miR-217-downregulated cells. Therefore, our results indicate that miR-217 plays a vital role in the CSC-like phenotypes of HCC cells and may be used as a potential therapeutic target against HCC."

A recent increase in immunocompromised cohorts with solid organ transplants, diabetes mellitus, and other medical conditions have resulted in increased fungal infections including mucormycosis. Our current knowledge about Mucoralean fungi is in its infancy compared to other fungal pathogens, which may be due to lack of robust genetic tools for Mucorales. In this review we summarize recent advances in genetic tools to study the two most prevalent and genetically amenable Mucoralean fungi, Mucor circinelloides and Rhizopus delemar. RECENT FINDINGS: There have been advances made in the study of Mucorales family genetics. These findings include the construction of recyclable markers to manipulate the genome, as well as silencing vectors, and the adaptation of the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system.

Here we review the studies reporting dysfibrinogenemia due to mutations affecting fibrinogen knob A and identified 29 papers. The number of reports on dysfibrinogenemias related to residues Gly17, Pro18, Arg19, and Val20 is 5, 4, 18, and 2, respectively. Dysfibrinogenemias related to residues Gly17, Pro18, and Val20 are exclusively associated with bleeding tendency. However, the clinical picture associated with dysfibrinogenemia related to residue Arg19 varies, with most patients suffering from bleeding tendencies, but also transitory ischemic attacks and retinal thrombosis may occur. The reason for this variation is unclear. To elaborate the genotype-phenotype associations further, we studied a Danish family with knob A-related dysfibrinogenemia caused by the Aalpha Arg19Gly (p.Arg19Gly) mutation using whole-exome sequencing and fibrin structure analysis. Our family is the first reported carrying the p.Arg19Gly mutation combined with one or more single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP)s in FGA, FGB, and/or FGG and increased fibrin fiber thickness and fibrin mass-to-length ratio suffering from pulmonary emboli, suggesting that compound genotypes may contribute to the thrombogenic phenotype of these patients. Our review, accordingly, focuses on significance of SNPs, compound genotypes, and fibrin structure measures affecting the genotype-phenotype associations in fibrinogen knob A mutations."

GRN-associated FTD is characterized by TDP-43 inclusions and neuroinflammation, but how PGRN loss causes disease remains elusive.

Accumulation of myelin debris is also observed in white matter of patients with GRN-associated FTD. In addition, our findings also suggest that PGRN insufficiency in microglia leads to impaired lysosomal-mediated clearance of myelin debris. Finally, Grn KO mice that are deficient in cathepsin D (Ctsd), a key lysosomal enzyme, have augmented myelin debris and increased neuronal TDP-43 pathology. Together, our data strongly imply that PGRN loss affects microglial activation and lysosomal function, resulting in the accumulation of myelin debris and contributing to TDP-43 pathology."

Previous studies have shown that a host-protein signature consisting of TNF-related apoptosis-induced ligand (TRAIL), interferon-gamma-induced protein-10 (IP-10), and C-reactive protein (CRP) can accurately differentiate bacterial from viral infections. METHODS: This prospective, multicentre cohort study, entitled AutoPilot-Dx, aimed to validate signature performance and to estimate its potential impact on antibiotic use across a broad paediatric population (>90 days to 18 years) with respiratory tract infections, or fever without source, at emergency departments and wards in Italy and Germany. Infection aetiology was adjudicated by experts based on clinical and laboratory investigations, including multiplex PCR and follow-up data. RESULTS: In total, 1140 patients were recruited (February 2017-December 2018), of which 1008 met the eligibility criteria (mean age 3.5 years, 41.9% female). Viral and bacterial infections were adjudicated for 628 (85.8%) and 104 (14.2%) children, respectively; 276 patients were assigned an indeterminate reference standard outcome. For the 732 children with reference standard aetiology, the signature discriminated bacterial from viral infections with a sensitivity of 93.7% (95%CI 88.7-98.7), a specificity of 94.2% (92.2-96.1), positive predictive value of 73.0% (65.0-81.0), and negative predictive value of 98.9% (98.0-99.8); in 9.8% the test results were equivocal. The signature performed consistently across different patient subgroups and detected bacterial immune responses in viral PCR-positive patients. CONCLUSIONS: The findings validate the high diagnostic performance of the TRAIL/IP-10/CRP signature in a broad paediatric cohort, and support its potential to reduce antibiotic overuse in children with viral infections."

Multiple signatures of varying size, complexity, and target populations have been described. However, there is little information to indicate how the performance of various published signatures compare to one another. METHODS: This systematic comparison of host gene expression signatures evaluated the performance of 28 signatures, validating them in 4589 subjects from 51 publicly available datasets. Thirteen COVID-specific datasets with 1416 subjects were included in a separate analysis. Individual signature performance was evaluated using the area under the receiving operating characteristic curve (AUC) value. Overall signature performance was evaluated using median AUCs and accuracies. RESULTS: Signature performance varied widely, with median AUCs ranging from 0.55 to 0.96 for bacterial classification and 0.69-0.97 for viral classification. Signature size varied (1-398 genes), with smaller signatures generally performing more poorly (P < 0.04). Viral infection was easier to diagnose than bacterial infection (84% vs. 79% overall accuracy, respectively; P < .001). Host gene expression classifiers performed more poorly in some pediatric populations (3 months-1 year and 2-11 years) compared to the adult population for both bacterial infection (73% and 70% vs. 82%, respectively; P < .001) and viral infection (80% and 79% vs. 88%, respectively; P < .001). We did not observe classification differences based on illness severity as defined by ICU admission for bacterial or viral infections. The median AUC across all signatures for COVID-19 classification was 0.80 compared to 0.83 for viral classification in the same datasets. CONCLUSIONS: In this systematic comparison of 28 host gene expression signatures, we observed differences based on a signature's size and characteristics of the validation population, including age and infection type. However, populations used for signature discovery did not impact performance, underscoring the redundancy among many of these signatures. Furthermore, differential performance in specific populations may only be observable through this type of large-scale validation."

Here we establish histone H2B N-terminus multisite lysine acetylation (H2BNTac) as a signature of active enhancers. H2BNTac prominently marks candidate active enhancers and a subset of promoters and discriminates them from ubiquitously active promoters. Two mechanisms underlie the distinct H2BNTac specificity: (1) unlike H3K27ac, H2BNTac is specifically catalyzed by CBP/p300; (2) H2A-H2B, but not H3-H4, are rapidly exchanged through transcription-induced nucleosome remodeling. H2BNTac-positive candidate enhancers show a high validation rate in orthogonal enhancer activity assays and a vast majority of endogenously active enhancers are marked by H2BNTac and H3K27ac. Notably, H2BNTac intensity predicts enhancer strength and outperforms current state-of-the-art models in predicting CBP/p300 target genes.

Analysis of a delta-like domain.\nTreatment of leukemic cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) induces a short-lived phosphorylation and activation of stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) and cellular differentiation. To investigate whether the rapid deactivation of SAPK results from dephosphorylation by dual-specificity phosphatases (DSPs), we studied regulation of the DSP hVH5 and its murine orthologue M3/6 in K562 human leukemia cells. PMA treatment rapidly induced hVH5 transcripts in these cells, and induced expression of M3/6 completely inhibited PMA-stimulated phosphorylation of SAPK, suggesting a feedback loop to control SAPK activity. Using both stable cell lines and transient transfection we demonstrate that activation of SAPK rapidly stimulated phosphorylation of M3/6. This phosphorylation did not regulate the half-life of total cellular M3/6. hVH5 and M3/6 shares with all sequenced mammalian DSPs an amino acid motif, XILPXLXL, located approximately 80 amino acids from the active site. The hVH5-M3/6 sequence, RILPHLYL, shares significant homology with the SAPK binding site of the c-Jun protein, called the delta domain. This motif was found to be important for DSP function, because deletion of RILPHLYL inhibits SAPK-mediated phosphorylation of M3/6, and deletion of this sequence or mutation of the LYL portion blocks the ability of this phosphatase to dephosphorylate SAPK."

        "text": "The JNK phosphatase M3/6 is inhibited by protein-damaging stress.\nCells respond to stresses such as osmotic shock and heat shock by activating stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs), including c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) [1]. Activation of JNK requires phosphorylation of threonine and tyrosine residues in the TPY activation loop motif [2, 3] and can be reversed by the removal of either phosphate group. Numerous JNK phosphatases including dual-specificity phosphatases [4, 5], have been identified. Many stimuli activate JNK by increasing its rate of phosphorylation; however, JNK dephosphorylation is inhibited in cells after heat shock [6], suggesting that a JNK phosphatase(s) is inactivated. M3/6 is a dual-specificity phosphatase selective for JNK [7, 8]. We have previously expressed M3/6 in the mouse bone marrow cell line BAF3 in order to show that JNK activation by IL-3 is necessary for cell survival and proliferation [9]. Here we report that M3/6 dissociates from JNK and appears in an insoluble fraction after heat shock. These data identify M3/6 as a JNK phosphatase that is inactivated by heat shock and provide a molecular mechanism for the activation of JNK by heat shock."

Using cell and mouse models, we have shown that expanded polyglutamine led to activation of the stress kinase JNK and the transcription factor AP-1, which are implicated in neuronal death. Polyglutamine expansion-induced stress shared common features with protein-damaging stress such as heat shock, because activation of JNK involved inhibition of JNK phosphatase activities. Indeed, expanded polyglutamine impaired the solubility of the dual-specificity JNK phosphatase M3/6. Aggregation of M3/6 by polyglutamine expansion appeared to be indirect, because M3/6 was not recruited into polyglutamine inclusions. The heat shock protein HSP70, which is known to inhibit JNK during the heat shock response, suppressed polyglutamine-mediated aggregation of M3/6 and activation of JNK. Interestingly, levels of HSP70 were down-regulated by polyglutamine expansion. We suggest that reduction of HSP70 by expanded polyglutamine is implicated in aggregation and inhibition of M3/6 and in activation of JNK and AP-1."

Because annexin V has a high affinity for exposed phosphatidylserine on apoptotic cells, radiolabeled annexin V may be used for noninvasive detection of apoptosis in atherosclerotic lesions. METHODS AND RESULTS: Atherosclerotic plaques were produced in 5 rabbits by deendothelialization of the infradiaphragmatic aorta followed by 12 weeks of cholesterol diet; 5 controls were studied without manipulation. Animals were injected with human recombinant annexin V labeled with technetium-99m before imaging. Aortas were explanted for ex vivo imaging, macroautoradiography, and histological characterization of plaque. Radiolabeled annexin V cleared rapidly from the circulation (T1/2, alpha 9 and beta 46 minutes). There was intense uptake of radiolabel within lesions by 2 hours; no uptake was seen in controls. The results were confirmed in the ex vivo imaging of the explanted aorta. Quantitative annexin uptake was 9.3-fold higher in lesion versus nonlesion areas; the lesion-to-blood ratio was 3.0+/-0.37. Annexin uptake paralleled lesion severity and macrophage burden; no correlation was observed with smooth muscle cells. DNA fragmentation staining of apoptotic nuclei was increased in advanced lesions with evolving necrotic cores, predominantly in macrophages; the uptake of radiolabel correlated with the apoptotic index. CONCLUSIONS: Because annexin V clears rapidly from blood and targets apoptotic macrophage population, it should constitute an attractive imaging agent for the noninvasive detection of unstable atherosclerotic plaques."

As cells containing melanogenic enzymes (TRP2) are found in Mitf mouse mutants, it is not clear whether Mitf is a downstream factor or a master regulator of melanocyte differentiation. To further study the role of Mitf in committing cells to the melanocyte lineage, we express Mitf in the cultured quail neuroretina cells. This leads to the induction of two types of pigmented cells: neural crest-derived melanocytes, according to their dendritic morphology, physiology, and gene expression pattern are observed together with pigmented epithelial RPE-like cells. The expression of Mitf is lower in pigmented epithelial RPE-like cells than in neural crest-derived melanocytes. Accordingly, overexpression of Mitf in cultured quail RPE causes cells to develop into neural crest-like pigmented cells. Thus, Mitf is sufficient for the proper differentiation of crest-like pigmented cells from retinal cells and its expression level may determine the type of pigment cell induced."

BMD of lumbar spine and femur was evaluated by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. PRL, testosterone, estradiol, sexual hormone-binding globulin and free androgen and estrogen indexes (FAI and FEI, respectively) were measured in all the subjects. In patients with prolactinoma, mean values of PRL and testosterone were calculated for the 12-month period that preceded the study. The mean T-score of the four sites analyzed by bone densitometry was lower in men with prolactinoma than in controls (p-values: lumbar spine=0.015, femoral neck <0.0001, trochanter=0.037, total femur=0.036), and 55.6% of the former presented osteopenia or osteoporosis at one or more sites (p =0.035). The lumbar spine was the most seriously affected site, where 29.6% had osteopenia and 14.8% had osteoporosis. By the time of BMD determination, significant associations were found between BMD and PRL, testosterone, FAI, estradiol, FEI, and duration of hypogonadism. Considering the period of 12 months that preceded BMD evaluation, trochanter BMD was associated with mean PRL levels, while there was an association between lumbar spine BMD and mean testosterone levels. However, the multiple regression analysis showed that estradiol was the main determinant of BMD. In conclusion, men with prolactinoma have high prevalence of osteopenia and osteoporosis. Bone loss in such patients is associated with hyperprolactinemia and hypogonadism, and mainly influenced by estrogen."

Annexin V (BD Pharmingentrade mark) binds phosphatidylserine that becomes exposed on the cell membrane in apoptotic cells. In vivo detection of apoptotic cells with fluorescently labeled annexin V is an emerging technique that we evaluated for detecting apoptotic germ cells in a mouse model of testicular torsion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Annexin V labeled with an indocyanine fluorophore (bisfunctional succinimidyl ester of cyanine 5.5) (Amersham, Little Chalfont, United Kingdom) was injected intravenously in mice 18 hours after the repair of unilateral 720-degree testicular torsion for 2 hours. Serial fluorescence images were obtained 21, 24, 28 and 42 hours after torsion repair. Relative fluorophore localization was visualized in vivo using an optical small animal imaging system mounted with a filter in near infrared light. Average fluorescence intensity in torsed and sham testes was quantified in images of testes in situ exposed through an abdominal incision and in ex vivo testes. RESULTS: A significant increase in fluorescence intensity was found in images of torsed vs sham operated testes. This was seen in ex vivo, exposed and in vivo testes (215%, 250% and 161%, respectively, p <0.05). Bisfunctional succinimidyl ester of cyanine 5.5 conjugated to dehydrogenase, a protein with a size similar to that of annexin V, was used to assess for capillary leakage. It was also more localized to the torsed testis relative to its contralateral sham control whether exposed or ex vivo (174% and 176%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge this study demonstrates for the first time the possibility of in vivo near infrared fluorescence imaging of apoptotic germ cells after testicular torsion in mice. It shows important confounding factors that must be considered as this new imaging technique is developed for detecting apoptotic cells in vivo in testes or in any other organ."

METHODS: The health status of 142 pediatric patients (85 boys) with previous hydrocephalus, born between 1995 and 1999, was assessed. Outcomes were determined using the HOQ, type of schooling, and motor functioning. Data were obtained from parental interviews and patient medical records. RESULTS. Twelve patients died (8.5%). Responses to the HOQ were obtained from 107 patients (65 boys). The mean age of the patients was 7 years and 9 months +/- 1.42 years (range 6-10 years). The Physical Health score of the HOQ correlated well with the motor functioning score (r = 0.652) as did the Cognitive Health score with the type of schooling (r = 0.672). Fifty-nine percent of the patients were able to attend a school for students with normal intelligence. Disabling motor functioning was found in only 30% of patients. Epilepsy was present in 14%. CONCLUSIONS: The results show a good correlation between the type of schooling and the Cognitive HOQ score and between the Physical HOQ score and the motor functioning score. The HOQ is a simple and very useful measurement for determining outcome in pediatric hydrocephalus."

To date, no gene mutation has been found, but five gene loci have been mapped in primary RLS to chromosomes 12q, 14q, 9p, 2q, and 20p (RLS1 through 5). PATIENTS/METHODS: We identified a four-generational German RLS family with 37 family members including 15 affected cases. We performed linkage analysis using microsatellite markers at the five known loci. Prompted by the identification of a potentially shared haplotype near the RLS3 locus, we expanded the investigated linkage region on chromosome 9p using additional DNA markers. RESULTS: Mode of inheritance in our RLS family was compatible with an autosomal dominant pattern, and disease onset was mainly in childhood or adolescence. We excluded linkage to the RLS1, RLS2, RLS4, and RLS5 loci. However, we identified a likely new RLS gene locus (RLS3*) on chromosome 9p with a maximum lod score of 3.60 generated by model-based multipoint linkage analysis. A haplotype flanked by D9S974 and D9S1118 in a 9.9-Mb region, centromeric to RLS3, was shared by all 12 investigated patients. In addition, 11 of them carried a common haplotype extending telomeric to D9S2189 that is located within RLS3. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate linkage to a locus on chromosome 9p that is probably distinct from RLS3. Our family with a rather homogeneous phenotype and very early disease onset represents a unique opportunity to further elucidate the genetic causes of the frequent restless leg syndrome."

With its low toxicity profile, curcumin (diferuloylmethane), a naturally occurring flavinoid derived from the rhizome of Curcuma longa, has great promise. In vitro and in vivo preclinical studies have shown its inhibitory anticancer, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiproliferative, and proapoptotic activities. The multiple mechanisms of the antitumor effect of curcumin putatively include down-regulating the expression of gene products such as nuclear factor-kappaB, growth suppression, inducing apoptosis, and modulating various signal transduction pathways and the expression of many oncogenes. The mechanisms underlying the antitumor activity of curcumin have not, however, been completely delineated. METHODS: An oligonucleotide microarray chip was developed and used to profile microRNA (miRNA) expressions in pancreatic cells treated with curcumin. Transcripts with regulated expression patterns on the arrays were validated by real-time PCRs. Additionally, potential mRNA targets were analyzed bioinformatically and confirmed with flow cytometry experiments. RESULTS: Curcumin alters miRNA expression in human pancreatic cells, up-regulating miRNA-22 and down-regulating miRNA-199a*, as confirmed by TaqMan real-time PCR. Upregulation of miRNA-22 expression by curcumin or by transfection with miRNA-22 mimetics in the PxBC-3 pancreatic cancer cell line suppressed expression of its target genes SP1 transcription factor (SP1) and estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1), while inhibiting miRNA-22 with antisense enhanced SP1 and ESR1 expression. CONCLUSIONS: These observations suggest that modulation of miRNA expression may be an important mechanism underlying the biological effects of curcumin."

In this study, we find that expression of Bik/Blk/Nbk is increased in human airway epithelial cells (AECs [HAECs]) in response to IFNgamma. Expression of Bik but not mutant BikL61G induces and loss of Bik suppresses IFNgamma-induced cell death in HAECs. IFNgamma treatment and Bik expression increase cathepsin B and D messenger RNA levels and reduce levels of phospho-extracellular regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) in the nuclei of bik(+/+) compared with bik(-/-) murine AECs. Bik but not BikL61G interacts with and suppresses nuclear translocation of phospho-ERK1/2, and suppression of ERK1/2 activation inhibits IFNgamma- and Bik-induced cell death. Furthermore, after prolonged exposure to allergen, hyperplastic epithelial cells persist longer, and nuclear phospho-ERK is more prevalent in airways of IFNgamma(-/-) or bik(-/-) compared with wild-type mice.

Batches of 10-15 islets were perifused and the hormones measured with RIA in 30-sec fractions. Increase of glucose from 3 to 20 mm resulted in a brief pulse of glucagon coinciding with suppression of basal insulin and somatostatin release. There was a subsequent drop of glucagon release concomitant with the appearance of a pronounced pulse of insulin and a slightly delayed pulse of somatostatin. Continued exposure to 20 mm glucose generated pulsatile release of the three hormones with 7- to 8-min periods accounting for 60-70% of the secreted amounts. Glucose caused pronounced stimulation of average insulin and somatostatin release. However, the nadirs between the glucagon pulses were lower than the secretion at 3 mm glucose, resulting in 18% suppression of average release. The repetitive glucagon pulses were antisynchronous to coincident pulses of insulin and somatostatin. The resulting greater than 20-fold variations of the insulin to glucagon ratio might be essential for minute-to-minute regulation of the hepatic glucose production."

Wound healing may be affected, leading to recurrences after hernia repair or primary incisional herniation. Women with genitourinary prolapse show signs of herniosis in the pelvis. Diverticulosis coli, commonly seen in the elderly, like hernia, was once attributed to stress and strain from constipation. It is now suspected that herniosis weakens the colonic ECM, allowing the mucosa to form diverticula by herniating alongside the vasa recta. Remarkably, clinical studies of Saint's triad extending over the past 60 years have repeatedly demonstrated a highly significant relationship between colonic diverticula and abdominal herniae. Krones et al. (Int J Colorectal Dis 21:18-24, 2006) reported that diverticula and cancer are rarely coincident in the colon, despite aging. Their data indicate that the two pathologies arise in different ECMs. Klinge et al. (Int J Colorectal Dis 22:515-520, 2007), quoting Paget (Lancet 1:571-573, 1889), \"Tumor cells can like seeds only grow if they fall on congenial soil,\" suggested that certain genes prevent stromal malignancy by influencing the microenvironment to stop epithelia from becoming cancerous. Thus, damage to the colonic ECM from hernial disease is conducive to diverticulosis, but hostile for cancer. Hernial disease being systemic, a similar ECM should be present throughout the body. Coincident diverticulosis and herniae support this hypothesis. Its validation requires further research involving the lifetime risk of cancer in patients with and without hernia. Since smoking causes both herniation and cancer, data from indulgers will have to be analyzed separately from abstainers."

Here, we report the first study of Cot/tpl2 involvement in acute peripheral inflammation in vivo. Six hours after an intraplantar injection of zymosan, Cot/tpl2(-/-) mice showed a 47% reduction in myeloperoxidase activity, concomitant with a 46% lower neutrophil recruitment and a 40% decreased luminol-mediated bioluminescence imaging in vivo.

Significantly impaired levels of G-CSF and GM-CSF and of other cytokines such as TNFalpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6, as well as some chemokines such as MCP-1, MIP-1beta, and keratinocyte-derived chemokine, were detected during the acute zymosan-induced intraplantar inflammatory response in Cot/tpl2(-/-) mice. Moreover, Cot/tpl2 deficiency dramatically decreased the production of the hypernociceptive ligand NGF at the inflammatory site during the course of inflammation. Most importantly, Cot/tpl2 deficiency significantly reduced zymosan-induced inflammatory hypernociception in mice, with a most pronounced effect of a 50% decrease compared with wild type (WT) at 24 h following intraplantar injection of zymosan. At this time, Cot/tpl2(-/-) mice showed significantly reduced NGF, TNFalpha, and prostaglandin E(2) levels compared with WT littermates. In conclusion, our study demonstrates an important role of Cot/tpl2 in the NGF, G-CSF, and GM-CSF production and myeloperoxidase activity in the acute inflammatory response process and its implication in inflammatory hypernociception."

In particular, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have provided supportive evidence that RA is a disease with a strong genetic background. Interestingly, a series of candidate genes have been identified outside of the classical major histocompatibility (MHC) locus, which had long been regarded as the major contributor to the pathogenesis of this disease. Among these genes, PTPN22 plays an outstanding role. CD40, STAT4, PRM1, and TNFAIP3 also seem to be of relevance. Interestingly, there is a significant overlap between RA susceptibility genes and those of other autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and type 1 diabetes, which suggests common pathogenic mechanisms. Genetic analyses may not only provide new insights into the pathogenesis of RA, but may also open new avenues for therapeutic approaches, because overactive immune-signaling pathways might specifically be addressed by biologic therapies. However, the predictive value of many of the recent findings of large-scale genetic analyses in identifying new genetic polymorphisms remains low.

The genes BANK1 and BLK were recently described as associated with SLE. BANK1 codes for a B-cell-specific cytoplasmic protein involved in B-cell receptor signalling and BLK codes for an Src tyrosine kinase with important roles in B-cell development. To characterise the role of BANK1 and BLK in SLE, a genetic interaction analysis was performed hypothesising that genetic interactions could reveal functional pathways relevant to disease pathogenesis. METHODS: The GPAT16 method was used to analyse the gene-gene interactions of BANK1 and BLK. Confocal microscopy was used to investigate co-localisation, and immunoprecipitation was used to verify the physical interaction of BANK1 and BLK. RESULTS: Epistatic interactions between BANK1 and BLK polymorphisms associated with SLE were observed in a discovery set of 279 patients and 515 controls from northern Europe. A meta-analysis with 4399 European individuals confirmed the genetic interactions between BANK1 and BLK. As BANK1 was identified as a binding partner of the Src tyrosine kinase LYN, the possibility that BANK1 and BLK could also show a protein-protein interaction was tested. The co-immunoprecipitation and co-localisation of BLK and BANK1 were demonstrated. In a Daudi cell line and primary naive B cells endogenous binding was enhanced upon B-cell receptor stimulation using anti-IgM antibodies. CONCLUSION: This study shows a genetic interaction between BANK1 and BLK, and demonstrates that these molecules interact physically. The results have important consequences for the understanding of SLE and other autoimmune diseases and identify a potential new signalling pathway."

A digitalis-induced increase in Ca(2+)(i) could also activate calcium-calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII), which has been shown to have proarrhythmic effects. Here, we investigate whether CaMKII underlies digitalis-induced arrhythmias and the subcellular mechanisms involved. METHODS AND RESULTS: In paced rat ventricular myocytes (0.5 Hz), 50 mumol/L ouabain increased contraction amplitude by 160 +- 5%. In the absence of electric stimulation, ouabain promoted spontaneous contractile activity and Ca(2+) waves. Ouabain activated CaMKII (p-CaMKII), which phosphorylated its downstream targets, phospholamban (PLN) (Thr17) and ryanodine receptor (RyR) (Ser2814). Ouabain-induced spontaneous activity was prevented by inhibiting CaMKII with 2.5 mumol/L KN93 but not by 2.5 mumol/L of the inactive analog, KN92. Similar results were obtained using the CaMKII inhibitor, autocamtide-2 related inhibitory peptide (AIP) (1 to 2.5 mumol/L), and in myocytes from transgenic mice expressing SR-targeted AIP. Consistently, CaMKII overexpression exacerbated ouabain-induced spontaneous contractile activity. Ouabain was associated with an increase in SR Ca(2+) content and Ca(2+) spark frequency, indicative of enhanced SR Ca(2+) leak. KN93 suppressed the ouabain-induced increase in Ca(2+) spark frequency without affecting SR Ca(2+) content. Similar results were obtained with digoxin. In vivo, ouabain-induced arrhythmias were prevented by KN93 and absent in SR-AIP mice. CONCLUSIONS: These results show for the first time that CaMKII mediates ouabain-induced arrhythmic/toxic effects. We suggest that CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation of the RyR, resulting in Ca(2+) leak from the SR, is the underlying mechanism involved."

This pooled analysis of four studies determined the level of association between uptake of the fibrillar amyloid beta positron emission tomography (PET) imaging agent [(18)F]flutemetamol (Pittsburgh Compound B analog with a 5.5 times longer half-life to enable it to be used in the clinical setting) and neuritic plaques and fibrillar amyloid beta measured by pathologic staining of cortical region biopsy samples. Fifty-two patients with suspected normal pressure hydrocephalus underwent prospective (n = 30) or retrospective (n = 22) [(18)F]flutemetamol PET imaging for detection of cerebral cortical fibrillar amyloid beta and cortical brain biopsy during intracranial pressure measurement or ventriculo-peritoneal shunting. [(18)F]Flutemetamol uptake was quantified using standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) with cerebellar cortex as the reference region. Tissue fibrillar amyloid beta was evaluated using immunohistochemical monoclonal antibody 4G8 and histochemical agents Thioflavin S and Bielschowsky silver stain, and an overall pathology result based on all available immunohistochemical and histochemical results. Biopsy site and contralateral [(18)F]flutemetamol SUVRs were significantly associated with neuritic plaque burden assessed with Bielschowsky silver stain (r                 (spearman's) = 0.61, p = 0.0001 for both), as was the composite SUVR with biopsy pathology (r                 (spearman's) = 0.74, p < 0.0001). SUVR and immunohistochemical results with 4G8 for detecting fibrillar amyloid beta were similar. Blinded image evaluation showed strong agreement between readers (kappa = 0.86). Overall sensitivity and specificity by majority read were 93 and 100 %. Noninvasive in vivo [(18)F]flutemetamol PET imaging demonstrates strong concordance with histopathology for brain fibrillar amyloid beta, supporting its promise as a tool to assist physicians with earlier detection of the disease process and making diagnostic decisions about concomitant AD and other diseases associated with brain amyloidosis."

Considering the spread distribution of CPVT mutations, we hypothesized that dysfunctional heterogeneity also was feasible. OBJECTIVE: To determine the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which a novel RyR2-V2475F mutation associated with CPVT in humans triggers Ca(2+)-dependent arrhythmias in whole hearts and intact mice. METHODS AND RESULTS: Recombinant channels harboring CPVT-linked RyR2 mutations were functionally characterized using tritiated ryanodine binding and single-channel recordings. Homologous recombination was used to generate a knock-in mouse bearing the RyR2-V2475F mutation. Ventricular myocytes from mice heterozygous for the mutation (RyR2-V2475F(+/-)) and their wild-type littermates were Ca(2+)-imaged by confocal microscopy under conditions that mimic stress. The propensity of wild-type and RyR2-V2475F(+/-) mice to have development of arrhythmias was tested at the whole heart level and in intact animals. Recombinant RyR2-V2475F channels displayed increased cytosolic Ca(2+) activation, abnormal protein kinase A phosphorylation, and increased activation by luminal Ca(2+). The RyR2-V2475F mutation appears embryonic-lethal in homozygous mice, but heterozygous mice have no alterations at baseline. Spontaneous Ca(2+) release events were more frequent and had shorter latency in isoproterenol-stimulated cardiomyocytes from RyR2-V2475F(+/-) hearts, but their threshold was unchanged with respect to wild-type. Adrenergically triggered tachyarrhythmias were more frequent in RyR2-V2475F(+/-) mice. CONCLUSIONS: The mutation RyR2-V2475F is phenotypically strong among other CPVT mutations and produces heterogeneous mechanisms of RyR2 dysfunction. In living mice, this mutation appears too severe to be harbored in all RyR2 channels but remains undetected under basal conditions if expressed at relatively low levels. beta-adrenergic stimulation breaks the delicate Ca(2+) equilibrium of RyR2-V2475F(+/-) hearts and triggers life-threatening arrhythmias."

Although genetic studies have had limited influence on clinical practice and drug discovery, they are currently generating testable hypotheses to explain disease pathogenesis. Firstly, we review here the major advances in identifying RA genetic susceptibility markers both within and outside of the MHC. Understanding how genetic variants translate into pathogenic mechanisms and ultimately into phenotypes remains a mystery for most of the polymorphisms that confer susceptibility to RA, but functional data are emerging. Interplay between environmental and genetic factors is poorly understood and in need of further investigation. Secondly, we review current knowledge of the role of epigenetics in RA susceptibility. Differences in the epigenome could represent one of the ways in which environmental exposures translate into phenotypic outcomes. The best understood epigenetic phenomena include post-translational histone modifications and DNA methylation events, both of which have critical roles in gene regulation. Epigenetic studies in RA represent a new area of research with the potential to answer unsolved questions."

In this study, we evaluated the effect of gefitinib, a potent ABCG2 inhibitor, on 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA)-PDT in brain tumor cell lines in vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four human glioma cell lines (U87MG, U118MG, A172, and T98G) and a malignant meningioma cell line (IOMM-Lee) were incubated with gefitinib (0.01-1.0muM) before incubation with 5-ALA (1mM). The effects gefitinib on intracellular protoporphyrin IX (PpIX), mRNA and protein expression of ABCG2, and PDT were evaluated, in vitro. RESULTS: At concentrations of 0.1muM or higher, gefitinib enhanced intracellular levels of PpIX in a dose-dependent manner in all those cell lines. Gefitinib decreased mRNA and plasma membrane protein expression of ABCG2, and efficiently enhanced the effect of 5-ALA-PDT in malignant brain tumor cells. CONCLUSION: Gefitinib can inhibit ABCG2-mediated PpIX efflux from malignant brain tumor cells to increase the intracellular PpIX and thereby enhance the PDT effect."

In the present study, we treated isolated mitochondria from MCF7 cells with recombinant protein Bax and tested the efficacy of the mPTP inhibitor cyclosporin A (CsA) and of the Bax channel blocker (Bcb) to inhibit cytochrome c release. We also, induced apoptosis in MCF7 cell cultures with TNF-alpha plus cycloheximide to determine the effect of such compounds in apoptosis induction via mPTP or Bax oligomerization. Cytochrome c release was totally prevented by CsA and partially by Bcb when apoptosis was induced with recombinant Bax in isolated mitochondria from MCF7 cells. CsA increased the number of living cells in cell culture, as compared with the effect of Bax channel blocker. These results indicate that mPTP activation is the predominant pathway for Bax-induced cytochrome c release from MCF7 mitochondria and for apoptosis induction in the whole cell. "

Here, we show that microRNA-mediated upregulation of Rictor, an mTORC2-specific component, contributes to tumor progression. Rictor is upregulated via the repression of the miR-424/503 cluster in human prostate and colon cancer cell lines that harbor c-Src upregulation and in Src-transformed cells. The tumorigenicity and invasive activity of these cells were suppressed by re-expression of miR-424/503. Rictor upregulation promotes formation of mTORC2 and induces activation of mTORC2, resulting in promotion of tumor growth and invasion. Furthermore, downregulation of miR-424/503 is associated with Rictor upregulation in colon cancer tissues. These findings suggest that the miR-424/503-Rictor pathway plays a crucial role in tumor progression. "

Experimental techniques suitable for characterizing PPIs (X-ray crystallography or nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, among others) are usually laborious, time-consuming and often difficult to apply to membrane proteins, and therefore require accurate prediction of the candidate interacting partners. High-throughput experimental methods (yeast two-hybrid and affinity purification) succumb to the same shortcomings, and can also lead to high rates of false positive and negative results. Therefore, reliable tools for predicting PPIs are needed. The use of the operon structure in the eukaryote Caenorhabditis elegans genome is a valuable, though underserved, tool for identifying physically or functionally interacting proteins. Based on the concept that genes organized in the same operon may encode physically or functionally related proteins, this algorithm is easy to be applied and, importantly, gives a limited number of candidate partners of a given protein, allowing for focused experimental verification. Moreover, this approach can be successfully used to predict PPIs in the human system, including those of membrane proteins."

METHODS: We analyzed the CCM1, CCM2, and CCM3 genes by MLPA and direct sequencing of exons and intronic boundaries in 94 familial forms and 41 sporadic cases of CCM patients of Spanish extraction. When available, RNA studies were performed seeking for alternative or cryptic splicing. RESULTS: A total of 26 pathogenic mutations, 22 of which predict truncated proteins, were identified in 29 familial forms and in three sporadic cases. The repertoire includes six novel non-sense and frameshift mutations in CCM1 and CCM3. We also found four missense mutations, one of them located at the third NPXY motif of CCM1 and another one that leads to cryptic splicing of CCM1 exon 6. We found four genomic deletions with the loss of the whole CCM2 gene in one patient and a partial loss of CCM1and CCM2 genes in three other patients. Four families had mutations in CCM3. The results include a high frequency of intronic variants, although most of them localize out of consensus splicing sequences. The main symptoms associated to clinical debut consisted of cerebral haemorrhage, migraines and epileptic seizures. The rare co-occurrence of CCM with Noonan and Chiari syndromes and delayed menarche is reported. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of CCM genes by sequencing and MLPA has detected mutations in almost 35% of a Spanish cohort (36% of familial cases and 10% of sporadic patients). The results include 13 new mutations of CCM genes and the main clinical symptoms that deserves consideration in molecular diagnosis and genetic counselling of cerebral cavernous malformations."

METHODS: The design was cross-sectional. Clinical activity was assessed by the Rachmilewitz Index (CAI). Three psychometric questionnaires were used: Zung Depression Rating Scale (ZDRS), Spielberg State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Colon biopsies were obtained from each affected anatomical site. Severity of inflammation was assessed by eosin/hematoxylin. Constitutive (HSP70c) and inducible (HSP70i) HSP70 expression were immunohistochemically studied. RESULTS: 29 UC patients were enrolled (69% men). Mean age was 46.5 years (SD: 19.5). Inflammation severity was moderate in 17 patients, severe in 6, and mild in 6. The mean number of years since diagnosis was 7.9 (SD: 6.5). The mean CAI was 6.4 (SD: 3.1). In active UC, there was downregulation of HSP70c in inflamed epithelium, without significant HSP70 induction. In 22/29 cases of active cryptitis, polymorphonuclear cells (PMN) clearly expressed HSP70i, with weak, focal positivity in the other 7 cases. Except for the hospital anxiety scale, scores in all psychometric tools were higher in patients with strong HSP70i immunoreactivity in the PMN. Logistic regression showed a strong positive relationship between HSP70i immunoreactivity in the PMN cells and scores in the trait anxiety, ZDRS, and hospital depression scales, (Odds ratios 1.3, 1.3, and 1.5; P = 0.018, 0.023, and 0.038; Wald test, 5.6, 5.2, and 4.3 respectively) and a weaker but significant positive correlation with the CAI (Odds ratio 1.654; P = 0.049; Wald test 3.858). CONCLUSION: HSP70 is induced in PMN cells of UC patients and its induction correlates with depression and anxiety levels."

The association between this index and response to intravenous thrombolysis for AIS has not been properly evaluated. OBJECTIVE: To assess the relationship between SPAN-100 index status and outcome following treatment with intravenous thrombolysis for AIS. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Using the Virtual International Stroke Trials Archive (VISTA) database, an international repository of clinical trials data, we assessed the SPAN-100 index among 7093 patients with AIS who participated in 4 clinical trials from 2000 to 2006. The SPAN-100 index is considered positive if the sum of the age and the NIH Stroke Scale (a 15-item neurological examination scale with scores ranging from 0 to 42, with higher scores indicating more severe strokes) score is greater than or equal to 100. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to determine the independent association between SPAN-100 index status and 90-day outcomes. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was a composite of severe disability or death measured 90 days after stroke, and the secondary outcomes were death alone and a composite of no disability/modest disability. RESULTS: Of 7093 patients, 743 (10.5%) were SPAN-100 positive, and 2731 (38.5%) received intravenous thrombolysis. Compared with SPAN-100-negative patients, SPAN-100-positive patients were more likely to experience a catastrophic outcome (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 9.03 [95% CI, 6.68-12.21]) or death alone (AOR, 5.03 [95% CI, 4.06-6.23]) and less likely to experience a favorable outcome (AOR, 0.08 [95% CI, 0.06-0.13]). However, there was an interaction between SPAN-100 index status and thrombolysis treatment (P < .001) revealing a reduction in the likelihood of severe disability/death with thrombolytic treatment for SPAN-100-positive (AOR, 0.46 [95% CI, 0.29-0.71]) but not SPAN-100-negative patients (AOR, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.85-1.07]). Similar interactions between SPAN-100 index status and thrombolysis treatment were observed for the 2 secondary outcomes. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Compared with the SPAN-100-negative patients with AIS, the SPAN-100-positive patients with AIS seem to have poorer 3-month outcomes but may derive greater benefit when treated with intravenous thrombolysis. The SPAN-100-positive patients are often excluded from AIS clinical trials but should probably not be denied thrombolysis treatment on the basis of such a profile alone."

Biofilms facilitate colonization and persistent infection in gallbladders of humans and mouse models of chronic carriage. Individual roles of matrix components have not been completely elucidated in vitro or in vivo To examine individual functions, strains of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, the murine model of S Typhi, in which various ECM genes were deleted or added, were created to examine biofilm formation, colonization, and persistence in the gallbladder. Studies show that curli contributes most significantly to biofilm formation. Expression of Vi antigen decreased biofilm formation in vitro and virulence and bacterial survival in vivo without altering the examined gallbladder pro- or anti-inflammatory cytokines. Oppositely, loss of all ECM components (DeltawcaM DeltacsgA DeltayihO DeltabcsE) increased virulence and bacterial survival in vivo and reduced gallbladder interleukin-10 (IL-10) levels. Colanic acid and curli mutants had the largest defects in biofilm-forming ability and contributed most significantly to the virulence increase of the DeltawcaM DeltacsgA DeltayihO DeltabcsE mutant strain. While the DeltawcaM DeltacsgA DeltayihO DeltabcsE mutant was not altered in resistance to complement or growth in macrophages, it attached and invaded macrophages better than the wild-type (WT) strain. These data suggest that ECM components have various levels of importance in biofilm formation and gallbladder colonization and that the ECM diminishes disseminated disease in our model, perhaps by reducing cell attachment/invasion and dampening inflammation by maintaining/inducing IL-10 production. Understanding how ECM components aid acute disease and persistence could lead to improvements in therapeutic treatment of typhoid fever patients."

Fixed-length approximate string matching is the problem of finding all factors of a text of length n that are at a distance at most k from any factor of length l of a pattern of length m. There exist bit-vector techniques to solve the fixed-length approximate string matching problem in time [Formula: see text] and space [Formula: see text] under the edit and Hamming distance models, where w is the size of the computer word; as such these techniques are independent of the distance threshold k or the alphabet size. Fixed-length approximate string matching is a generalisation of approximate string matching and, hence, has numerous direct applications in computational molecular biology and elsewhere. RESULTS: We present and make available libFLASM, a free open-source C++ software library for solving fixed-length approximate string matching under both the edit and the Hamming distance models. Moreover we describe how fixed-length approximate string matching is applied to solve real problems by incorporating libFLASM into established applications for multiple circular sequence alignment as well as single and structured motif extraction. Specifically, we describe how it can be used to improve the accuracy of multiple circular sequence alignment in terms of the inferred likelihood-based phylogenies; and we also describe how it is used to efficiently find motifs in molecular sequences representing regulatory or functional regions. The comparison of the performance of the library to other algorithms show how it is competitive, especially with increasing distance thresholds. CONCLUSIONS: Fixed-length approximate string matching is a generalisation of the classic approximate string matching problem. We present libFLASM, a free open-source C++ software library for solving fixed-length approximate string matching. The extensive experimental results presented here suggest that other applications could benefit from using libFLASM, and thus further maintenance and development of libFLASM is desirable."

When therapy with calcineurin inhibitors fails, adalimumab can be considered to avoid colectomy. The efficacy and safety of this sequential alternative salvage therapy remain unknown. Therefore, the present study was performed to investigate the short- and long-term efficacy and safety of adalimumab after failure of calcineurin inhibitors in corticosteroid-refractory UC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with a corticosteroid-refractory flare of UC who did not respond to calcineurin inhibitors and received continuing salvage therapy with adalimumab were included in this retrospective, observational, single-centre study. The cumulative rates of colectomy were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Clinical remission and response were evaluated based on the Rachmilewitz index. The cumulative rates of colectomy were calculated. Predictive factors for clinical remission and colectomy were identified. In the safety evaluation, any adverse event occurring after the administration of adalimumab was considered. RESULTS: Forty-one patients were enrolled; 78% had extensive colitis and 87% had moderate to severe colitis. Seventeen patients (41%) underwent colectomy during the follow-up period. At week 8, 26, and 52 after adalimumab injection, 27%, 39%, and 32% of patients achieved clinical remission, respectively. The adverse event rate was 17%, including one case of tuberculosis. CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of adalimumab for calcineurin inhibitor-refractory UC was examined for the first time. Treatment with adalimumab avoided the need for colectomy in two-thirds of patients with corticosteroid-refractory UC in whom calcineurin inhibitors had failed.

Reports on the incidence of thrombotic complications are however not available. METHODS: We evaluated the incidence of the composite outcome of symptomatic acute pulmonary embolism (PE), deep-vein thrombosis, ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction or systemic arterial embolism in all COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU of 2 Dutch university hospitals and 1 Dutch teaching hospital. RESULTS: We studied 184 ICU patients with proven COVID-19 pneumonia of whom 23 died (13%), 22 were discharged alive (12%) and 139 (76%) were still on the ICU on April 5th 2020. All patients received at least standard doses thromboprophylaxis. The cumulative incidence of the composite outcome was 31% (95%CI 20-41), of which CTPA and/or ultrasonography confirmed VTE in 27% (95%CI 17-37%) and arterial thrombotic events in 3.7% (95%CI 0-8.2%). PE was the most frequent thrombotic complication (n = 25, 81%). Age (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 1.05/per year, 95%CI 1.004-1.01) and coagulopathy, defined as spontaneous prolongation of the prothrombin time > 3 s or activated partial thromboplastin time > 5 s (aHR 4.1, 95%CI 1.9-9.1), were independent predictors of thrombotic complications. CONCLUSION: The 31% incidence of thrombotic complications in ICU patients with COVID-19 infections is remarkably high. Our findings reinforce the recommendation to strictly apply pharmacological thrombosis prophylaxis in all COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU, and are strongly suggestive of increasing the prophylaxis towards high-prophylactic doses, even in the absence of randomized evidence."

Curcumin is a natural phenolic compound which shows potent anticancer activities in different tumors, alone or as an adjuvant with other antitumor drugs to prevent or inhibit the survival and cancer progression by various mechanisms. The role of curcumin in overcoming drug resistance was followed by reviewing different applications of curcumin in cancer therapy. Afterward, the clinical impacts of curcumin, role of curcumin in decreasing drug resistance in different cancer cells and its mechanisms were discussed. It has been demonstrated that curcumin regulates signaling pathways in cancer cells, reduces the expression of proteins related to drug resistance, and increases the performance of antitumor drugs at various levels. Curcumin reverses multidrug resistance mechanisms and increases sensitivity of resistance cells to chemotherapy. This review mainly focuses on different mechanisms of drug resistance and curcumin as a nontoxic natural substance to eliminate the effects of drug resistance through modulation and controlling cell resistance pathways and eventually suggests curcumin as a potent chemosensitizer in cancers."

The drug may have efficacy in patients with HER2-positive advanced gastric cancer. METHODS: In an open-label, randomized, phase 2 trial, we evaluated trastuzumab deruxtecan as compared with chemotherapy in patients with HER2-positive advanced gastric cancer. Patients with centrally confirmed HER2-positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma that had progressed while they were receiving at least two previous therapies, including trastuzumab, were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive trastuzumab deruxtecan (6.4 mg per kilogram of body weight every 3 weeks) or physician's choice of chemotherapy. The primary end point was the objective response, according to independent central review. Secondary end points included overall survival, response duration, progression-free survival, confirmed response (response persisting >=4 weeks), and safety. RESULTS: Of 187 treated patients, 125 received trastuzumab deruxtecan and 62 chemotherapy (55 received irinotecan and 7 paclitaxel). An objective response was reported in 51% of the patients in the trastuzumab deruxtecan group, as compared with 14% of those in the physician's choice group (P<0.001). Overall survival was longer with trastuzumab deruxtecan than with chemotherapy (median, 12.5 vs. 8.4 months; hazard ratio for death, 0.59; 95% confidence interval, 0.39 to 0.88; P = 0.01, which crossed the prespecified O'Brien-Fleming boundary [0.0202 on the basis of number of deaths]). The most common adverse events of grade 3 or higher were a decreased neutrophil count (in 51% of the trastuzumab deruxtecan group and 24% of the physician's choice group), anemia (38% and 23%, respectively), and decreased white-cell count (21% and 11%). A total of 12 patients had trastuzumab deruxtecan-related interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis (grade 1 or 2 in 9 patients and grade 3 or 4 in 3), as adjudicated by an independent committee. One drug-related death (due to pneumonia) was noted in the trastuzumab deruxtecan group; no drug-related deaths occurred in the physician's choice group. CONCLUSIONS: Therapy with trastuzumab deruxtecan led to significant improvements in response and overall survival, as compared with standard therapies, among patients with HER2-positive gastric cancer. Myelosuppression and interstitial lung disease were the notable toxic effects. (Funded by Daiichi Sankyo; DESTINY-Gastric01 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03329690.)."

Due to the highly diverse biological functions of the progranulin (PGRN) protein, encoded by GRN, multiple possible disease mechanisms have been proposed.

KRAS mutant tumors constitute a heterogeneous group of diseases, different from other oncogene-derived tumors in terms of biology and response to treatment, which hinders the development of effective drugs against KRAS. Therefore, for decades, despite enormous efforts invested in the development of drugs aimed at inhibiting KRAS or its signaling pathways, KRAS was considered to be undruggable. Recently, the discovery of a new pocket under the effector binding switch II region of KRAS G12C has allowed the development of direct KRAS inhibitors such as sotorasib, the first FDA-approved drug targeting KRAS G12C, or adagrasib, initiating a new exciting era. However, treatment with targeted KRAS G12C inhibitors also leads to resistance, and understanding the possible mechanisms of resistance and which drugs could be useful to overcome it is key. Among others, KRAS G12C (ON) tricomplex inhibitors and different combination therapy strategies are being analyzed in clinical trials. Another area of interest is the potential role of co-mutations in treatment selection, particularly immunotherapy. The best first-line strategy remains to be determined and, due to the heterogeneity of KRAS, is likely to be based on combination therapies."

Accumulation of the unique RNA product is highly sensitive to alpha-amanitin in HeLa NE and only partially sensitive to this drug in NE from PMG cells that contain an allele of the alpha-amanitin-resistant subunit of pol II, strongly suggesting pol II involvement in this reaction. Detailed analysis of the RNA product revealed that it represents a chimeric molecule composed of a newly synthesized transcript covalently attached to the 5' half of the RNA template. Selection of the start site for transcription is remarkably specific and depends on the secondary structure of the RNA template, rather than on its primary sequence. Some features of this reaction resemble the RNA cleavage-extension process observed for pol II-arrested complexes in vitro.

Hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis and renal salt wasting are the common characteristics of all three subtypes. Hypocalciuria and hypomagnesemia are specific clinical features of Gitelman syndrome, while HPS/aBS is a life-threatening disorder of the newborn with polyhydramnios, premature delivery, hyposthenuria, and nephrocalcinosis. The Gitelman variant is uniformly caused by mutations in the gene for the thiazide-sensitive NaCl-cotransporter NCCT (SLC12A3) of the distal tubule, while HPS/aBS is caused by mutations in the gene for either the furosemide-sensitive NaK-2Cl-cotransporter NKCC2 (SLC12A1) or the inwardly rectifying potassium channel ROMK (KCNJ1). Recently, mutations in a basolateral chloride channel CLC-Kb (CLCNKB) have been described in a subset of patients with a Bartter-like phenotype typically lacking nephrocalcinosis. In this study, the screening for CLCNKB mutations showed 20 different mutations in the affected children from 30 families. The clinical characterization revealed a highly variable phenotype ranging from episodes of severe volume depletion and hypokalemia during the neonatal period to almost asymptomatic patients diagnosed during adolescence. This study adds 16 novel mutations to the nine already described, providing further evidence that mutations in the gene for the basolateral chloride channel CLC-Kb are the molecular basis of classic Bartter syndrome. Interestingly, the phenotype elicited by CLCNKB mutations occasionally includes HPS/aBS, as well as a Gitelman-like phenotype."

In view of a possible role of marginal zone (MZ) B cells in murine SLE, we have explored whether the expression of the Yaa mutation affects the differentiation of MZ and follicular B cells, thereby implicating the acceleration of the disease. In this study, we show that both BXSB and C57BL/6 Yaa mice, including two different substrains of BXSB Yaa males that are protected from SLE, displayed an impaired development of MZ B cells early in life. Studies in bone marrow chimeras revealed that the loss of MZ B cells resulted from a defect intrinsic to B cells expressing the Yaa mutation. The lack of selective expansion of MZ B cells in diseased BXSB Yaa males strongly argues against a major role of MZ B cells in the generation of pathogenic autoantibodies in the BXSB model of SLE. Furthermore, a comparative analysis with mice deficient in CD22 or expressing an IgM anti-trinitrophenyl/DNA transgene suggests that the hyperreactive phenotype of Yaa B cells, as judged by a markedly increased spontaneous IgM secretion, is likely to contribute to the enhanced maturation toward follicular B cells and the block in the MZ B cell generation."

Effective treatment relies on accurate diagnosis and is gestational age dependent. The diagnosis of PPROM is made by a combination of clinical suspicion, patient history and some simple tests. PPROM is associated with significant maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality from infection, umbilical cord compression, placental abruption and preterm birth. Subclinical intrauterine infection has been implicated as a major aetiological factor in the pathogenesis and subsequent maternal and neonatal morbidity associated with PPROM. The frequency of positive cultures obtained by transabdominal amniocentesis at the time of presentation with PPROM in the absence of labour is 25-40%. The majority of amniotic fluid infection in the setting of PPROM does not produce the signs and symptoms traditionally used as diagnostic criteria for clinical chorioamnionitis. Any evidence of infection by amniocentesis should be considered carefully as an indication for delivery. Documentation of amniotic fluid infection in women who present with PPROM enables us to triage our therapeutic decision making rationally. In PPROM, the optimal interval for delivery occurs when the risks of immaturity are outweighed by the risks of pregnancy prolongation (infection, abruption and cord accident). Lung maturity assessment may be a useful guide when planning delivery in the 32- to 34-week interval. A gestational age approach to therapy is important and should be adjusted for each hospital's neonatal intensive care unit. Antenatal antibiotics and corticosteroid therapies have clear benefits and should be offered to all women without contraindications. During conservative management, women should be monitored closely for placental abruption, infection, labour and a non-reassuring fetal status. Women with PPROM after 32 weeks of gestation should be considered for delivery, and after 34 weeks the benefits of delivery clearly outweigh the risks."

Here we provide evidence that mice differ from zebrafish in the way they use homologous key components to regulate pigment cell differentiation. In both zebrafish and mice, one transcription factor, SOX10, controls the expression of another, MITF (microphthalmia-associated transcription factor), which in turn regulates a set of genes critical for pigment cell development and pigmentation. Mutations in either Sox10 or Mitf impair pigment cell development. In Sox10-mutant zebrafish, experimentally induced expression of Mitf fully rescues pigmentation. Using lineage-directed gene transfer, we show that, in the mouse, Mitf can rescue Sox10-mutant precursor cells only partially. In fact, retrovirally mediated, Sox10-independent Mitf expression in mouse melanoblasts leads to cell survival and expression of a number of pigment biosynthetic genes but does not lead to expression of tyrosinase, the rate-limiting pigment gene which critically depends on both Sox10 and Mitf. Hence, compared with fish, mice have evolved a regulation of tyrosinase expression that includes feed-forward loops between Sox10 and tyrosinase regulatory regions. The results may help to explain how some embryos, such as zebrafish, can achieve rapid pigmentation after fertilization, whereas others, such as mice, become pigmented only several days after birth."

This transcription factor plays a fundamental role in melanocyte development and maintenance and seems to be crucial for the survival of malignant melanocytes. Furthermore, Mitf has been shown to be involved in cell cycle regulation and to play important functions in self-renewal and maintenance of melanocyte stem cells. Although little is known about how Mitf regulates these various processes, one possibility is that Mitf interacts with other regulators. Here we show that Mitf can interact directly with beta-catenin, the key mediator of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. The Wnt signaling pathway plays a critical role in melanocyte development and is intimately involved in triggering melanocyte stem cell proliferation. Significantly, constitutive activation of this pathway is a feature of a number of cancers including malignant melanoma. Here we show that Mitf can redirect beta-catenin transcriptional activity away from canonical Wnt signaling-regulated genes toward Mitf-specific target promoters to activate transcription. Thus, by a feedback mechanism, Mitf can diversify the output of canonical Wnt signaling to enhance the repertoire of genes regulated by beta-catenin. Our results reveal a novel mechanism by which Wnt signaling and beta-catenin activate gene expression, with significant implications for our understanding of both melanocyte development and melanoma."

One potential mechanism by which these microorganisms may cause PPROM is by increasing the concentration of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in the membranes and amniotic fluid. We tested this hypothesis in a well-defined model system of genital infection with M. pulmonis, a natural reproductive pathogen of rats. METHOD OF STUDY: Timed-pregnant, specific pathogen-free, Sprague-Dawley rats were infected with 10(7) CFU M. pulmonis at gestation day (gd) 14. Controls received an equivalent volume (100 microL) of sterile medium. At gd 18, rats were euthanized, and membranes and amniotic fluids were harvested and stored at -70 degrees C until analysis. Proteinase activity of amniotic fluid and membranes was resolved on discontinuous 7.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gelatin zymography gels. Band intensity was determined using a digital gel documentation system and the manufacturer's software (Kodak). RESULTS: Gelatinolytic activity associated with a band similar in molecular weight to ProMMP-9 (92 kDa, the inactive precursor of MMP-9) was significantly increased in amniotic fluids and membranes harvested from M. pulmonis-treated pups at gd 18 when compared with tissues harvested from control pups. Both ProMMP-9 and ProMMP-2 (72 kDa, the inactive precursor of MMP-2) were increased in infected animals at gd 21.

Thus, DNA methylation could be a major mechanism by which to produce semi-stable changes in gene expression in somatic tissues. Although it remains controversial whether germ-line DNA methylation in mammalian genomes is stably heritable, frequent tissue-specific and disease-specific de novo methylation events are observed during somatic cell development/differentiation. In this minireview, we discuss the use of restriction landmark genomic scanning, together with in silico analysis, to identify differentially methylated regions in the mammalian genome. We then present a rough overview of quantitative DNA methylation patterns at 4600 NotI sites and more than 150 differentially methylated regions in several C57BL/6J mouse tissues. Comparative analysis between mice and humans suggests that some, but not all, tissue-specific differentially methylated regions are conserved.

METHODS: Thirty-seven acute stroke patients (ischemic, n = 19; hemorrhagic, n = 18) were enrolled. All of them were admitted to our hospital within 8 h after stroke onset. Neurological status was evaluated by a modified National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (mNIHSS) on admission and by a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 1 month. An mRS score of 3 or more at 1 month was considered to indicate poor outcome. Serum samples for the cytokine and catecholamine measurements were collected on admission. Plasma levels of IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-alpha were determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method and epinephrine and norepinephrine concentrations were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection (HPLC-EC). RESULTS: In the ischemic stroke patients, poor outcome was noted in 9 (47%). There were no significant differences in cytokine or catecholamine concentrations between patients with poor and good outcomes, and there was no association between clinical outcome and cytokine and catecholamine concentrations. In the hemorrhagic stroke patients, poor outcome was noted in 10 (56%). IL-6 and IL-10 levels were higher in patients with poor outcome. On logistic regression analysis, higher values of IL-6 were significantly associated with clinical outcome at 1 month (odds ratio [OR], 1.25; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.54). CONCLUSION: In ischemic stroke, plasma cytokines and catecholamines were not predictors of neurological outcome at 1 month. In hemorrhagic stroke, high levels of IL-6 in the early phase indicated a poor neurological outcome."

        "text": "Psammoma body: a product of dystrophic calcification or of a biologically active process that aims at limiting the growth and spread of tumor?\nPsammoma bodies (PBs) are concentric lamellated calcified structures, observed most commonly in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), meningioma, and papillary serous cystadenocarcinoma of ovary but have rarely been reported in other neoplasms and nonneoplastic lesions. PBs are said to represent a process of dystrophic calcification. Despite numerous ancillary studies over a span of three and half decades, formation of PBs remains a poorly understood mechanism. Ultrastructural study of PTC has shown that thickening of the base lamina in vascular stalk of neoplastic papillae followed by thrombosis, calcification, and tumor cell necrosis leads to formation of PBs. Studies on serous cystadenocarcinoma of ovary and meningioma, however, revealed that collagen production by neoplastic cells and subsequent calcification was responsible for the formation of PBs. The existence of some precursor forms of PBs was reported in meningiomas and more recently in PTC, which were mostly in the form of extracellular hyaline globules surrounded by well-preserved neoplastic cells or in a smaller number of cases intracytoplasmic bodies liberated from intact tumor cells. Cellular degeneration and necrosis, leading to the disappearance of neoplastic cells, were noticed by us only around PBs but not around the precursor forms. Based on the above findings, it is suggested that rather than being the outcome of dystrophic calcification of dead or dying tissue, PBs may indeed represent an active biologic process ultimately leading to degeneration/death of tumor cells and retardation of growth of the neoplasm. It may also serve as a barrier against the spread of neoplasm."

METHODS AND RESULTS: This was a phase II multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of New York Heart Association class II to IV congestive heart failure patients randomized (2:1) to DITPA or placebo and treated for 6 months. The study enrolled 86 patients (n=57 to DITPA, n=29 to placebo). The primary objective was to assess the effect of DITPA on a composite congestive heart failure end point that classifies patients as improved, worsened, or unchanged based on symptom changes and morbidity/mortality. DITPA was poorly tolerated, which obscured the interpretation of congestive heart failure-specific effects. Fatigue and gastrointestinal complaints, in particular, were more frequent in the DITPA group. DITPA increased cardiac index (by 18%) and decreased systemic vascular resistance (by 11%), serum cholesterol (-20%), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-30%), and body weight (-11 lb). Thyroid-stimulating hormone was suppressed in patients given DITPA, which reflects its thyromimetic effect; however, no symptoms or signs of potential hypothyroidism or thyrotoxicosis were seen. CONCLUSIONS: DITPA improved some hemodynamic and metabolic parameters, but there was no evidence for symptomatic benefit in congestive heart failure."

However, how they function as tumor suppressors remains elusive. Here, I propose a number of tumor suppressor pathways that illustrate how the TA-p73 and p63 could function as negative regulators of invasion, metastasis, and cancer stem cells (CSCs) proliferation. Furthermore, I provide molecular insights into how TA-p73 and p63 could function as tumor suppressors. Remarkably, the guardians--p53, p73, and p63--of the genome are in control of most of the known tumor suppressor miRNAs, tumor suppressor genes, and metastasis suppressors by suppressing c-myc through miR-145/let-7/miR-34/TRIM32/PTEN/FBXW7. In particular, p53 and TA-p73/p63 appear to upregulate the expression of (1) tumor suppressor miRNAs, such as let-7, miR-34, miR-15/16a, miR-145, miR-29, miR-26, miR-30, and miR-146a; (2) tumor suppressor genes, such as PTEN, RBs, CDKN1a/b/c, and CDKN2a/b/c/d; (3) metastasis suppressors, such as Raf kinase inhibitory protein, CycG2, and DEC2, and thereby they enlarge their tumor suppressor network to inhibit tumorigenesis, invasion, angiogenesis, migration, metastasis, and CSCs proliferation."

Therefore, the identification and characterisation of highly expressed genes in the testis that are involved in apoptosis is of great value to delineate the mechanism of spermatogenesis. Here, we reported that Fank1, a novel gene highly expressed in testis, functioned as an anti-apoptotic protein that activated the activator protein 1 (AP-1) pathway. We found that Jab1 (Jun activation domain-binding protein 1), a co-activator of AP-1, specifically interacted with Fank1. Reporter analyses showed that Fank1 activated AP-1 pathway in a Jab1-dependent manner. Fank1 overexpression also increased the expression and activation of endogenous c-Jun. Further study showed that Fank1 inhibited cell apoptosis by upregulating and activating endogenous c-Jun and its downstream target, Bcl-3. This process was shown to be Jab1 dependent. Taken together, our results indicated that by interacting with Jab1, Fank1 could suppress cell apoptosis by activating the AP-1-induced anti-apoptotic pathway."

Among the few studies which investigate the correlation between DNA methylation and expression of genes with non-CpG island promoters, the majority do not support the view that DNA methylation directly leads to transcription silencing of these genes. Our reporter assays and gene reactivation by 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, a DNA demethylating agent, show that DNA methylation occurring at CpG poor LAMB3 promoter and RUNX3 promoter 1(RUNX3 P1) can directly lead to transcriptional silencing in cells competent to express these genes in vitro. Using Nucleosome Occupancy Methylome- Sequencing, NOMe-Seq, a single-molecule, high-resolution nucleosome positioning assay, we demonstrate that active, but not inactive, non-CpG island promoters display a nucleosome-depleted region (NDR) immediately upstream of the transcription start site (TSS). Furthermore, using NOMe-Seq and clonal analysis, we show that in RUNX3 expressing 623 melanoma cells, RUNX3 P1 has two distinct chromatin configurations: one is unmethylated with an NDR upstream of the TSS; another is methylated and nucleosome occupied, indicating that RUNX3 P1 is monoallelically methylated. Together, these results demonstrate that the epigenetic signatures comprising DNA methylation, histone marks and nucleosome occupancy of non-CpG island promoters are almost identical to CpG island promoters, suggesting that aberrant methylation patterns of non-CpG island promoters may also contribute to tumorigenesis and should therefore be included in analyses of cancer epigenetics."

We now show that this dystrophin expression was accompanied by an elevated expression of alpha-sarcoglycan, beta-dystroglycan (BDG) and--in relevant cases--neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) at the sarcolemma, each of which is a component of a different subcomplex of the dystrophin-associated glycoprotein complex (DAPC). As expected, nNOS expression was relocalized to the sarcolemma in Duchenne patients in whom the dystrophin deletion left the nNOS-binding domain (exons 42-45) intact, whereas this did not occur in patients with deletions that involved this domain. Our results indicate that the novel internally deleted and shorter dystrophin induced by skipping exon 51 in patients with amenable deletions, can also restore the dystrophin-associated complex, further suggesting preserved functionality of the newly translated dystrophin."

A 64-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease, pacemaker placement, and atrial fibrillation developed acute right arm/face weakness and dysarthria. He was unable to list his home medications. His platelet count was 167 x 10(9)/L (normal 150-399 x 10(9)/L), and his activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) was 37.6 seconds (normal 24.0-33.0 seconds). His international normalized ratio (INR) was 1.1. He received IV-rtPA at 3 hours and 25 minutes after the onset of symptoms. After IV-rtPA was administered, it was discovered that the patient had been taking dabigatran for 2 months. After IV-rtPA, the patient developed severe superficial left arm ecchymoses but remained without cerebral complications. On poststroke day 1, his fibrinogen level was low at 63 mg % (normal 190-395 mg %), his aPTT was normal at 33, and his INR was elevated at 1.72 but decreased to 1.18 on the following day. Repeat computed tomographic imaging of his brain confirmed a left middle cerebral artery ischemic cortical infarct. We report a case of an acute stroke patient taking dabigatran who received IV-rtPA. In the acute stroke setting, clinicians should be aware of the increasing use of dabigatran in patients with atrial fibrillation when considering IV-rtPA. Although aPTT does not provide a linear response to dabigatran therapy, the presence of a completely normal PTT may exclude therapeutic dabigatran anticoagulation."

        "text": "Targeting the microenvironment in chronic lymphocytic leukemia is changing the therapeutic landscape.\nPURPOSE OF REVIEW: Despite ongoing efforts to decipher the cancer genome, discoveries of new targetable genetic lesions within cancer cells are rare. Therefore, alternative approaches are needed. Signals from the microenvironment are increasingly recognized as drivers of disease progression in hematologic and solid cancers. Consequently, there is growing interest in targeting the tumor-microenvironment cross-talk. This review highlights recent therapeutic advances in targeting the microenvironment in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). RECENT FINDINGS: CLL is the poster child for microenvironment-dependent malignancies, because the clonal CLL B cells are highly dependent on external signals for maintenance and expansion. These pathways recapitulate those responsible for normal B-cell expansion in germinal centers. The most prominent, conserved mechanism is B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling, which promotes CLL cell survival and expansion in lymphatic tissue areas designated proliferation centers. BCR signaling now can be targeted by new targeted kinase inhibitors. SUMMARY: Small molecule inhibitors of BCR signaling kinases, Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) inhibitor ibrutinib and the phosphoinositide 3'-kinase delta (PI3Kdelta) inhibitor GS-1101, are currently transforming the landscape of CLL therapy. This development exemplifies that the microenvironment has become a lively successful area of translational research."

We tested whether treatment with teplizumab (a Fc receptor non-binding anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody), after the new-onset period, affects the decline in C-peptide production in individuals with type 1 diabetes. METHODS: In a randomised placebo-controlled trial we treated 58 participants with type 1 diabetes for 4-12 months with teplizumab or placebo at four academic centres in the USA. A central randomisation centre used computer generated tables to allocate treatments. Investigators, patients, and caregivers were blinded to group assignment. The primary outcome was a comparison of C-peptide responses to a mixed meal after 1 year. We explored modification of treatment effects in subgroups of patients. RESULTS: Thirty-four and 29 subjects were randomized to the drug and placebo treated groups, respectively. Thirty-one and 27, respectively, were analysed. Although the primary outcome analysis showed a 21.7% higher C-peptide response in the teplizumab-treated group (0.45 vs 0.371; difference, 0.059 [95% CI 0.006, 0.115] nmol/l) (p = 0.03), when corrected for baseline imbalances in HbA(1c) levels, the C-peptide levels in the teplizumab-treated group were 17.7% higher (0.44 vs 0.378; difference, 0.049 [95% CI 0, 0.108] nmol/l, p = 0.09). A greater proportion of placebo-treated participants lost detectable C-peptide responses at 12 months (p = 0.03). The teplizumab group required less exogenous insulin (p < 0.001) but treatment differences in HbA(1c) levels were not observed. Teplizumab was well tolerated. A subgroup analysis showed that treatment benefits were larger in younger individuals and those with HbA(1c) <6.5% at entry. Clinical responders to teplizumab had an increase in circulating CD8 central memory cells 2 months after enrolment compared with non-responders. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATIONS: This study suggests that deterioration in insulin secretion may be affected by immune therapy with teplizumab after the new-onset period but the magnitude of the effect is less than during the new-onset period. Our studies identify characteristics of patients most likely to respond to this immune therapy.

To investigate the extent of interactions of this new anticoagulant with frequently used coagulation assays, we completed a multicenter in vitro trial with Conformite Europeenne(CE)-labeled dabigatran-spiked plasma samples. METHODS: Lyophilized plasma samples with dabigatran concentrations ranging from 0.00 to 0.48 mug/mL were sent to the coagulation laboratories of six major Austrian hospitals for evaluation. Coagulation assays were performed under routine conditions using standard reagents and analyzer. RESULTS: Dabigatran led to a dose-dependent prolongation of the clotting times in coagulometric tests and influenced the majority of the parameters measured. Statistically significant interference could be observed with the prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and PT/aPTT-based assays (extrinsic/intrinsic factors, APC-resistance test) as well as lupus anticoagulant testing. Even non-clotting tests, such as the colorimetric factor XIII activity assay and to a minor extent the amidolytic antithrombin activity assay (via factor IIa) were affected. CONCLUSIONS: This multicenter trial confirms and also adds to existing data, demonstrating that laboratories should expect to observe strong interferences of coagulation tests with increasing concentrations of dabigatran. This finding might become particularly important in the elderly and in patients with renal impairment as well as patients whose blood is drawn at peak levels of dabigatran."

Here we report a previously unknown signaling pathway that is necessary for the conversion from short- to long-term memory. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 2 (mTORC2), which contains the regulatory protein Rictor (rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR), was discovered only recently and little is known about its function. We found that conditional deletion of Rictor in the postnatal murine forebrain greatly reduced mTORC2 activity and selectively impaired both long-term memory (LTM) and the late phase of hippocampal long-term potentiation (L-LTP). We also found a comparable impairment of LTM in dTORC2-deficient flies, highlighting the evolutionary conservation of this pathway. Actin polymerization was reduced in the hippocampus of mTORC2-deficient mice and its restoration rescued both L-LTP and LTM. Moreover, a compound that promoted mTORC2 activity converted early LTP into late LTP and enhanced LTM. Thus, mTORC2 could be a therapeutic target for the treatment of cognitive dysfunction."

METHODS: Cystatin C and creatinine were measured from specimens taken and stored during the 1999-2000 examination among 908 HIV-infected participants in the Women's Interagency HIV study (WIHS). Mean follow-up was 10.2 years. Predictors of differential glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimates were evaluated with multivariable linear regression. The associations of baseline categories (<60, 60-90, and >90 ml/min per 1.73 m) of creatinine estimated GFR (eGFRcr), cystatin C eGFR (eGFRcys), and combined creatinine-cystatin C eGFR (eGFRcr-cys) with all-cause mortality were evaluated using multivariable Cox regression. The net reclassification index (NRI) was calculated to evaluate the effect of cystatin C on reclassification of CKD staging. RESULTS: CKD risk factors were associated with lower eGFRcys and eGFRcr-cys values compared with eGFRcr. Relative to eGFR more than 90, the eGFR less than 60 category by eGFRcys (Adjusted hazard ratio: 2.56; 95% confidence interval: 1.63-4.02), eGFRcr-cys (3.11; 1.94-5.00), and eGFRcr (2.34; 1.44-3.79) was associated with increased mortality risk. However, the eGFR 60-90 category was associated with increased mortality risk for eGFRcys (1.80; 1.28-2.53) and eGFRcr-cys (1.91; 1.38-2.66) but not eGFRcr (1.20; 0.85-1.67). The overall NRI for mortality was 26% when reclassifying from eGFRcr to eGFRcys (P < 0.001) and was 20% when reclassifying from eGFRcr to eGFRcr-cys (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The addition of cystatin C may improve mortality risk prediction by stages of kidney function relative to creatinine. CKD risk factors are associated with an overestimate of GFR by serum creatinine relative to cystatin C."

Interestingly, recent studies reveal a substantial diversity among CGIs: long and short CGIs, for example, exhibit contrasting patterns of gene expression complexity and nucleosome occupancy. Evolutionary origins of CGIs are also highly heterogeneous. In order to systematically evaluate potential diversities among CGIs and ultimately to illuminate the link between diversity of CGIs and their epigenetic variation, we analyzed the nucleotide-resolution DNA methylation maps (methylomes) of multiple cellular origins. We discover novel 'clusters' of CGIs according to their patterns of DNA methylation; the stably hypomethylated CGI cluster (cluster I), sperm-hypomethylated CGI cluster (cluster II), and variably methylated CGI cluster (cluster III). These epigenomic CGI clusters are strikingly distinct at multiple biological features including genomic, evolutionary, and functional characteristics. At the genomic level, the stably hypomethylated CGI cluster tends to be longer and harbors many more CpG dinucleotides than those in other clusters. They are also frequently associated with promoters, while CGI clusters II and III mostly reside in intragenic or intergenic regions and exhibit highly tissue-specific DNA methylation. Functional ontology terms and transcriptional profiles co-vary with CGI clusters, indicating that the regulatory functions of CGIs are tightly linked to their heterogeneity. Finally, CGIs associated with distinctive biological processes, such as diseases, aging, and imprinting, occur disproportionately across CGI clusters. These new findings provide an effective means to combine existing knowledge on CGIs into a genomic context while bringing new insights that elucidate the significance of DNA methylation across different biological conditions and demography.

Bedaquiline works by inhibiting bacterial adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase and represents the first novel class of antituberculosis agents in more than 40 years. Bedaquiline is indicated for the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) in combination with at least three other antitubercular drugs when no other effective regimen is available. The recommended bedaquiline dosage is 400 mg orally once/day for 2 weeks followed by 200 mg orally 3 times/week for 22 weeks. Bedaquiline should be administered with food, which increases the bioavailability 2-fold. Bedaquiline is metabolized by cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 3A4 and is impacted by both inducers and inhibitors of this isoenzyme. Concentration-dependent bactericidal activity was observed in laboratory and murine studies. Accelerated approval was granted in the United States and European Union based on the results of two phase IIb clinical studies that used sputum culture clearance as a surrogate end point for clinical efficacy. These studies showed greater sputum culture clearance up to week 24 for the bedaquiline group compared with placebo. Common adverse events in clinical trials included nausea, arthralgia, and headache. Serious adverse events included elevated serum transaminase levels and rate-corrected QT-interval prolongation. Unexplained higher mortality was seen in patients receiving bedaquiline versus those receiving placebo. Bedaquiline is a novel agent with a unique mechanism of action and has the potential to meet a great need in patients with MDR TB who have no other treatment options. Due to safety concerns and limited clinical information, phase III trials are needed to fully determine its place in therapy."

        "text": "EpCAM and the biology of hepatic stem/progenitor cells.\nEpithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) is a transmembrane glycoprotein, which is frequently and highly expressed on carcinomas, tumor-initiating cells, selected tissue progenitors, and embryonic and adult stem cells. During liver development, EpCAM demonstrates a dynamic expression, since it can be detected in fetal liver, including cells of the parenchyma, whereas mature hepatocytes are devoid of EpCAM. Liver regeneration is associated with a population of EpCAM-positive cells within ductular reactions, which gradually lose the expression of EpCAM along with maturation into hepatocytes. EpCAM can be switched on and off through a wide panel of strategies to fine-tune EpCAM-dependent functional and differentiative traits. EpCAM-associated functions relate to cell-cell adhesion, proliferation, maintenance of a pluripotent state, regulation of differentiation, migration, and invasion. These functions can be conferred by the full-length protein and/or EpCAM-derived fragments, which are generated upon regulated intramembrane proteolysis. Control by EpCAM therefore not only depends on the presence of full-length EpCAM at cellular membranes but also on varying rates of the formation of EpCAM-derived fragments that have their own regulatory properties and on changes in the association of EpCAM with interaction partners. Thus spatiotemporal localization of EpCAM in immature liver progenitors, transit-amplifying cells, and mature liver cells will decisively impact the regulation of EpCAM functions and might be one of the triggers that contributes to the adaptive processes in stem/progenitor cell lineages. This review will summarize EpCAM-related molecular events and how they relate to hepatobiliary differentiation and regeneration. "

In humans, however, undesirable, excessive or chronic pain is a common and major societal burden for which available medical treatments are currently suboptimal. New therapeutic options have recently been derived from studies of individuals with congenital insensitivity to pain (CIP). Here we identified 10 different homozygous mutations in PRDM12 (encoding PRDI-BF1 and RIZ homology domain-containing protein 12) in subjects with CIP from 11 families. Prdm proteins are a family of epigenetic regulators that control neural specification and neurogenesis. We determined that Prdm12 is expressed in nociceptors and their progenitors and participates in the development of sensory neurons in Xenopus embryos. Moreover, CIP-associated mutants abrogate the histone-modifying potential associated with wild-type Prdm12. Prdm12 emerges as a key factor in the orchestration of sensory neurogenesis and may hold promise as a target for new pain therapeutics. "

METHODS: Immunohistochemical study for EpCAM and E-cadherin was carried out in 91 cases of papillary thyroid carcinoma. Twenty-four cases of papillary hyperplasia of thyroid were used as controls. RESULTS: In all of the 24 cases of papillary hyperplasia, EpCAM was located on the cell membrane, while in the 91 cases of papillary thyroid carcinoma studied, EpCAM was located within the cytoplasm, with 36.3% (33/91) showing nuclear localization as well. In all the papillary hyperplasia cases studied, E-cadherin showed membranous expression. E-cadherin expression was reduced in 84.6% (77/91) of papillary thyroid carcinoma, as compared with the surrounding native thyroid parenchyma. Amongst the 33 cases of papillary thyroid carcinoma which showed nuclear localization of EpCAM, 30 cases also showed reduced E-cadherin expression. There was a positive correlation between nuclear expression of EpCAM and loss of E-cadherin expression (P = 0.000; Spearman correlation coefficient = 0.857). Nuclear expression of EpCAM correlated with follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma and presence of extrathyroidal extension ( P = 0.037 and 0.033, respectively). Loss of E-cadherin expression correlated with age of patients and presence of lymph node metastasis (P = 0.018 and 0.010, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: E-cadherin expression is reduced in papillary thyroid carcinoma, as compared with native thyroid parenchyma and papillary hyperplasia. Papillary thyroid carcinoma shows loss of EpCAM membranous expression and increased cytoplasmic/nuclear accumulation. Detection of these two markers may provide a valuable reference in defining the biologic behaviors of papillary thyroid carcinoma, including extrathyroidal extension and lymph node metastasis."

        "text": "Nucleosome Organization in Human Embryonic Stem Cells.\nThe fundamental repeating unit of eukaryotic chromatin is the nucleosome. Besides being involved in packaging DNA, nucleosome organization plays an important role in transcriptional regulation and cellular identity. Currently, there is much debate about the major determinants of the nucleosome architecture of a genome and its significance with little being known about its role in stem cells. To address these questions, we performed ultra-deep sequencing of nucleosomal DNA in two human embryonic stem cell lines and integrated our data with numerous epigenomic maps. Our analyses have revealed that the genome is a determinant of nucleosome organization with transcriptionally inactive regions characterized by a \"ground state\" of nucleosome profiles driven by underlying DNA sequences. DNA sequence preferences are associated with heterogeneous chromatin organization around transcription start sites. Transcription, histone modifications, and DNA methylation alter this \"ground state\" by having distinct effects on both nucleosome positioning and occupancy. As the transcriptional rate increases, nucleosomes become better positioned. Exons transcribed and included in the final spliced mRNA have distinct nucleosome profiles in comparison to exons not included at exon-exon junctions. Genes marked by the active modification H3K4m3 are characterized by lower nucleosome occupancy before the transcription start site compared to genes marked by the inactive modification H3K27m3, while bivalent domains, genes associated with both marks, lie exactly in the middle. Combinatorial patterns of epigenetic marks (chromatin states) are associated with unique nucleosome profiles. Nucleosome organization varies around transcription factor binding in enhancers versus promoters. DNA methylation is associated with increasing nucleosome occupancy and different types of methylations have distinct location preferences within the nucleosome core particle. Finally, computational analysis of nucleosome organization alone is sufficient to elucidate much of the circuitry of pluripotency. Our results, suggest that nucleosome organization is associated with numerous genomic and epigenomic processes and can be used to elucidate cellular identity. "

Their function is strongly linked to sperm head morphology and male fertility. Protamines appear to be affected by a complex pattern of selective constraints. Previous studies showed that sexual selection affects protamine coding sequence and expression in rodents. Here we analyze selective constraints and post-copulatory sexual selection acting on protamine 2 (Prm2) gene sequences of 53 species of primates and rodents. We focused on possible differences in selective constraints between these two clades and on the two functional domains of PRM2 (cleaved- and mature-PRM2). We also assessed if and how changes in Prm2 coding sequence may affect sperm head dimensions. RESULTS: The domain of Prm2 that is cleaved off during binding to DNA (cleaved-Prm2) was found to be under purifying selection in both clades, whereas the domain that remains bound to DNA (mature-Prm2) was found to be positively selected in primates and under relaxed constraint in rodents. Changes in cleaved-Prm2 coding sequence are significantly correlated to sperm head width and elongation in rodents. Contrary to expectations, a significant effect of sexual selection was not found on either domain or clade. CONCLUSIONS: Mature-PRM2 may be free to evolve under less constraint due to the existence of PRM1 as a more conserved and functionally redundant copy. The cleaved-PRM2 domain seems to play an important role in sperm head shaping. However, sexual selection on its sequence may be difficult to detect until it is identified which sperm head phenotype (shape and size) confers advantages for sperm performance in different mammalian clades."

One direct and powerful way to assess the genetic causality behind GWAS is through analysis of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). Here we describe a new approach to estimate the tissues behind the genetic causality of a variety of GWAS traits, using the cis-eQTLs in 44 tissues from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Consortium. We have adapted the regulatory trait concordance (RTC) score to measure the probability of eQTLs being active in multiple tissues and to calculate the probability that a GWAS-associated variant and an eQTL tag the same functional effect. By normalizing the GWAS-eQTL probabilities by the tissue-sharing estimates for eQTLs, we generate relative tissue-causality profiles for GWAS traits. Our approach not only implicates the gene likely mediating individual GWAS signals, but also highlights tissues where the genetic causality for an individual trait is likely manifested."

Despite this, a proportion of patients still do not respond or lose response over time. Bispecific antibodies target two different cytokines simultaneously, potentially offering a better disease control. Interleukin (IL)-17A and IL-17F share structural homology and have similar biologic function.

Although in the last decades new treatment options have led to a better management of this disease, there are still significant unmet therapeutic needs. Dual inhibitor antibodies target two different cytokines simultaneously, potentially offering a better disease control. In psoriatic arthritis, there is evidence for a pathogenic role not only of IL-17A but also the structurally homologous IL-17F. It is postulated that differential expression of both in several targets of PsA could account for disparities in clinical response to IL-17A inhibition alone (such as with secukinumab or ixekizumab). Here we review the evidence so far for the use in psoriatic arthritis of bimekizumab, the first humanized monoclonal IgG1 antibody that selectively neutralizes both IL-17A and IL-17F.

Insect herbivores exposed to these insecticides have been able to rapidly evolve resistance to them, but how they are able to do so is poorly understood. One possible but largely unexplored explanation is that exposure to sublethal doses of insecticides may alter epigenetic patterns that are heritable. For instance, epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation that modifies gene expression without changing the underlying genetic code, may facilitate the emergence of resistant phenotypes in complex ways. We assessed the effects of sublethal insecticide exposure, with the neonicotinoid imidacloprid, on DNA methylation in the Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata, examining both global changes in DNA methylation and specific changes found within genes and transposable elements. We found that exposure to insecticide led to decreases in global DNA methylation for parent and F2 generations and that many of the sites of changes in methylation are found within genes associated with insecticide resistance, such as cytochrome P450s, or within transposable elements. Exposure to sublethal doses of insecticide caused heritable changes in DNA methylation in an agricultural insect herbivore. Therefore, epigenetics may play a role in insecticide resistance, highlighting a fundamental mechanism of evolution while informing how we might better coexist with insect species in agroecosystems."

In this study, in-silico studies of hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs (ascorbic acid: Asc and curcumin: Cur) interactions and release were investigated and validated by a set of in vitro experiments to reveal the significant improvement in breast cancer therapy using a co-delivery approach by niosomal nanocarrier. The niosomal nanoparticles containing surfactants (Span 60 and Tween 60) and cholesterol at 2:1 M ratio were prepared through the film hydration method. A systematic evaluation of nanoniosomes was carried out. The release profile demonstrated two phases (initial burst followed by sustained release) and a pH-dependent release schedule over 72 h. The optimized niosomal preparation displayed superior storage stability for up to 2 months at 4  C, exhibiting extremely minor changes in pharmaceutical encapsulation efficiency and size. Free dual drugs (Asc + Cur) and dual-drug loaded niosomes (Niosomal (Asc + Cur)) enhanced the apoptotic activity and cytotoxicity and inhibited cell migration which confirmed the synergistic effect of co-encapsulated drugs. Also, significant up-regulation of p53 and Bax genes was observed in cells treated with Asc + Cur and Niosomal (Asc + Cur), while the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 gene was down-regulated. These results were in correlation with the increase in the enzyme activity of SOD, CAT, and caspase, and the levels of MDA and ROS upon treatment with the mentioned drugs. Furthermore, these anti-cancer effects were higher when using Niosomal (Asc + Cur) than Asc + Cur. Histopathological examination also revealed that Niosomal (Asc + Cur) had a lower mitosis index, invasion, and pleomorphism than Asc + Cur. These findings indicated that niosomal formulation for co-delivery of Asc and Cur would offer a promising delivery system for an effective breast cancer treatment."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial comparing enalapril to placebo in 135 long-term survivors of pediatric cancer who had at least one cardiac abnormality identified at any time after anthracycline exposure. RESULTS: There was no difference in the rate of change in MCI per year between enalapril and placebo groups (0.30 v 0.18 L/min/m(2); P =.55). However, during the first year of treatment, the rate of change in LVESWS was greater in the enalapril group than in the placebo group (-8.59 v 1.85 g/cm(2); P =.033) and this difference was maintained over the study period, resulting in a 9% reduction in estimated LVESWS by year 5 in the enalapril group. Six of seven patients removed from random assignment to treatment because of cardiac deterioration were initially treated with placebo (P =.11), and one has died as a result of heart failure. Side effects from enalapril included dizziness or hypotension (22% v 3% in the placebo group; P =.0003) and fatigue (10% v 0%; P =.013). CONCLUSION: Enalapril treatment did not influence exercise performance, but did reduce LVESWS in the first year; this reduction was maintained over the study period. Any theoretical benefits of LVESWS reduction in this anthracycline-exposed population must be weighed against potential side effects from ACE inhibitors when making treatment decisions."

HLA B*5701 is a known genetic risk factor for abacavir hypersensitivity in Caucasians. Our aim was to confirm the presence of this genetic factor in our patients, and to determine whether genotyping for HLA B*5701 would be a cost-effective use of healthcare resources. METHODS: Patients with and without abacavir hypersensitivity were identified from a UK HIV clinic. Patients were genotyped for HLA B*5701, and pooled data used for calculation of test characteristics. The cost-effectiveness analysis incorporated the cost of testing, cost of treating abacavir hypersensitivity, and the cost and selection of alternative antiretroviral regimens. A probabilistic decision analytic model (comparing testing versus no testing) was formulated and Monte Carlo simulations performed. RESULTS: Of the abacavir hypersensitive patients, six (46%) were HLA B*5701 positive, compared to five (10%) of the non-hypersensitive patients (odds ratio 7.9 [95% confidence intervals 1.5-41.4], P = 0.006). Pooling of our data on HLA B*5701 with published data resulted in a pooled odds ratio of 29 (95% CI 6.4-132.3; P < 0.0001). The cost-effectiveness model demonstrated that depending on the choice of comparator, routine testing for HLA B*5701 ranged from being a dominant strategy (less expensive and more beneficial than not testing) to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (versus no testing) of Euro 22,811 per hypersensitivity reaction avoided. CONCLUSIONS: Abacavir hypersensitivity is associated with HLA B*5701, and pre-prescription pharmacogenetic testing for this appears to be a cost-effective use of healthcare resources."

Mutations in the voltage-gated potassium channel subunit KCNQ1 induce the most common form of LQTS. KCNQ1 is associated with two different entities of LQTS, the autosomal-dominant Romano-Ward syndrome (RWS), and the autosomal-recessive Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome (JLNS) characterized by bilateral deafness in addition to cardiac arrhythmias. In this study, we investigate and discuss dominant-negative I(Ks) current reduction by a KCNQ1 deletion mutation identified in a RWS family. METHODS: Single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and direct sequencing were used to screen LQTS genes for mutations. Mutant KCNQ1 channels were heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes, and potassium currents were recorded using the two-microelectrode voltage clamp technique. RESULTS: A heterozygous deletion of three nucleotides (CTT) identified in the KCNQ1 gene caused the loss of a single phenylalanine residue at position 339 (KCNQ1-deltaF339). Electrophysiological measurements in the presence and absence of the regulatory beta-subunit KCNE1 revealed that mutant and wild type forms of an N-terminal truncated KCNQ1 subunit (isoform 2) caused much stronger dominant-negative current reduction than the mutant form of the full-length KCNQ1 subunit (isoform 1).

In the RWS family presented here, the autosomal-dominant trait is caused by multiple dominant-negative effects provoked by heteromultimeric channels formed by wild type and mutant KCNQ1-isoforms in combination with KCNE1."

Our morphometric study assesses the effectiveness of the anterior clinoidectomy for exposure of the C6 segment of the ICA. METHODS: Ten formalin-fixed adult cadaveric heads were dissected bilaterally and pterional craniotomies were performed bilaterally. Measurements before and after resection of the ACP included the length of C6 segment of the ICA on its lateral aspect; C6 segment length on its medial aspect; and medial length of the optic nerve from the optic chiasm to falciform ligament (before ACP resection) then to the annulus of Zinn (after ACP resection). FINDINGS: Height and width of the intradural ACP were 8.67 +/- 2.63 and 6.57 +/- 1.68 mm, respectively. After clinoidectomy, mean length of the lateral C6 segment of the ICA increased 60% and mean exposure of the medial C6 segment of the ICA increased 113% (p < 0.001). Exposure of the optic nerve increased 150% (p < 0.001) after clinoidectomy and sectioning of the falciform ligament. No correlations were found between the lengths of the ACP and entire C6 segment, or the ACP size and amount of the C6 segment covered by the clinoid. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure of the C6 segment of the ICA is markedly increased by increase of the mobility of the optic nerve with clinoidectomy and section of the falciform ligament."

Altered Na(+) channel gating is linked to and may promote ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VTs) in HF. Calmodulin regulates Na(+) channel gating, in part perhaps via CaMKII. We investigated effects of adenovirus-mediated (acute) and Tg (chronic) overexpression of cytosolic CaMKIIdelta(C) on Na(+) current (I(Na)) in rabbit and mouse ventricular myocytes, respectively (in whole-cell patch clamp). Both acute and chronic CaMKIIdelta(C) overexpression shifted voltage dependence of Na(+) channel availability by -6 mV (P < 0.05), and the shift was Ca(2+) dependent. CaMKII also enhanced intermediate inactivation and slowed recovery from inactivation (prevented by CaMKII inhibitors autocamtide 2-related inhibitory peptide [AIP] or KN93). CaMKIIdelta(C) markedly increased persistent (late) inward I(Na) and intracellular Na(+) concentration (as measured by the Na(+) indicator sodium-binding benzofuran isophthalate [SBFI]), which was prevented by CaMKII inhibition in the case of acute CaMKIIdelta(C) overexpression. CaMKII coimmunoprecipitates with and phosphorylates Na(+) channels. In vivo, transgenic CaMKIIdelta(C) overexpression prolonged QRS duration and repolarization (QT intervals), decreased effective refractory periods, and increased the propensity to develop VT. We conclude that CaMKII associates with and phosphorylates cardiac Na(+) channels. This alters I(Na) gating to reduce availability at high heart rate, while enhancing late I(Na) (which could prolong action potential duration). In mice, enhanced CaMKIIdelta(C) activity predisposed to VT. Thus, CaMKII-dependent regulation of Na(+) channel function may contribute to arrhythmogenesis in HF."

In these cases DBA is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait and RPS19 haploinsufficiency is thought to cause the disease. To study the molecular pathogenesis of DBA we used siRNA to decrease the level of RPS19 in two human cell lines, HeLa cells and U-2 OS osteosarcoma cells. Cells with reduced RPS19 levels showed a dramatic reduction in the amounts of small 40S ribosome subunits and mature 80S ribosomes and an excess of large 60S subunits. These cells were defective in 18S rRNA production and accumulated 21S and 20S nuclear pre-rRNA molecules, suggesting that RPS19 is required for specific steps in rRNA processing. RPS19 depletion produced a reduction in steady-state levels of RPS6 and RPS16 via a post-transcriptional mechanism while the levels of RPL7 and RPL26 were unaltered, indicating that levels of ribosomal proteins are determined by subunit assembly. This has interesting implications for the pathogenesis of DBA suggesting that deficiency of any of the RPS proteins might have a similar effect and thus may be responsible for causing DBA. Finally in cell lines from DBA patients with mutations we find increased levels of 21S rRNA precursors but no abnormality in the ribosome profile on sucrose gradients or in the steady-state levels of RPS19 suggesting that some cells can partially compensate for the loss of one allele of RPS19. We conclude that defects in ribosome biogenesis may underlie the pathology of Diamond Blackfan Anemia."

All cognitively-capable children with previously treated hydrocephalus who were aged between 6 and 19 years were eligible. Parents completed the HOQ and the Health Utilities Index Mark 3; children completed the cHOQ. A total of 273 children participated (146 males, 127 females; mean age 14 y 1 mo, SD 2 y 7 mo). Internal consistency of the cHOQ was 0.93 and test-retest reliability was 0.86 (95% confidence interval 0.78-0.92). Mother-child agreement and father-child agreement were 0.57 (0.40-0.68) and 0.62 (0.48-0.73) respectively. Agreement was higher for assessments of physical health, but lower for assessments of cognitive health and social-emotional health. There was greater parent-child agreement for older children. When there was disagreement, it seemed that children tended to rate their health better than their parents did. In older children with hydrocephalus, the cHOQ appears to be a scientifically reliable means of assessing long-term outcome. The differences in child and parent perceptions of health need to be appreciated when conducting outcome studies in this population."

We investigated whether sevoflurane-induced postconditioning is also blocked in the prediabetic heart and if so, whether cardioprotection could be restored by inhibiting mPTP. METHODS AND RESULTS: Zucker lean (ZL) and Zucker obese (ZO) rats were assigned to one of seven groups. Animals underwent 25 min of ischaemia and 120 min of reperfusion. Control (ZL-/ZO Con) animals were not further treated. postconditioning groups (ZL-/ZO Sevo-post) received sevoflurane for 5 min starting 1min prior to the onset of reperfusion. The mPTP inhibitor cyclosporine A (CsA) was administered intravenously in a concentration of 5 (ZO CsA and ZO CsA+Sevo-post) or 10 mg/kg (ZO CsA10+Sevo-post) 5 min before the onset of reperfusion. At the end of reperfusion, infarct sizes were measured by TTC staining. Blood samples were collected to measure plasma levels of insulin, cholesterol and triglycerides. Sevoflurane postconditioning reduced infarct size in ZL rats to 35+-12% (p<0.05 vs. ZL Con: 60+-6%). In ZO rats sevoflurane postconditioning was abolished (ZO Sevo-post: 59+-12%, n.s. vs. ZO Con: 58+-6%). 5 mg and 10 mg CsA could not restore cardioprotection (ZO CsA+Sevo-post: 59+-7%, ZO CsA10+Sevo-post: 57+-14%; n.s. vs. ZO Con). In ZO rats insulin, cholesterol and triglyceride levels were significant higher than in ZL rats (all p<0.05).

There is extensive experimental evidence to support investigation of therapeutic hypothermia in infants with these conditions. We aimed to establish the feasibility and safety of mild hypothermia in preterm neonates with NEC and MODS as a prelude to a randomized trial. METHODS: This was a prospective, nonrandomized pilot study of 15 preterm infants who were referred for surgical intervention of advanced NEC and failure of at least 3 organs. Whole-body cooling was achieved by ambient temperature adjustment with or without cooling mattress. Three groups (n = 5 per group) were cooled to core temperatures of 35.5 degrees C (+/-0.5 degrees C), 34.5 degrees C, and 33.5 degrees C, respectively, for 48 hours before rewarming to 37 degrees C. Infants were carefully assessed to identify adverse effects that potentially were related to cooling and rewarming. A noncooled group (n = 10) with advanced surgical NEC and MODS was used for comparison. Data are medians (interquartile range). RESULTS: Gestational age at birth was 27 weeks (26-30), admission weight was 1.1 kg (1.0-1.7), and admission age was 31 days (12-45). Core temperature was maintained within target range for 90% (88%-97%) of the intended time. Statistically significant relationships were identified between core temperature and heart rate (P < .0001), pH (P < .0001), base excess (P = .003), and blood clot dynamics (longer time to initial clot formation, slower rate of clot formation, and decrease in clot strength; all P < .001) as assessed by thromboelastography. No major clinical problems or adverse events were noted during cooling or rewarming. Comparison with the noncooled group revealed no increase in mortality, bleeding, infection, or need for inotropes in infants who were cooled. CONCLUSIONS: Mild hypothermia for 48 hours in preterm neonates with severe NEC seems both feasible and safe. Additional investigation of the efficacy of this therapeutic intervention in this population is warranted."

It shows phenotypic overlap with Costello syndrome and cardio-facio-cutaneous (CFC) syndrome. Noonan syndrome and related disorders are caused by germline mutations in genes encoding molecules in the RAS/MAPK pathway. Recently, a gain-of-function mutation in SHOC2, p.S2G, has been identified as causative for a type of Noonan-like syndrome characterized by the presence of loose anagen hair. In order to understand the contribution of SHOC2 mutations to the clinical manifestations of Noonan syndrome and related disorders, we analyzed SHOC2 in 92 patients with Noonan syndrome and related disorders who did not exhibit PTPN11, KRAS, HRAS, BRAF, MAP2K1/2, SOS1 or RAF1 mutations. We found the previously identified p.S2G mutation in eight of our patients. We developed a rapid detection system to identify the p.S2G mutation using melting curve analysis, which will be a useful tool to screen for the apparently common mutation. All the patients with the p.S2G mutation showed short stature, sparse hair and atopic skin. Six of the mutation-positive patients showed severe mental retardation and easily pluckable hair, and one showed leukocytosis. No SHOC2 mutations were identified in leukemia cells from 82 leukemia patients. These results suggest that clinical manifestations in SHOC2 mutation-positive patients partially overlap with those in patients with typical Noonan or CFC syndrome and show that easily pluckable/loose anagen hair is distinctive in SHOC2 mutation-positive patients."

Calcium is actively accumulated in the endoplasmic reticulum by Sarco/Endoplasmic Reticulum Calcium transport ATPases (SERCA enzymes). SERCA-dependent calcium transport is the only calcium uptake mechanism in this organelle, and therefore the regulation of SERCA function by the cell constitutes a key mechanism to adjust calcium homeostasis in the endoplasmic reticulum depending on the cell type and its state of differentiation. The direct pharmacological modulation of SERCA activity affects cell differentiation and survival. SERCA expression levels can undergo significant changes during cell differentiation or tumorigenesis, leading to modified endoplasmic reticulum calcium storage. In several cell types such as cells of hematopoietic origin or various epithelial cells, two SERCA genes (SERCA2 and SERCA3) are simultaneously expressed. Expression levels of SERCA3, a lower calcium affinity calcium pump are highly variable. In several cell systems SERCA3 expression is selectively induced during differentiation, whereas during tumorigenesis and blastic transformation SERCA3 expression is decreased. These observations point at the existence of a cross-talk, via the regulation of SERCA3 levels, between endoplasmic reticulum calcium homeostasis and the control of cell differentiation, and show that endoplasmic reticulum calcium homeostasis itself can undergo remodeling during differentiation. The investigation of the anomalies of endoplasmic reticulum differentiation in tumor and leukemia cells may be useful for a better understanding of the contribution of calcium signaling to the establishment of malignant phenotypes."

In multiple myeloma (MM), aberrant auto-and/or paracrine activation of canonical Wnt signaling promotes proliferation and dissemination, while overexpression of the Wnt inhibitor Dickkopf1 (DKK1) by MM cells contributes to osteolytic bone disease by inhibiting osteoblast differentiation. Since DKK1 itself is a target of TCF/beta-catenin mediated transcription, these findings suggest that DKK1 is part of a negative feedback loop in MM and may act as a tumor suppressor. In line with this hypothesis, we show here that DKK1 expression is low or undetectable in a subset of patients with advanced MM as well as in MM cell lines. This absence of DKK1 is correlated with enhanced Wnt pathway activation, evidenced by nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin, which in turn can be antagonized by restoring DKK1 expression. Analysis of the DKK1 promoter revealed CpG island methylation in several MM cell lines as well as in MM cells from patients with advanced MM. Moreover, demethylation of the DKK1 promoter restores DKK1 expression, which results in inhibition of beta-catenin/TCF-mediated gene transcription in MM lines. Taken together, our data identify aberrant methylation of the DKK1 promoter as a cause of DKK1 silencing in advanced stage MM, which may play an important role in the progression of MM by unleashing Wnt signaling."

This depends on specific cis-regulatory elements distributed in the noncoding DNA surrounding their target genes. Studies performed on mammalian embryonic stem cells and Drosophila embryos suggest that active enhancers form part of a defined chromatin landscape marked by histone H3 lysine 4 mono-methylation (H3K4me1) and histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac). Nevertheless, little is known about the dynamics and the potential roles of these marks during vertebrate embryogenesis. Here, we provide genomic maps of H3K4me1/me3 and H3K27ac at four developmental time-points of zebrafish embryogenesis and analyze embryonic enhancer activity. We find that (1) changes in H3K27ac enrichment at enhancers accompany the shift from pluripotency to tissue-specific gene expression, (2) in early embryos, the peaks of H3K27ac enrichment are bound by pluripotent factors such as Nanog, and (3) the degree of evolutionary conservation is higher for enhancers that become marked by H3K27ac at the end of gastrulation, suggesting their implication in the establishment of the most conserved (phylotypic) transcriptome that is known to occur later at the pharyngula stage."

The recent discovery that mutations in the gene encoding for progranulin (GRN) cause frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), and other neurodegenerative diseases leading to dementia, has brought renewed interest in progranulin and its functions in the central nervous system. GRN null mutations cause protein haploinsufficiency, leading to a significant decrease in progranulin levels that can be detected in plasma, serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of mutation carriers. The dosage of circulating progranulin sped up the identification of GRN mutations thus favoring genotype-phenotype correlation studies. Researchers demonstrated that, in GRN null mutation carriers, the shortage of progranulin invariably precedes clinical symptoms and thus mutation carriers are \"captured\" regardless of their disease status. GRN is a particularly appealing gene for drug targeting, in the way that boosting its expression may be beneficial for mutation carriers, preventing or delaying the onset of GRN-related neurodegenerative diseases. Physiological regulation of progranulin expression level is only partially known. Progranulin expression reflects mutation status and, intriguingly, its levels can be modulated by some additional factor (i.e. genetic background; drugs). Thus, factors increasing the production and secretion of progranulin from the normal gene are promising potential therapeutic avenues. In conclusion, peripheral progranulin is a nonintrusive highly accurate biomarker for early identification of mutation carriers and for monitoring future treatments that might boost the level of this protein."

We performed a prospective head-to-head comparison of the diagnostic accuracy of both fecal calprotectin (fCal) and neopterin (fNeo), and serum C-reactive protein in predicting endoscopic disease severity in patients with IBD. METHODS: A total of 133 consecutive patients with IBD (78 Crohn's disease [CD] and 55 ulcerative colitis [UC]) undergoing a colonoscopy provided fecal samples for the measurement of fCal and fNeo concentrations and a blood sample for the serum C-reactive protein measurement. Endoscopic disease activities were scored independently according to the Simple Endoscopic Score for CD in patients with CD and to the Rachmilewitz Index in patients with UC. The respective performances of the fecal markers with respect to endoscopic disease severity were assessed by computing correlations, sensitivities, specificities, and overall accuracies at adjusted cutoffs and also test operating characteristics. RESULTS: The fCal and fNeo concentrations differed significantly in clinically and endoscopically active IBD when compared with those in patients with inactive disease. Both fCal and fNeo concentrations correlated closer with endoscopic scores in UC (r = 0.75 and r = 0.72, respectively; P < 0.0001 for both) than in CD (r = 0.53 and r = 0.47, respectively; P < 0.0001 for both). Using cutoffs of 250 mug/g for fCal and 200 pmol/g for fNeo, both fecal markers had similar overall accuracies to predict endoscopic activity in patients with CD (74%) and also a higher and similar accuracies (88% and 90%, respectively) in patients with UC, whereas accuracies of C-reactive protein were slightly lower in patients with CD and UC. CONCLUSIONS: The fNeo is a novel reliable surrogate biomarker with the potential to identify patients with IBD with active mucosal lesions and represents an alternative marker as accurate as fCal to predict and monitor the severity of mucosal damages in patients with IBD."

One way to do this is to find a gene that is associated with several pathways; this approach expands the possibilities for disease targeting and enables multiple points of attack rather than one fixed point, which does not allow treatment to evolve over time as cancer does. Inducing programmed cell death (PCD) is a promising method to prevent or inhibit the progression of tumor cells.

It was reported that DP could induce apoptosis in human prostate cancer, human gastric tumor cells and human melanoma, but the cytotoxic effect of DP on human breast cancer was not investigated. This study would investigate whether DP was a candidate chemical of anti-human breast cancer. METHODS: The MTT assay reflected the number of viable cells through measuring the activity of cellular enzymes. Phase contrast microscopy visualized cell morphology. Fluorescence microscopy detected nuclear fragmentation after Hoechst 33258 staining. Flowcytometric analysis of Annexin V-PI staining and Rodamine 123 staining was used to detect cell apoptosis and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). Real time PCR detected mRNA level. Western blot examined protein expression. RESULTS: DP dose and time-dependently inhibited the growth of MCF-7 cells. DP inhibited MCF-7 cell growth through apoptosis. DP regulated the expression of Bcl-2 and Bax, which were mitochondrial pathway proteins, to decrease MMP, and DP promoted the transcription of Bax and inhibited Bcl-2. Apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) and cytochrome c which localized in mitochondrial in physiological condition were released into cytoplasm when MMP was decreased. DP activated caspase-9, which was the downstream of mitochondrial pathway. Therefore DP decreased MMP to release AIF and cytochrome c into cytoplasm, further activating caspase 9, lastly led to apoptosis.

RESULTS: The weight of clinical evidence suggests a worsening effect of statins on insulin resistance and secretion, anyway basic science studies did not find a clear molecular explanation, providing conflicting evidence regarding both the beneficial and the adverse effects of statin therapy on insulin sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: Although most of the clinical studies suggest a worsening of insulin resistance and secretion, the cardiovascular benefits of statin therapy outweigh the risk of developing insulin resistance, thus the data suggest the need to treat dyslipidemia and to make patients aware of the possible risk of developing type 2 diabetes or, if they already are diabetic, of worsening their metabolic control."

METHODS: In a cross-sectional descriptive study, 45 patients with acute IS were selected. Patients with their first day of stroke were included in the study. National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) for stroke severity were evaluated on Days 1, 5, 90, and 365. Serum IL-6 level was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) on days 1 and 5. RESULTS: In the present study, 45 patients with a mean age of 77.6 +- 4.9 including 32 (71%) men and 13 (28.9%) women were studied. Death occurred in 2 (4.4%) patients before discharge from the hospital; the others, be that as it may, followed the study until Day 365 with a mortality rate of 6 (13.3%). A positive significant correlation was found between IL-6, and NIHSS and mRS of the patients from the time of admission to the end of the follow-up period (P < 0.001, r = 0.6). Moreover, there was a significant correlation between IL-6 and infarction size in brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan (P < 0.001, r = 0.7). CONCLUSION: The evidence from the present study suggests that IL-6 contributes to determination of severity of ischemic stroke. In addition, IL-6 concentrations affect clinical outcomes in ischemic stroke."

Here we have functionally characterised the importance of the AREs present within the Bcl2 3'UTR in order to maintain Bcl2 expression. Gene targeting deletion of 300 nucleotides of the Bcl2 3'UTR rich in AREs diminishes Bcl2 mRNA stability and protein levels in primary B cells, decreasing cell lifespan. Generation of chimeric mice indicates that Bcl2-ARE /  B cells have an intrinsic competitive disadvantage compared to wild type cells. Biochemical assays and predictions using a bioinformatics approach show that several RBPs bind to the Bcl2 AREs, including AUF1 and HuR proteins. Altogether, association of RBPs to Bcl2 AREs contributes to Bcl2 protein expression by stabilizing Bcl2 mRNA and promotes B cell maintenance. "

To map fission yeast centromeres, we applied H4S47C-anchored cleavage mapping and native and cross-linked chromatin immunoprecipitation with paired-end sequencing. H3 nucleosomes are nearly absent from the central domain, which is occupied by centromere-specific H3 (cenH3 or CENP-A) nucleosomes with two H4s per particle that are mostly unpositioned and are more widely spaced than nucleosomes elsewhere. Inner kinetochore proteins CENP-A, CENP-C, CENP-T, CENP-I, and Scm3 are highly enriched throughout the central domain except at tRNA genes, with no evidence for preferred kinetochore assembly sites. These proteins are weakly enriched and less stably incorporated in H3-rich heterochromatin. CENP-A nucleosomes protect less DNA from nuclease digestion than H3 nucleosomes, while CENP-T protects a range of fragment sizes. Our results suggest that CENP-T particles occupy linkers between CENP-A nucleosomes and that classical regional centromeres differ from other centromeres by the absence of CENP-A nucleosome positioning.

We hypothesized that a blood-based transcriptional signature could be discovered indicating a host systemic response to viral infection. Previous work identified host transcriptional signatures to individual viruses including influenza, respiratory syncytial virus and dengue, but the generality of these signatures across all viral infection types has not been established. Based on 44 publicly available datasets and two clinical studies of our own design, we discovered and validated a four-gene expression signature in whole blood, indicative of a general host systemic response to many types of viral infection. The signature's genes are: Interferon Stimulated Gene 15 (ISG15), Interleukin 16 (IL16), 2',5'-Oligoadenylate Synthetase Like (OASL), and Adhesion G Protein Coupled Receptor E5 (ADGRE5). In each of 13 validation datasets encompassing human, macaque, chimpanzee, pig, mouse, rat and all seven Baltimore virus classification groups, the signature provides statistically significant (p < 0.05) discrimination between viral and non-viral conditions. The signature may have clinical utility for differentiating host systemic inflammation (SI) due to viral versus bacterial or non-infectious causes."

We isolated primary epididymal epithelial cells from rat epididymides and verified their phenotype by detecting the presence of cytokeratin-19 (CK-19, an epithelial cell marker) and the absence vimentin (an interstitial cell marker). We found that cultured epididymal epithelial cells isolated from rat epididymides expressed high levels of CK-19 but barely expressed vimentin. Gain-of-function assays, which included the CCK-8 assay and EdU flow cytometry assay, indicated that overexpression of OCTN2 significantly promoted epididymal epithelial cell growth and proliferation. Moreover, forced expression of OCTN2 inhibited the cell apoptosis process, and at the same time increased expression of the pro-apoptosis factor BAX, and decreased expression of the anti-apoptosis factors BCL-2 and Survivin. Furthermore, we also found that OCTN2 overexpression dramatically increased the levels of biomarkers associated with spermatogenesis, including azoospermia-like (DAZL), phosphoglycerate kinase 2 (PGK2), and protamine 2 (PRM2). These results demonstrate that OCTN2 plays a positive role in epididymal epithelial cells, and might be useful in the clinical treatment of male infertility by serving as a key regulatory factor."

Recently, it was demonstrated by quantitative mass spectrometry that RhoGDIalpha is heavily targeted by post-translational lysine acetylation. For one site in its N-terminal domain, namely K52, we reported earlier that acetylation completely switches off RhoGDIalpha function. Herein we show that K52-acetylated RhoGDIalpha is specifically deacetylated by the sirtuin deacetylase Sirt2. We show that acetylation at K52 decelerates cervical cancer cell proliferation, suggesting RhoGDIalpha acetylation to be a promising therapeutic target. We demonstrate that treatment of cervical cancer cells with a RhoGDIalpha-derived K52-trifluoroacetylated, substrate-derived peptidic sirtuin inhibitor severely impairs cell proliferation. Finally, we conclude that the potency of substrate-derived sirtuin inhibitors depends on structural features, the substrate-derived amino acid sequence as a determinant for selectivity, as well as the presence of an acetyl-lysine analogue to increase its potency.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We evaluated the cellular kinetics of tisagenlecleucel, the effect of patient factors, humoral immunogenicity, and manufacturing attributes on its kinetics, and exposure-response analysis for efficacy, safety and pharmacodynamic endpoints in 79 patients across two studies in pediatric B-ALL (ELIANA and ENSIGN). RESULTS: Using quantitative polymerase chain reaction to quantify levels of tisagenlecleucel transgene, responders (N = 62) had  2-fold higher tisagenlecleucel expansion in peripheral blood than nonresponders (N = 8; 74% and 104% higher geometric mean Cmax and AUC0-28d, respectively) with persistence measurable beyond 2 years in responding patients. Cmax increased with occurrence and severity of cytokine release syndrome (CRS). Tisagenlecleucel continued to expand and persist following tocilizumab, used to manage CRS. Patients with B-cell recovery within 6 months had earlier loss of the transgene compared with patients with sustained clinical response. Clinical responses were seen across the entire dose range evaluated (patients <=50 kg: 0.2 to 5.0 x 106/kg; patients >50 kg: 0.1 to 2.5 x 108 CAR-positive viable T cells) with no relationship between dose and safety. Neither preexisting nor treatment-induced antimurine CAR19 antibodies affected the persistence or clinical response. CONCLUSIONS: Response to tisagenlecleucel was associated with increased expansion across a wide dose range. These results highlight the importance of cellular kinetics in understanding determinants of response to chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy."

METHODS: Adults with a recent history of recreational polydrug use, including stimulants, and who met criteria in a Qualification Phase were randomized to one of six sequences in a Test Phase. Each Test Phase sequence included a single administration of placebo, solriamfetol (300, 600, and 1200 mg), and phentermine (45 and 90 mg), with a two-day washout between periods. The primary endpoint was peak rating ( Emax) of Liking at the Moment across the first 12 h on a liking/disliking visual analog scale; key secondary endpoints were Next Day Overall Drug Liking, how much the participant would like to Take the Drug Again, and positive and negative subjective effects. Safety was also assessed throughout the study. RESULTS: Of 43 participants (74.4% male; mean age 29.3 years), 37 completed the study. Peak Emax Liking at the Moment for all solriamfetol doses was significantly greater than placebo and significantly less than phentermine 90 mg ( p < 0.05). Overall Next Day Drug Liking was greater than placebo for solriamfetol 300 mg and phentermine 45 and 90 mg ( p < 0.05). Willingness to Take the Drug Again was significantly greater than placebo and significantly less than both doses of phentermine for all doses of solriamfetol ( p < 0.05). Ratings of negative subjective effects (bad effects, disliking, anxiety, agitation) were higher with solriamfetol 600 and 1200 mg relative to phentermine. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events with solriamfetol were hypervigilance, elevated mood, dry mouth, hyperhidrosis, and insomnia.

Hypodysfibrinogenemia sharing features with hypo- and dysfibrinogenemia is rare. We performed genetic and functional analyses of a 31-year-old woman with suspected hypodysfibrinogenemia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Functional and antigenic fibrinogen values of patient were 1.05 and 1.24 g/L, respectively. DNA sequence and western blotting analyses for plasma fibrinogen were performed. A minigene incorporating the mutational region was transfected into a Chinese hamster ovary cell line (CHO), and reverse transcription products were analyzed. Assembly and secretion were examined using the recombinant variant fibrinogen. We purified the patient's plasma fibrinogen and analyzed thrombin-catalyzed fibrin polymerization (TCFP). RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: DNA sequencing revealed compound heterozygous nucleotide mutations with FGB 35 bp c.1245-17_1262 or -16_1263 del and FGB c.510T>A (resulting in Bbetap.N170K substitution) on different alleles. We did not detect shortened Bbeta-chain peptides in the plasma using western blotting analysis. A minigene incorporating the deletion DNA showed two aberrant mRNA products. The secretion of Bbetap.N170K-fibrinogen-CHO was almost same as normal Bbeta-fibrinogen-CHO. TCFP of plasma Bbetap.N170K fibrinogen was slightly lower than that of normal plasma fibrinogen. Aberrant splicing products derived from the 35 bp deletion caused hypofibrinogenemia due to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and suggested the presence of only Bbetap.N170K fibrinogen in patient's plasma. Bbetap.N170K caused dysfibrinogenemia due to a delay in lateral aggregation. These findings demonstrated that these mutations respectively affected the fibrinogen quality and quantity, resulting in hypodysfibrinogenemia."

We here delineated the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying novel immunomodulatory effects triggered by BCMA pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) antibody drug conjugate (ADC) MEDI2228 which can augment efficacy of these immunotherapies. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: MEDI2228-induced transcriptional and protein changes were investigated to define significantly impacted genes and signaling cascades in multiple myeloma cells. Mechanisms whereby MEDI2228 combination therapies can enhance cytotoxicity or overcome drug resistance in multiple myeloma cell lines and patient multiple myeloma cells were defined using in vitro models of tumor in the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment, as well as in human natural killer (NK)-reconstituted NOD/SCID gamma (NSG) mice bearing MM1S tumors. RESULTS: MEDI2228 enriched IFN I signaling and enhanced expression of IFN-stimulated genes in multiple myeloma cell lines following the induction of DNA damage-ATM/ATR-CHK1/2 pathways. It activated cGAS-STING-TBK1-IRF3 and STAT1-IRF1-signaling cascades and increased CD38 expression in multiple myeloma cells but did not increase CD38 expression in BCMA-negative NK effector cells. It overcame CD38 downregulation on multiple myeloma cells triggered by IL6 and patient BM stromal cell-culture supernatant via activation of STAT1-IRF1, even in immunomodulatory drug (IMiD)- and bortezomib-resistant multiple myeloma cells.

The limitations of current chemotherapeutic drugs in CRC include their toxicity, side effects, and exorbitant costs. To assess these unmet needs in CRC treatment, several naturally occurring compounds, including curcumin and andrographis, have gained increasing attention due to their multi-targeted functionality and safety vs. conventional drugs. In the current study, we revealed that a combination of curcumin and andrographis exhibited superior anti-tumor effects by inhibiting cell proliferation, invasion, colony formation, and inducing apoptosis. Genome-wide transcriptomic expression profiling analysis revealed that curcumin and andrographis activated the ferroptosis pathway. Moreover, we confirmed the gene and protein expression of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX-4) and ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 (FSP-1), the two major negative regulators of ferroptosis, were downregulated by this combined treatment. With this regimen, we also observed that intracellular accumulation of reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxides were induced in CRC cells. These cell line findings were validated in patient-derived organoids. In conclusion, our study revealed that combined treatment with curcumin and andrographis exhibited anti-tumorigenic effects in CRC cells through activation of ferroptosis and by dual suppression of GPX-4 and FSP-1, which have significant potential implications for the adjunctive treatment of CRC patients."

Uterine fibroid symptoms include abnormal menstrual bleeding leading to anaemia, tiredness, chronic vaginal discharge, and pain during periods. Other symptoms include protrusion of the abdomen, pain during intercourse, dysfunctions of bladder/bowel leading to urinary incontinence/retention, pain, and constipation. It is also associated with reproductive issues like impaired fertility, conceiving complications, and adverse obstetric outcomes. It is the leading cause of gynaecological hospitalisation in the American subcontinent and a common reason for the hysterectomy. Twenty-five percent of the reproductive women experience the symptoms of uterine fibroids, and among them, around 25% require hospitalization due to the severity of the disease. The frequency of the disease remains underestimated as many women stay asymptomatic and symptoms appear gradually; therefore, the condition remains undiagnosed.

Despite technological advances in insulin delivery, disease control remains suboptimal, while previous immunotherapy options have failed to prevent T1D. Recently, teplizumab, an immunomodulating monoclonal antibody, was approved to delay or prevent T1D. AREAS COVERED: Five randomized controlled trials have tested different regimens of administration, mostly 14-day schemes with dose escalation. In participants with new-onset T1D, teplizumab delayed C-peptide decline, improved glycemic control, and reduced insulin demand for a median of 1 or 2 years. Studies in at-risk relatives of patients showed a decrease in T1D incidence during 2 years of follow-up. Subgroups of responders with unique metabolic and immunological characteristics were identified. Mild to moderate adverse effects were reported, including transient rash, cytopenia, nausea, vomiting, and infections. EXPERT OPINION: Teplizumab marks a turning point in T1D therapy. Areas of future research include the ideal population for screening, cost-effectiveness, and challenges in treatment accessibility. More studies are essential to evaluate the ideal duration of the regimen, the potential benefit of combinations with other drugs, and to identify endophenotypes with a high probability of response."

To obtain a better definition of the role of the Yaa gene in the acceleration of autoimmune disease, we have investigated immune responses to several foreign antigens to determine whether the Yaa gene is able to potentiate immune responses to foreign antigens in a selective manner. We report here that the Yaa gene potentiated immune responses against foreign antigens only in mice which are genetically (H-2-linked) low responding, but not high or non-responding. Moreover, studies on Yaa(+)-Yaa- double bone marrow chimeric mice revealed that B cells from Yaa+ mice were selectively stimulated to produce antibodies to low-responding antigen, human IgG, while both B cell populations similarly responded to high-responding antigen, ovalbumin. Our results suggest that first, the selective immune enhancing activity of the Yaa gene may be related to differences in the capacity of T helper cells specific for given self or foreign antigens; and second, a specific cognate interaction of T helper cells with Yaa+ B cells is apparently responsible for the selective enhancement of immune responses to antigens, to which mice are genetically low responding."

However, the lifetime prevalence of uveal melanoma in the ODM population is not known. This study was designed to determine the lifetime prevalence of uveal melanoma among patients with ocular melanocytosis. DESIGN: Fifty-six white patients manifesting ODM with uveal melanoma formed the basis of the study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Published prevalence rates of ODM and uveal melanoma were used for calculations using Bayes' theorem. RESULTS: The lifetime prevalence of uveal melanoma in white patients with ODM is estimated to be 2.6 x 10(-3). The median age at diagnosis of uveal melanoma in the ODM population was similar to a randomly selected population (60.5 years and 62.5 years, respectively). In the vast majority of patients (90%) with ODM-associated uveal melanoma, the uveal melanoma was diagnosed between the ages of 31 years and 80 years. CONCLUSIONS: One of about 400 patients with ODM followed for life is estimated to develop uveal melanoma. Excessive melanocytes in the uveal tract in ODM may provide the biologic basis for susceptibility to the development of uveal melanoma. Patients with ODM should be monitored ophthalmoscopically, especially during the susceptible period, for the development of uveal melanoma. The authors suggest that a national registry of ODM patients be created and prospective data collected to better assess the risk of developing uveal melanoma."

Uncertainty exists whether such lesions represent a different pathology or simply the precursors of classic dissecting aneurysm. The patient was a 76-year-old woman with intramural hematoma of the ascending aorta. Clinical course, progression of the lesion to type A aortic dissection, and surgical treatment are described. Although natural history of intramural hematoma of the ascending aorta is not clearly elucidated, the case presented confirms that the evolution toward intimal flap formation is possible and that we cannot foresee the stabilization of these lesions. We stress that intramural hematoma of the ascending aorta has to be managed as an aortic type A dissection and that aggressive treatment is advisable."

The RT(50) values for 5-HT were increased by both 10 and 40 mg/kg/day regimens of venlafaxine, whereas those for NE were increased only by the 40 mg/kg/day regimen, indicative of a greater potency of venlafaxine in blocking 5-HT reuptake. The sensitivity of the postsynaptic 5-HT(1A) and alpha(2)-adrenergic receptors was altered by neither regimen of venlafaxine. Using a paradigm by which the 5-HT(1A) antagonist WAY 100635 can induce a disinhibition of firing activity of CA(3) pyramidal neurons, it was demonstrated that the high, but not the low, dose of venlafaxine led to an enhanced tonic activation of postsynaptic 5-HT(1A) receptors in the dorsal hippocampus. The duration of the suppressant effect of the firing activity of CA(3) hippocampus pyramidal neurons produced by the electrical stimulation of the ascending 5-HT pathway was significantly reduced when the frequency of the stimulation was enhanced from 1 Hz to 5 Hz in control rats and in rats treated with 10 mg/kg/day, but not with 40 mg/kg/day of venlafaxine. Hence, venlafaxine induced a desensitization of the terminal 5-HT(1B) autoreceptor only at the high dose. A 2-day treatment with 10 mg/kg/day of venlafaxine induced a suppression of the firing activity of 5-HT neurons of the dorsal raphe. The firing activity of these neurons was back to control level in rats that had been treated for 21 days with the same dose of venlafaxine. The suppressant effect of the i.v. administration of the 5-HT autoreceptor agonist LSD on the firing activity of dorsal raphe 5-HT neurons was reduced in rats that had been treated for 21 days with 10 mg/kg/day of venlafaxine. A 2-day treatment with 40 mg/kg/day of venlafaxine, unlike the 10 mg/kg/day regimen, induced a marked suppression of the firing activity of locus coeruleus NE neurons. However, in contrast to 5-HT neurons, NE neurons did not recover their firing activity after a 21-day treatment. Taken together, the results from this study indicate that the low dose of venlafaxine blocked selectively the reuptake of 5-HT, whereas the high dose blocked the reuptake of both 5-HT and NE. Moreover, an enhancement of serotonergic neurotransmission by venlafaxine was only achieved under conditions whereby the desensitization of the terminal 5-HT(1B) autoreceptor is appended to that of the somatodendritic 5-HT(1A) receptor."

To identify target genes of the pre-MBT dorsalization pathway that might be responsible for head formation in zebrafish, we have cloned zebrafish dickkopf1 (dkk1), which is expressed in tissues implicated in head patterning. We found that dkk1 blocks the post-MBT Wnt signaling and dkk1 is a target of the pre-MBT Wnt signaling. Dkk1 overexpression in the prechordal plate suggests that Dkk1, secreted from the prechordal plate, expands the forebrain at the expense of the midbrain in the anterior neural plate. Furthermore, dkk1 acts in parallel to the homeobox gene bozozok and bozozok is required for the maintenance of dkk1 expression. The nodal gene squint is also required for the maintenance of dkk1 expression. Among the mutually dependent target genes of the pre-MBT Wnt signaling, dkk1 plays an important role in patterning the anterior head of zebrafish."

These estimates are mainly computed on the basis of sequence comparison and membrane protein prediction. It is therefore urgent to develop methods capable of selecting membrane proteins especially in the case of outer membrane proteins, barely taken into consideration when proteome wide analysis is performed. This will also help protein annotation when no homologous sequence is found in the database. Outer membrane proteins solved so far at atomic resolution interact with the external membrane of bacteria with a characteristic beta barrel structure comprising different even numbers of beta strands (beta barrel membrane proteins). In this they differ from the membrane proteins of the cytoplasmic membrane endowed with alpha helix bundles (all alpha membrane proteins) and need specialised predictors. RESULTS: We develop a HMM model, which can predict the topology of beta barrel membrane proteins using, as input, evolutionary information. The model is cyclic with 6 types of states: two for the beta strand transmembrane core, one for the beta strand cap on either side of the membrane, one for the inner loop, one for the outer loop and one for the globular domain state in the middle of each loop. The development of a specific input for HMM based on multiple sequence alignment is novel. The accuracy per residue of the model is 83% when a jack knife procedure is adopted. With a model optimisation method using a dynamic programming algorithm seven topological models out of the twelve proteins included in the testing set are also correctly predicted. When used as a discriminator, the model is rather selective. At a fixed probability value, it retains 84% of a non-redundant set comprising 145 sequences of well-annotated outer membrane proteins. Concomitantly, it correctly rejects 90% of a set of globular proteins including about 1200 chains with low sequence identity (<30%) and 90% of a set of all alpha membrane proteins, including 188 chains."

Extensive research over the last 50 years has indicated this polyphenol can both prevent and treat cancer. The anticancer potential of curcumin stems from its ability to suppress proliferation of a wide variety of tumor cells, down-regulate transcription factors NF-kappa B, AP-1 and Egr-1; down-regulate the expression of COX2, LOX, NOS, MMP-9, uPA, TNF, chemokines, cell surface adhesion molecules and cyclin D1; down-regulate growth factor receptors (such as EGFR and HER2); and inhibit the activity of c-Jun N-terminal kinase, protein tyrosine kinases and protein serine/threonine kinases. In several systems, curcumin has been described as a potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent. Evidence has also been presented to suggest that curcumin can suppress tumor initiation, promotion and metastasis. Pharmacologically, curcumin has been found to be safe. Human clinical trials indicated no dose-limiting toxicity when administered at doses up to 10 g/day. All of these studies suggest that curcumin has enormous potential in the prevention and therapy of cancer. The current review describes in detail the data supporting these studies."

Local production of PTHrP by metastatic tumor cells in bone has been linked to bone destruction and tumor growth. Ameloblastoma (AB) is a relatively common odontogenic epithelial neoplasm that manifests local infiltrative intraosseous growth. AB recapitulates the developing enamel epithelium, in which PTHrP recently has been demonstrated. Yet PTHrP expression in a series of ABs has not been studied to date. The purpose of this investigation is to assess the expression of PTHrP in ameloblastoma. STUDY DESIGN: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections of ameloblastoma (n = 30; 24 conventional, 4 unicystic, and 2 arising in dentigerous cyst) were immunostained with anti-PTHrP antibody using a multistep streptavidin-peroxidase technique. Semiquantitative scoring of immunoreactivity was assessed as mild, moderate, and intense. RESULTS: All cases (100%) demonstrated positive immunoreactivity, with mild reaction in 3 conventional ABs, 1 unicystic and 1 AB arising in dentigerous cyst, and with moderate reaction in 12 conventional ABs, 3 unicystic and 1 AB arising in dentigerous cyst. Intense immunoreactivity was seen in 9 cases of conventional AB. This difference in immunostaining was not statistically significant (Sigma2 = 4.41, df = 4, P = .358). CONCLUSION: The results of this investigation suggest that PTHrP may play a significant role in local bone resorption, offering at least partial explanation for the tumor's infiltrative growth and destructive behavior. The uniformity of PTHrP expression by AB, as detailed in this study, may harbor significant therapeutic implications, particularly through PTHrP-blocking treatment modalities."

METHODS: Cultured human keratocytes were exposed to various concentrations of ofloxacin or netilmicin (0.16-5.0 mg/mL). Both cell proliferation (MTT assay) and cell morphology (phase-contrast microscopy) were evaluated after 1, 4, 12, and 24 hours of incubation. Measurement of annexin V binding performed in association with the dye exclusion test using propidium iodide (PI) was also performed by FACS analysis after 4 hours of exposure. RESULTS: Both antimicrobials induced dose- and time-dependent morphologic changes in keratocytes, yet the effects of netilmicin were minimal. After 24 hours of exposure, both drugs induced a dose-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation; however, ofloxacin demonstrated significantly more toxic effects than netilmicin (t test for ED50 values, P < 0.0001). Statistical differences between 2 antibiotics start at concentrations above 1.25 mg/mL (ANOVA with post-hoc test, P < 0.01). Expression of the apoptotic marker annexin V was unaffected by antibiotic exposure, whereas the uptake of the necrotic marker PI was increased by ofloxacin (5 mg/mL) but not by netilmicin (ofloxacin versus netilmicin, ANOVA, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Relative effects of aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones on stromal keratocytes appear to be different: netilmicin was shown to be significantly less toxic than ofloxacin. This finding is particularly relevant in deciding the optimal antibiotic to be applied in clinical situations in which the epithelium is absent or compromised, as after photorefractive keratectomy, alkali burns, or ulcerative keratitis."

Here, we show, using a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis, that similar amounts of Pol II associate with Pol II promoter DNAs in influenza virus-infected and mock-infected cells. However, there is a statistically significant reduction in Pol II densities in the coding region of Pol II genes in infected cells.

Since then, the association of these conditions has been questioned. We tested the hypothesis that these conditions are associated, and, based on recent research, propose a common etiology. METHODS: Data from the U.S. Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) 16 Data Warehouse were analyzed. Chi-square tests and calculated odds ratios (ORs) were utilized to describe the magnitude of association, and multivariable logistic regression models were used to determine the variables associated with Saint's triad. RESULTS: Among 637,518 patient records (1996-2005), any hernia was diagnosed among 22,181 (3.5%) patients, hiatus hernia among 1,661 (0.3%), diverticulosis of the colon among 14,375 (2.3%), and gallbladder disease among 5,284 (0.8%). The following associations were observed: diverticulosis, hiatus hernia (OR: 6.9), hiatus hernia, gallbladder disease (OR = 3.8), and gallbladder disease, diverticulosis (OR = 5.9). Patients with both diverticulosis and gallbladder disease were more likely to have hiatus hernia (OR = 3.8; P = 0.0012) or any hernia (OR = 10.7; P < 0.0001). Diseases associated with Saint's triad (incorporating any hernia) included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR = 4.3), hypertension (OR = 3.1), aortic aneurysm (OR = 2.2), and diabetes (OR = 1.8). CONCLUSIONS: Herniosis, the systemic connective tissue disease known to cause diverticulosis and herniae, may be responsible for Saint's triad. Diabetes, like aging, enhanced herniosis.

Recent cross-linking studies have suggested that PLB binding and Ca(2+) binding to SERCA2a are mutually exclusive. PLB binds to the E2 conformation of the Ca(2+)-ATPase, preventing formation of E1, the conformation that binds two Ca(2+) (at sites I and II) with high affinity and is required for ATP hydrolysis. Here we determined whether Ca(2+) binding to site I, site II, or both sites is sufficient to dissociate PLB from the Ca(2+) pump. Seven SERCA2a mutants with amino acid substitutions at Ca(2+)-binding site I (E770Q, T798A, and E907Q), site II (E309Q and N795A), or both sites (D799N and E309Q/E770Q) were made, and the effects of Ca(2+) on N30C-PLB cross-linking to Lys(328) of SERCA2a were measured. In agreement with earlier reports with the skeletal muscle Ca(2+)-ATPase, none of the SERCA2a mutants (except E907Q) hydrolyzed ATP in the presence of Ca(2+); however, all were phosphorylatable by P(i) to form E2P. Ca(2+) inhibition of E2P formation was observed only in SERCA2a mutants retaining site I. In cross-linking assays, strong cross-linking between N30C-PLB and each Ca(2+)-ATPase mutant was observed in the absence of Ca(2+). Importantly, however, micromolar Ca(2+) inhibited PLB cross-linking only to mutants retaining a functional Ca(2+)-binding site I. The dynamic equilibrium between Ca(2+) pumps and N30C-PLB was retained by all mutants, demonstrating normal regulation of cross-linking by ATP, thapsigargin, and anti-PLB antibody. From these results we conclude that site I is the key Ca(2+)-binding site regulating the physical association between PLB and SERCA2a."

Mutations in the gene encoding ribosomal protein S19 (RPS19) have been identified in approximately 25% of DBA families. Most of these mutations disrupt either the translation or stability of the RPS19 protein and are predicted to cause DBA by haploinsufficiency. However, approximately 30% of RPS19 mutations are missense mutations that do not alter the stability of the RPS19 protein and are hypothesized to act by a dominant negative mechanism. To formally test this hypothesis, we generated a transgenic mouse model expressing an RPS19 mutation in which an arginine residue is replaced with a tryptophan residue at codon 62 (RPS19R62W). Constitutive expression of RPS19R62W in developing mice was lethal. Conditional expression of RPS19R62W resulted in growth retardation, a mild anemia with reduced numbers of erythroid progenitors, and significant inhibition of terminal erythroid maturation, similar to DBA. RNA profiling demonstrated more than 700 dysregulated genes belonging to the same pathways that are disrupted in RNA profiles of DBA patient cells. We conclude that RPS19R62W is a dominant negative DBA mutation."

ADAM17 can be activated by stimulation of several tyrosine kinase receptors, raising questions about whether oncogenic tyrosine kinases could also enhance EGFR signaling and activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) via stimulation of ADAM17. The main goal of this study was to evaluate the role of Src in activating ADAM17. We provide evidence that a constitutively active transforming form of Src, the E378G mutant, as well as v-Src enhance ADAM17-mediated shedding of the EGFR ligand TGFalpha. Moreover, we demonstrate that constitutive shedding of TGFalpha can be reduced by inhibition of Src in several cell lines, including COS7, MCF7 (the human breast cancer cell line), PAE (a pig aortic endothelial cell line) and HaCaT (the human keratinocyte cell line) cells. Src(E378G)-stimulated shedding of TGFalpha is abolished in Adam17(-/-) cells, but can be rescued by wild-type (wt) ADAM17 and a mutant ADAM17 lacking its cytoplasmic domain. These findings demonstrate that ADAM17 is the principal TGFalpha sheddase that is activated by Src in a manner that does not require the cytoplasmic domain of ADAM17. Finally, we show that stimulation of ADAM17 by Src(E378G) leads to enhanced paracrine signaling via release of EGFR ligands into the culture supernatant. These results raise the possibility that activation of ADAM17 by oncogenic forms of Src can aid in promoting tumorigenesis by enhancing signaling via the EGFR and ERK in an autocrine and paracrine manner. Enhanced autocrine signaling could further activate tumor cells expressing oncogenic mutants of Src, whereas paracrine signaling could stimulate EGFR and ERK signaling in surrounding non-transformed cells such as stromal cells, thereby contributing to crosstalk between tumor cells and stromal cells."

CPVT-associated RyR2 mutations cause fatal ventricular arrhythmias in young individuals during beta-adrenergic stimulation. OBJECTIVE: This study sought to determine the effects of a novel RyR2-G230C mutation and whether this mutation and RyR2-P2328S alter the sensitivity of the channel to luminal calcium (Ca(2+)). METHODS AND RESULTS: Functional characterizations of recombinant human RyR2-G230C channels were performed under conditions mimicking stress. Human RyR2 mutant channels were generated by site-directed mutagenesis and heterologously expressed in HEK293 cells together with calstabin2. RyR2 channels were measured to examine the regulation of the channels by cytosolic versus luminal sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+). A 50-year-old white man with repeated syncopal episodes after exercise had a cardiac arrest and harbored the mutation RyR2-G230C. cAMP-dependent protein kinase-phosphorylated RyR2-G230C channels exhibited a significantly higher open probability at diastolic Ca(2+) concentrations, associated with a depletion of calstabin2. The luminal Ca(2+) sensitivities of RyR2-G230C and RyR2-P2328S channels were WT-like. CONCLUSIONS: The RyR2-G230C mutant exhibits similar biophysical defects compared with previously characterized CPVT mutations: decreased binding of the stabilizing subunit calstabin2 and a leftward shift in the Ca(2+) dependence for activation under conditions that simulate exercise, consistent with a \"leaky\" channel. Both RyR2-G230C and RyR2-P2328S channels exhibit normal luminal Ca(2+) activation. Thus, diastolic sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) leak caused by reduced calstabin2 binding and a leftward shift in the Ca(2+) dependence for activation by diastolic levels of cytosolic Ca(2+) is a common mechanism underlying CPVT."

METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed using the Irish Health Services Executive Primary Care Reimbursement Services national pharmacy claims database. Individuals who received any medicines were identified from January 2001 to January 2009 (n = 1 235 671). Patients newly treated with statins from 1 January 2002 to 31 December 2007 were identified (n = 239 628).

Adjusted hazards ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated to examine the association between statins (any vs. none) and time to new onset treated diabetes using Cox proportional hazard regression. The dose and duration response relationship between statins and new onset treated diabetes was examined using restricted spline functions to assess the linearity of the relationship.

CONCLUSION: An increased risk of new onset treated diabetes was found in those treated with statins showing significant duration and dose effect. Further study is required to confirm this association."

The disease encompasses a spectrum of clinical phenotypes that have been correlated with molecular subtypes that are characterized by the molecular mass of the protease-resistant fragment of the disease-related conformation of the prion protein and a polymorphism at codon 129 of the gene encoding the prion protein. A cell-free assay of prion protein misfolding was used to investigate the ability of these sporadic CJD molecular subtypes to propagate using brain-derived sources of the cellular prion protein (PrP(C)). This study confirmed the presence of three distinct sporadic CJD molecular subtypes with PrP(C) substrate requirements that reflected their codon 129 associations in vivo. However, the ability of a sporadic CJD molecular subtype to use a specific PrP(C) substrate was not determined solely by codon 129 as the efficiency of prion propagation was also influenced by the composition of the brain tissue from which the PrP(C) substrate was sourced, thus indicating that nuances in PrP(C) or additional factors may determine sporadic CJD subtype. The results of this study will aid in the design of diagnostic assays that can detect prion disease across the diversity of sporadic CJD subtypes."

The proteins of these genes interact physically and work in concert during B-cell signaling. Little is know about their interactions with other B-cell signaling molecules or their role in the process. Using yeast two hybrid (Y2H) we sought for factors that interact with BANK1. We found that the molecular switch PLCg2 interacts with BANK1 and that the interaction is promoted by B-cell receptor (BCR) stimulation. We found further that the kinase activity of BLK enhanced BANK1- PLCg2 binding and that the interaction was suppressed upon BLK depletion. Immunoprecipitation and mutational analysis demonstrated that the interaction between BANK1 and PLCg2 was dependent on specific tyrosine and proline residues on the adaptor protein. Our results provide new information important to understand the role of these two genes in basic B-cell physiology and immune-related diseases."

Extreme PPROM occurs before 26 weeks' gestation and can result in perinatal morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to study the perinatal outcomes of mothers with extreme PPROM. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of 44 consecutive pregnant women, presenting with PPROM before 26 weeks' gestation, was conducted from January 2006 to December 2011 at Sultan Qaboos University Hospital, Oman. Maternal and neonatal information was collected from medical records, and delivery and neonatal unit registries. Women with PPROM presenting after 26 weeks' gestation, those with multiple gestations, or other types of preterm deliveries were excluded from the study. RESULTS: Of the 44 preterm infants admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, 24 (55%) survived, 7 (16%) died within 24 hours of birth, 9 (20%) were miscarried, and 4 (9%) were stillbirths. Neonatal sepsis and pulmonary hypoplasia were the major causes of death. Neonatal complications among the surviving infants included prematurity in 11 (46%), respiratory distress syndrome in 19 (79%), sepsis in 12 (50%), and low birth weight in 11 (46%). The neonatal survival rate was significantly associated with the gestational age at delivery but not with the gestational age upon rupture of membranes. CONCLUSION: Extreme PPROM was associated with adverse perinatal outcomes. The results of this study will help obstetricians and neonatologists in counselling couples experiencing PPROM. Future studies of long-term neonatal morbidity should have larger sample sizes and include more hospitals."

We assessed the ability of both to predict major bleeding (MB) in patients with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTE-ACS), compared to other renal function parameters and clinical risk scores. METHODS AND RESULTS: We included 273 patients. Blood samples were obtained within 24h of admission. The endpoint was MB. During a follow-up of 760 days (411-1,098 days), 25 patients (9.2%) had MB. Patients with MB had higher concentrations of BTP (0.98 mg/L; 0.71-1.16 mg/L vs. 0.72 mg/L, 0.60-0.91 mg/L, P=0.002), CysC (1.05 mg/L; 0.91-1.30 mg/L vs. 0.90 mg/L, 0.75-1.08 mg/L, P=0.003), higher CRUSADE score (39 +- 16 points vs. 29 +- 15 points, P=0.002) and lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR; 66 +- 27 vs. 80 +- 30 ml min(-1) 1.73 m(-2), P=0.02) than patients without MB; there was no difference in creatinine level between the groups (P=0.14). After multivariable adjustment, both were predictors of MB, while eGFR and creatinine did not achieve statistical significance. Among subjects with eGFR >60 ml min(-1) 1.73 m(-2), those with elevated concentrations of both biomarkers had a significantly higher risk for MB. Net reclassification indexes from the addition of BTP and CysC to CRUSADE risk score were 38% and 21% respectively, while the relative integrated discrimination indexes were 12.5% and 3.8%. CONCLUSIONS: Among NSTE-ACS patients, BTP and CysC were superior to conventional renal parameters for predicting MB, and improved clinical stratification for hemorrhagic risk."

There are many studies evaluating thyroid function in acute and critical conditions. Information on thyroid dysfunction in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is limited; its correlation with short and long-term outcome is not fully known. METHODS: Four hundred and fifty seven patients diagnosed with STEMI in our emergency department were included in the study. Patients were divided into two groups: patients with normal thyroid function (euthyroid) and patients with thyroid dysfunction. STEMI was diagnosed with 12 derivation surface electrocardiogram. Thyroid hormone levels (TSH, free T3 and free T4) were measured. Patients with other acute coronary syndromes and endocrine pathologies except diabetes mellitus were excluded. Two patient groups were compared in terms of in-hospital and long-term outcome. RESULTS: Out of 457, 72 (15%) patients with thyroid dysfunction were detected. The other patients were euthyroid and constituted the control group. In-hospital cardiogenic shock (15% vs. 3% in the control group; p < 0.01) and death (7% vs. 1% in the control group; p < 0.01) were more frequently observed in the thyroid dysfunction group. In the subgroup analysis, it was observed that patients with sick euthyroid syndrome have the poorest outcome. Other markers for poor outcome were anemia and renal failure. CONCLUSIONS: Thyroid dysfunction, particularly sick euthyroid syndrome, was found to be related to in-hospital and long term mortality in patients with STEMI undergoing primary percutaneous intervention."

On the LCV, AnkB triggers docking of K(48)-linked polyubiquitinated proteins that are degraded by the host proteasomes to elevate cellular levels of amino acids needed for intracellular proliferation. Interference with AnkB function triggers L. pneumophila to exhibit a starvation response and differentiate into the nonreplicative phase in response to the basal levels of cellular amino acids that are not sufficient to power intracellular proliferation of L. pneumophila. Therefore, we have determined whether the biological function of AnkB is temporally and spatially triggered upon bacterial attachment to the host cell to circumvent a counterproductive bacterial differentiation into the nonreplicative phase upon bacterial entry. Here, we show that upon attachment of L. pneumophila to human monocyte-derived macrophages (hMDMs), the host farnesylation and ubiquitination machineries are recruited by the Dot/Icm system to the plasma membrane exclusively beneath sites of bacterial attachment. Transcription and injection of ankB is triggered by attached extracellular bacteria followed by rapid farnesylation and anchoring of AnkB to the cytosolic side of the plasma membrane beneath bacterial attachment, where K(48)-linked polyubiquitinated proteins are assembled and degraded by the proteasomes, leading to a rapid rise in the cellular levels of amino acids. Our data represent a novel strategy by an intracellular pathogen that triggers rapid nutritional remodeling of the host cell upon attachment to the plasma membrane, and as a result, a gratuitous surplus of cellular amino acids is generated to support proliferation of the incoming pathogen.

The B-cell receptor signaling pathway is being actively explored as a therapeutic target in CLL. Ibrutinib, an inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase is showing impressive responses in heavily pre-treated high-risk CLL, whether alone or in combination with MoAbs or chemotherapy. Other key components of the BCR pathway, namely PI3K-delta, are also being targeted with novel therapies with promising results as well. Future trials would likely evaluate ibrutinib in the front-line setting. Moreover, improvements in allogeneic HCT mostly by continuing to reduce associated toxicity as well as incorporating cellular therapies such as autologous CLL tumor vaccines, among others, will continue to expand. This is also the case for the next generation of chimeric antigen receptor therapy for CLL once genetically modified T cells are available at broad scale and with improved efficacy. As our ability to further refine and integrate these therapies continues to improve, and we gain further knowledge from gene sequencing, we anticipate that treatment algorithms will continue to be revised to a more personalized approach to treat this disease with improved efficacy and devoid of unnecessary toxicity.

DESIGN: a cross-sectional analysis of a healthy subset from the Good Aging in Skane-cohort study representative of the Swedish general population. SUBJECTS: 1252 participants without vascular disease and diabetes (43.9% men) of whom 203 were over 80 years old were included from the original cohort of 2931. METHODS: plasma cystatin C and plasma creatinine were used as markers for GFR. Estimated GFR (eGFR) was calculated with three chronic kidney disease epidemiology collaboration (CKD-EPI) formulas involving cystatin C, creatinine or both. RESULTS: the median for plasma cystatin C was 0.93 mg/l (60-69 years old), 1.04 (70-79 years old) and 1.24 (80+ years old). The difference in mg/l between the 5th and 95th percentile was 0.46, 0.62 and 0.90 for these age groups. Male sex increased the age effect on plasma cystatin C levels with 0.004 mg/l/year (P = 0.03), adjusted for vascular risk factors. Smoking, lower HDL and higher diastolic blood pressure were associated with higher cystatin C levels. 54.7% (CKD-EPI creatinine) to 73.9% (CKD-EPI cystatin C) of the 80+ had an eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2. CONCLUSION: non-diabetics without overt vascular disease exhibit an age related but heterogeneous decline in renal function. The ageing effect is more pronounced in men. At least half of healthy 80+ years old could be expected to have at least CKD Stage 3 with eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2."

PCR-RFLP/AFLP, bisulfite-sequencing and real-time PCR approaches were used for genetic, epigenetic and expression analysis respectively. SLE cases exhibited elevated plasma homocysteine levels compared to healthy controls (24.93 +- 1.3 vs. 11.67 +- 0.48 mumol/l), while plasma folate levels showed no association (7.10 +- 2.49 vs. 7.64 +- 2.09 ng/ml). The RFC1 80G>A polymorphism showed 1.32-fold risk (95% CI: 1.02-1.72) for SLE, while glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCPII) 1561C>T showed reduced risk (OR: 0.47, 95% CI: 0.24-0.90). The expression of RFC1 (0.37 +- 0.09 vs. 0.60 +- 0.17) and HLA-DR (0.68 +- 0.17 vs. 0.98 +- 0.02) was down regulated in the SLE cases. The hypermethylation of RFC1 as observed in the current study may contribute for its down regulation. Plasma folate and thymidylate synthase (TYMS) 5'-UTR 28 bp tandem repeat showed an inverse association with methylation of RFC1 and MHC2TA. SLE cases with hypocomplementemia showed hypermethylation of RFC1, hypomethylation/up regulation of MHC2TA and down regulation of HLA-DR. The hypermethylation of MHC2TA and down regulation of RFC1, MHC2TA and HLA-DR were observed in anti-cardiolipin antibody positive SLE cases. The up regulation of RFC1 and HLA-DR was observed in anti-dsDNA antibody positive SLE cases. The hypomethylation/upregulation of RFC1 and MHC2TA was observed in anti-RNP antibody positive cases. To conclude, one-carbon genetic variants influence epigenetic of MHC2TA and RFC1, thus contributing to phenotypic heterogeneity of SLE."

        "text": "Somatostatin and diabetic retinopathy: current concepts and new therapeutic perspectives.\nSomatostatin (SST) is abundantly produced by the human retina, and the main source is the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). SST exerts relevant functions in the retina (neuromodulation, angiostatic, and anti-permeability actions) by interacting with SST receptors (SSTR) that are also expressed in the retina. In the diabetic retina, a downregulation of SST production does exist. In this article, we give an overview of the mechanisms by which this deficit of SST participates in the main pathogenic mechanisms involved in diabetic retinopathy (DR): neurodegeneration, neovascularization, and vascular leakage. In view of the relevant SST functions in the retina and the reduction of SST production in the diabetic eye, SST replacement has been proposed as a new target for treatment of DR. This could be implemented by intravitreous injections of SST analogs or gene therapy, but this is an aggressive route for the early stages of DR. Since topical administration of SST has been effective in preventing retinal neurodegeneration in STZ-induced diabetic rats, it seems reasonable to test this new approach in humans. In this regard, the results of the ongoing clinical trial EUROCONDOR will provide useful information. In conclusion, SST is a natural neuroprotective and antiangiogenic factor synthesized by the retina which is downregulated in the diabetic eye and, therefore, its replacement seems a rational approach for treating DR. However, clinical trials will be needed to establish the exact position of targeting SST in the treatment of this disabling complication of diabetes."

Recent studies indicated that high levels of DCP are associated with the malignant potential of HCC. In this study, we aimed to investigate the association of DCP with gefitinib treatment failure in HCC and whether DCP counteracts gefitinib-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis of HCC. METHODS: The experiments were performed in HCC cell lines HepG2 and PLC/PRF/5. The effects of gefitinib on HCC in the presence or absence of DCP were evaluated by the 3-[4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2, 5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Apoptotic cells were identified by Annexin V-FITC/PI staining. Western blotting was performed to analyze the expressions of molecules related to the apoptotic caspase-dependent pathway and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway. RESULTS: Gefitinib inhibited HCC cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in HCC cells. The effects of gefitinib on HCC cells were antagonized by DCP. In the presence of DCP, HCC cells were resistant to the gefitinib-induced inhibition of proliferation and stimulation of apoptosis. DCP prevented the activation of the apoptotic caspase-dependent pathway induced by gefitinib. These antagonistic effects of DCP also arose from its ability to up-regulate EGFR, c-Met and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) in HCC cells. CONCLUSION: DCP antagonized gefitinib-induced HCC cell growth inhibition by counteracting apoptosis and up-regulating the EGFR pathway. High levels of DCP might thus lead to low response rates or possibly no response to gefitinib in patients with HCC."

Bacterial-induced host proteins such as procalcitonin, C-reactive protein (CRP), and Interleukin-6, are routinely used to support diagnosis of infection. However, their performance is negatively affected by inter-patient variability, including time from symptom onset, clinical syndrome, and pathogens. Our aim was to identify novel viral-induced host proteins that can complement bacterial-induced proteins to increase diagnostic accuracy. Initially, we conducted a bioinformatic screen to identify putative circulating host immune response proteins. The resulting 600 candidates were then quantitatively screened for diagnostic potential using blood samples from 1002 prospectively recruited patients with suspected acute infectious disease and controls with no apparent infection. For each patient, three independent physicians assigned a diagnosis based on comprehensive clinical and laboratory investigation including PCR for 21 pathogens yielding 319 bacterial, 334 viral, 112 control and 98 indeterminate diagnoses; 139 patients were excluded based on predetermined criteria. The best performing host-protein was TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) (area under the curve [AUC] of 0.89; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.86 to 0.91), which was consistently up-regulated in viral infected patients. We further developed a multi-protein signature using logistic-regression on half of the patients and validated it on the remaining half. The signature with the highest precision included both viral- and bacterial-induced proteins: TRAIL, Interferon gamma-induced protein-10, and CRP (AUC of 0.94; 95% CI, 0.92 to 0.96). The signature was superior to any of the individual proteins (P<0.001), as well as routinely used clinical parameters and their combinations (P<0.001). It remained robust across different physiological systems, times from symptom onset, and pathogens (AUCs 0.87-1.0). The accurate differential diagnosis provided by this novel combination of viral- and bacterial-induced proteins has the potential to improve management of patients with acute infections and reduce antibiotic misuse.

Curcumin, obtained from the rhizome of Curcuma longa, has potent anticancer activity. To date, no study has examined the interaction of PhIP with curcumin in breast epithelial cells. The present study demonstrates the mechanisms by which curcumin inhibits PhIP-induced cytotoxicity in normal breast epithelial cells (MCF-10A). Curcumin significantly inhibited PhIP-induced DNA adduct formation and DNA double stand breaks with a concomitant decrease in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. The expression of Nrf2, FOXO targets; DNA repair genes BRCA-1, H2AFX and PARP-1; and tumor suppressor P16 was studied to evaluate the influence on these core signaling pathways. PhIP induced the expression of various antioxidant and DNA repair genes. However, co-treatment with curcumin inhibited this expression. PhIP suppressed the expression of the tumor suppressor P16 gene, whereas curcumin co-treatment increased its expression. Caspase-3 and -9 were slightly suppressed by curcumin with a consequent inhibition of cell death. These results suggest that curcumin appears to be an effective anti-PhIP food additive likely acting through multiple molecular targets. "

Synaptic pathology may be studied by examining protein biomarkers specific for different synaptic elements. We recently showed that the dendritic protein neurogranin (Ng), including the endogenous Ng peptide 48 to 76 (Ng48-76), is markedly increased in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in AD and that Ng48-76 is the dominant peptide in human brain tissue. The aim of this study was to characterize Ng in plasma and CSF using mass spectrometry and to investigate the performance of plasma Ng as an AD biomarker. METHODS: Paired plasma and CSF samples from patients with AD (n = 25) and healthy controls (n = 20) were analyzed in parallel using an immunoassay developed in-house on the Meso Scale Discovery platform and hybrid immunoaffinity-mass spectrometry (HI-MS). A second plasma material from patients with AD (n = 13) and healthy controls (n = 17) was also analyzed with HI-MS. High-resolution mass spectrometry was used for identification of endogenous plasma Ng peptides. RESULTS: Ng in human plasma is present as several endogenous peptides. Of the 16 endogenous Ng peptides identified, seven were unique for plasma and not detectable in CSF. However, Ng48-76 was not present in plasma. CSF Ng was significantly increased in AD compared with controls (P < 0.0001), whereas the plasma Ng levels were similar between the groups in both studies. Plasma and CSF Ng levels showed no correlation. CSF Ng was stable during storage at -20 C for up to 2 days, and no de novo generation of peptides were detected. CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, to our knowledge, we have identified several endogenous Ng peptides in human plasma. In agreement with previous studies, we show that CSF Ng is significantly increased in AD as compared with healthy controls. The origin of Ng in plasma and its possible use as a biomarker need to be further investigated. The results suggest that CSF Ng, in particular Ng48-76, might reflect the neurodegenerative processes within the brain, indicating a role for Ng as a potential novel clinical biomarker for synaptic function in AD."

One exemplar gene is HUWE1, which has been found to be mutated in numerous studies. However, due to the large size of this gene and a lack of functional analysis of identified mutations, their significance to carcinogenesis is unclear. To determine the importance of HUWE1, we chose to examine its function in colorectal cancer, where it is mutated in up to 15 per cent of tumours. Modelling of identified mutations showed that they inactivate the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of HUWE1. Genetic deletion of Huwe1 rapidly accelerated tumourigenic in mice carrying loss of the intestinal tumour suppressor gene Apc, with a dramatic increase in tumour initiation. Mechanistically, this phenotype was driven by increased MYC and rapid DNA damage accumulation leading to loss of the second copy of Apc The increased levels of DNA damage sensitised Huwe1-deficient tumours to DNA-damaging agents and to deletion of the anti-apoptotic protein MCL1. Taken together, these data identify HUWE1 as a bona fide tumour suppressor gene in the intestinal epithelium and suggest a potential vulnerability of HUWE1-mutated tumours to DNA-damaging agents and inhibitors of anti-apoptotic proteins."

Approximately 10% of MS patients experience chronic progression from disease onset, termed primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS). Although several disease-modifying treatment (DMT) options exist for relapsing forms of this disease, DMT options are few for progressive MS (PPMS and SPMS). Herein, we strive to define progressive MS, review major clinical trials aimed at progressive MS, and delineate potential strategies in the management of progressive MS. RECENT FINDINGS: In 2017, the first DMT for PPMS, the B lymphocyte-depleting monoclonal antibody, ocrelizumab, came to market. Ocrelizumab reduced 12-week confirmed disability progression (CDP) by 24% versus placebo. Siponimod, a selective sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulator, reduced 3-month CDP by 21% versus placebo in SPMS. Ibudilast slowed brain atrophy in PPMS and SPMS patients in a multicenter phase 2b study. Smaller early phase studies of alpha-lipoic acid and simvastatin each found slowing of rate of whole brain atrophy in SPMS patients. Reasons now exist for optimism in the search for DMTs for progressive MS. It remains a challenge to identify outcome measures that accurately reflect the underlying pathology in progressive MS, which is less inflammatory and more degenerative than RRMS."

A role for monoaminergic systems in treating these conditions is highlighted by the clinical use of US Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs that act on these systems, such as dextroamphetamine, methylphenidate, modafinil, and armodafinil. Solriamfetol (JZP-110) is a wake-promoting agent that is currently being evaluated to treat ES in patients with narcolepsy or OSA. Clinical and preclinical data suggest that the wake-promoting effects of solriamfetol differ from medications such as modafinil and amphetamine. The goal of the current studies was to characterize the mechanism of action of solriamfetol at monoamine transporters using in vitro and in vivo assays. Results indicate that solriamfetol has dual reuptake inhibition activity at dopamine (DA; IC50 = 2.9 muM) and norepinephrine (NE; IC50 = 4.4 muM) transporters, and this activity is associated in vivo with increased extracellular concentration of DA and NE as measured by microdialysis. Solriamfetol has negligible functional activity at the serotonin transporter (IC50 > 100 muM). Moreover, the wake-promoting effects of solriamfetol are probably owing to activity at DA and NE transporters rather than other neurotransmitter systems, such as histamine or orexin. The dual activity of solriamfetol at DA and NE transporters and the lack of significant monoamine-releasing properties of solriamfetol might explain the differences in the in vivo effects of solriamfetol compared with modafinil or amphetamine. Taken together, these data suggest that solriamfetol may offer an important advancement in the treatment of ES in patients with narcolepsy or OSA."

Thalidomide was first developed as a sedative in 1950s, but it was withdrawn from the market because of teratogenicity. In 1990s, however, thalidomide received attention due to the discovery of its anticancer potential derived from antiangiogenic and immunomodulatory activities, and its therapeutic effect on myeloma. In 2006, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the use of thalidomide under strict control for the treatment of multiple myeloma. After that, two new IMiDs, lenalidomide and pomalidomide, were developed for the sake of more antitumor activity and less adverse events than thalidomide. The molecular mechanism of action of IMiDs remained unclear for a long time until 2010 when the protein cereblon (CRBN) was identified as a primary direct target. IMiDs binds to CRBN and alters the substrate specificity of the CRBN E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, resulting in breakdown of intrinsic downstream proteins such as IKZF1 (Ikaros) and IKZF3 (Aiolos). There are many clinical trials of multiple myeloma using IMiDs under various conditions, and most of them show the efficacy of IMiDs. Nowadays lenalidomide plays a central role in both newly diagnosed and relapsed/refractory settings, mainly in combination with other novel agents such as proteasome inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies. This review presents an overview of recent advances in immunomodulatory drugs in the treatment of multiple myeloma."

METHODS: Part 1 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week dose titration of once-weekly golodirsen; part 2 is an ongoing, open-label evaluation. Safety and pharmacokinetics were primary and secondary objectives of part 1. Primary biological outcome measures of part 2 were blinded exon skipping and dystrophin protein production on muscle biopsies (baseline, week 48) evaluated, respectively, using reverse transcription PCR and Western blot and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Twelve patients were randomized to receive golodirsen (n = 8) or placebo (n = 4) in part 1. All from part 1 plus 13 additional patients received 30 mg/kg golodirsen in part 2. Safety findings were consistent with those previously observed in pediatric patients with DMD. Most of the study drug was excreted within 4 hours following administration. A significant increase in exon 53 skipping was associated with ~16-fold increase over baseline in dystrophin protein expression at week 48, with a mean percent normal dystrophin protein standard of 1.019% (range, 0.09%-4.30%). Sarcolemmal localization of dystrophin was demonstrated by significantly increased dystrophin-positive fibers (week 48, p < 0.001) and a positive correlation (Spearman r = 0.663; p < 0.001) with dystrophin protein change from baseline, measured by Western blot and immunohistochemistry. CONCLUSION: Golodirsen was well-tolerated; muscle biopsies from golodirsen-treated patients showed increased exon 53 skipping, dystrophin production, and correct dystrophin sarcolemmal localization. CLINICALTRIALSGOV IDENTIFIER: NCT02310906. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class I evidence that golodirsen is safe and Class IV evidence that it induces exon skipping and novel dystrophin as confirmed by 3 different assays."

The co-chaperone FK506-binding protein 51 (FKBP51) is a regulator of the stress system and is associated with a risk to develop stress-related mental illnesses. PURPOSE: To assess the effect of a general FKBP51 knockout on brain structure and connectivity in male mice. STUDY TYPE: Animal study. ANIMAL MODEL: Two cohorts of FKBP51 knockout (51KO) and wildtype (WT) mice. The first cohort was comprised of n = 18 WT and n = 17 51KOs; second cohort n = 10 WT and n = 9 51KOs. FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: 9.4T/3D gradient echo (VBM), DTI-EPI (DTI). ASSESSMENT: Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). For VBM, all procedures were executed in SPM12. DTI: FMRIB Software Library (FSL) Tract Based Statistics (TBSS) were integrated within DTI-TK, allowing the creation of a mean FA skeleton. A voxelwise statistical analysis was applied between WT and 51KO mice. STATISTICAL TEST: Volumetric differences were collected at a threshold of P < 0.005, and only clusters surviving a familywise error correction on the cluster level (pFWE, cluster <0.05) were further considered. VBM data were analyzed using a two-sample t-test. The Threshold Free Cluster Enhancement (TFCE) method was used to derive uncorrected-P statistical results at a P-level of 0.01. RESULTS: The structural analysis revealed two clusters of significantly larger volumes in the hypothalamus, periaqueductal gray, and dorsal raphe region of WT animals. DTI measurements, however, demonstrated statistically higher fractional anisotropy (FA) values for 51KO animals in locations including the anterior commissure, fornix, and posterior commissure/superior colliculus commissure region. DATA CONCLUSION: This study used in vivo structural MRI and DTI to demonstrate that a lack of FKBP51 leads to alterations in brain architecture and connectivity in male mice. These findings are of particular translational relevance for our understanding of the neuroanatomy underlying the interaction of FKBP5 genetic status, stress susceptibility, and psychiatric disorders.

Although less common than upper respiratory symptoms, thrombotic complications are not infrequent and may result in severe and long-term sequelae. Common thrombotic complications include pulmonary embolism, cerebral infarction, or venous thromboembolism; less commonly seen are acute myocardial injury, renal artery thrombosis, and mesenteric ischemia. Several case reports and case series have described acute myocardial injury in patients with COVID-19 characterized by elevations in serum biomarkers. CASE REPORT: Here, we report the first case to our knowledge of a patient with acute coronary syndrome confirmed on catheter angiography and cardiac MRI. This patient was found to additionally have a left ventricular thrombus and ultimately suffered an acute cerebral infarction. Recognition of thrombotic complications in the setting of COVID-19 infection is essential for initiating appropriate therapy. CONCLUSIONS: In acute myocardial injury, given the different treatment strategies for myocarditis versus acute myocardial infarction secondary to coronary artery thrombus, imaging can play a key role in clinical decision making for patients."

In mammals, the core gene regulatory network for melanocytes (their only pigment cell type) contains three transcription factors, Sox10, Pax3 and Mitf, with the latter considered a master regulator of melanocyte development. In teleosts, which have three to four pigment cell types (melanophores, iridophores and xanthophores, plus leucophores e.g. in medaka), gene regulatory networks governing fate specification are poorly understood, although Mitf function is considered conserved. Here, we show that the regulatory relationships between Sox10, Pax3 and Mitf are conserved in zebrafish, but the role for Mitf is more complex than previously emphasized, affecting xanthophore development too. Similarly, medaka Mitf is necessary for melanophore, xanthophore and leucophore formation. Furthermore, expression patterns and mutant phenotypes of pax3 and pax7 suggest that Pax3 and Pax7 act sequentially, activating mitf expression. Pax7 modulates Mitf function, driving co-expressing cells to differentiate as xanthophores and leucophores rather than melanophores. We propose that pigment cell fate specification should be considered to result from the combinatorial activity of Mitf with other transcription factors."

The latter was positive for frusemide in four and for hydrochlorothiazide in the remaining pseudo-Bartter's patients. The two groups of patients did not differ as for plasma Na+, Cl-, K+, HCO3-, renin, and aldosterone, while uric acid and Mg2+ were greater in pseudo-Bartter's patients. Daily and fasting urine Na+, Cl- and K+ excretion were less in pseudo-Bartter's patients; however, there was substantial overlap of values between the two groups. Fractional distal solute reabsorption during maximal water diuresis was low in the six patients with Bartter's syndrome and in two pseudo-Bartter's patients; thus, this parameter could not be taken as a specific diagnostic marker of Bartter's syndrome. Frusemide administration, 40 mg i.v., induced a brisk increase of urine flow (11.7-21.8 ml/min), UOsm (148-186 mOsm/kg H2O) and FENa (14.6-24%) in Bartter's syndrome, but not pseudo-Bartter's patients; in all pseudo-Bartter's patients frusemide-induced changes of UOsm (13-97) and FENa (-0.5 to 10.2) were markedly less than in Bartter's syndrome patients. Frusemide resistance in pseudo-Bartter's patients was most probably related to diuretic-induced ECF volume contraction and increased proximal tubule solute reabsorption; in fact fractional lithium clearance (FELi, a marker of post-proximal solute delivery) was low in pseudo-Bartter's, but not in Bartter's syndrome patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

To investigate whether the H-2b haplotype and/or the lack of expression of I-E molecules play any role in the Yaa-linked acceleration of autoimmune disease, an I-E+ BXSB.H-2d congenic strain was created by backcross procedures. We compared the development of autoimmune disease in the novel BXSB.H-2d (I-E+) strain to that of BXSB.H-2b (I-E-) and BXSB.H-2b/d (I-E+) heterozygous mice. Male BXSB.H-2d (I-E+) mice exhibited only a limited production of autoantibodies and a lower incidence of glomerulonephritis with a markedly prolonged survival rate, which were essentially identical to those of female BXSB mice of both-H-2b and H-2d haplotypes. However, BXSB.H-2b/d (I-E+) heterozygous males developed an accelerated disease comparable to that of conventional BXSB.H-2b (I-E-) male mice. These results indicate that the expression of I-E molecules and consequent clonal deletion or anergy of I-E reactive T cells does not appear to be responsible for the prevention of accelerated autoimmune disease in BXSB.H-2d (I-E+) male mice. The finding that the Yaa gene-induced acceleration of lupus-like autoimmune disease is modulated by gene(s) within or closely linked to the H-2 complex underlines the crucial role of the major histocompatibility complex and the polygenetic nature of autoimmune disease in BXSB mice."

ORACLE Collaborative Group.\nBACKGROUND: Preterm, prelabour rupture of the fetal membranes (pPROM) is the commonest antecedent of preterm birth, and can lead to death, neonatal disease, and long-term disability. Previous small trials of antibiotics for pPROM suggested some health benefits for the neonate, but the results were inconclusive. We did a randomised multicentre trial to try to resolve this issue. METHODS: 4826 women with pPROM were randomly assigned 250 mg erythromycin (n=1197), 325 mg co-amoxiclav (250 mg amoxicillin plus 125 mg clavulanic acid; n=1212), both (n=1192), or placebo (n=1225) four times daily for 10 days or until delivery. The primary outcome measure was a composite of neonatal death, chronic lung disease, or major cerebral abnormality on ultrasonography before discharge from hospital. Analysis was by intention to treat. FINDINGS: Two women were lost to follow-up, and there were 15 protocol violations. Among all 2415 infants born to women allocated erythromycin only or placebo, fewer had the primary composite outcome in the erythromycin group (151 of 1190 [12.7%] vs 186 of 1225 [15.2%], p=0.08) than in the placebo group. Among the 2260 singletons in this comparison, significantly fewer had the composite primary outcome in the erythromycin group (125 of 1111 [11.2%] vs 166 of 1149 [14.4%], p=0.02). Co-amoxiclav only and co-amoxiclav plus erythromycin had no benefit over placebo with regard to this outcome in all infants or in singletons only. Use of erythromycin was also associated with prolongation of pregnancy, reductions in neonatal treatment with surfactant, decreases in oxygen dependence at 28 days of age and older, fewer major cerebral abnormalities on ultrasonography before discharge, and fewer positive blood cultures. Although co-amoxiclav only and co-amoxiclav plus erythromycin were associated with prolongation of pregnancy, they were also associated with a significantly higher rate of neonatal necrotising enterocolitis. INTERPRETATION: Erythromycin for women with pPROM is associated with a range of health benefits for the neonate, and thus a probable reduction in childhood disability. However, co-amoxiclav cannot be routinely recommended for pPROM because of its association with neonatal necrotising enterocolitis. A follow-up study of childhood development and disability after pPROM is planned."

MATERIAL AND METHODS: In our study, we measured the serum levels of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) within the first 50 h of stroke in 60 acute stroke patients, and examined the association with the natural anticoagulants protein C and free protein S. We compared the results with a control group that consisted of 30 volunteers. We also correlated their levels with the clinical outcomes by using the Canadian Neurological Scale (CNS). RESULTS: Neither stroke patients nor the control group had any elevations in IL-1beta serum levels. However, the levels of serum IL-6 were significantly higher in stroke patients (13.7 +/- 19.46 vs. 4.3 +/- 15.88, p = 0.002). In addition, the protein S levels of patients were lower than those of the controls (84.36 +/- 27.97 vs. 95.9 +/- 25.64, p = 0.007). Although IL-6 showed negative correlation with protein S (r = -0.504, p = 0.000), the other studied cytokines TNFalpha and IL-1beta did not correlate with these natural anticoagulants. Another negative correlation was found between IL-6 and CNS scores (r = -0.451, p = 0.000). In addition, both protein C and protein S positively correlated with CNS (r = 0.263, p = 0.042; r = 0.381, p = 0.003). There was also a positive correlation between protein C and protein S (r = 0.408, p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that TNFalpha and IL1beta serum levels are not elevated in the acute phase of stroke and have no correlation with the natural anticoagulants protein C and protein S. However, a decrease in free protein S may be related to elevated IL-6 levels. In addition, increased levels of IL-6 and reduced levels of protein C and protein S may play a role in acute ischemic stroke severity."

The treatment of cardiac H9c2 cells with ZnCl2 (10 microM) in the presence of zinc ionophore pyrithione for 20 min significantly enhanced GSK-3beta phosphorylation at Ser9, indicating that exogenous zinc can inactivate GSK-3beta in H9c2 cells. The effect of zinc on GSK-3beta activity was blocked by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY-294002 but not by the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor rapamycin or the PKC inhibitor chelerythrine, implying that PI3K but not mTOR or PKC accounts for the action of zinc. In support of this interpretation, zinc induced a significant increase in Akt but not mTOR phosphorylation. Further experiments found that zinc also increased mitochondrial GSK-3beta phosphorylation. This may indicate an involvement of the mitochondria in the action of zinc. The effect of zinc on mitochondrial GSK-3beta phosphorylation was not altered by the mitochondrial ATP-sensitive K+ channel blocker 5-hydroxydecanoic acid. Zinc applied at reperfusion reduced cell death in cells subjected to simulated ischemia/reperfusion, indicating that zinc can prevent reperfusion injury. However, zinc was not able to exert protection in cells transfected with the constitutively active GSK-3beta (GSK-3beta-S9A-HA) mutant, suggesting that zinc prevents reperfusion injury by inactivating GSK-3beta. Cells transfected with the catalytically inactive GSK-3beta (GSK-3beta-KM-HA) also revealed a significant decrease in cell death, strongly supporting the essential role of GSK-3beta inactivation in cardioprotection. Moreover, zinc prevented oxidant-induced mPTP opening through the inhibition of GSK-3beta. Taken together, these data suggest that zinc prevents reperfusion injury by modulating the mPTP opening through the inactivation of GSK-3beta. The PI3K/Akt signaling pathway is responsible for the inactivation of GSK-3beta by zinc."

This review will focus on the importance of variability in drug metabolizing enzymes and the potential research and clinical applications of these findings in HIV care. RECENT FINDINGS: The treatment of HIV is complex and involves chronic treatment with multiple drugs and drug classes. Recent research has been important in uncovering genetic differences in drug metabolizing and drug transporter genes, which underpin dose-dependent toxicity and efficacy, but also in genes defining differences in immune response and human leukocyte antigen genes, which restrict processes that are less dependent on the drug dose. SUMMARY: The advancement of pharmacogenetics will continue to further our knowledge of disease-drug interactions and pathogenesis. Ultimately, the goals of pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics in HIV medicine will be the development of the right drugs for the right patient or population. The strong association between HLA-B5701 and abacavir hypersensitivity reaction shows promise for a genetic screening test to be feasibly incorporated into clinical practice. The clinical applicability of many findings demonstrating associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms, particularly in drug metabolism and transporter genes and drug efficacy and toxicity, are currently uncertain."

In this work, we propose a method based on radial basis networks for predicting the number of beta-strands in OMPs and identifying their membrane spanning segments. Our method showed a leave-one-out cross validation accuracy of 96% in a set of 28 OMPs, which have the range of 8-22 beta-strand segments. The beta-strand segments in OMPs and the residues in membrane spanning segments are correctly predicted with the accuracy of 96% and 87%, respectively. We have developed a web server, TMBETAPRED-RBF for predicting the transmembrane beta-strands from amino acid sequence and it is available at http://rbf.bioinfo.tw/~sachen/tmrbf.html. We suggest that our method could be an effective tool for predicting the membrane spanning regions and topology of beta-barrel membrane proteins."

METHODS: A total of 70 patients (31 women) evaluated in the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Clinics of TUrkiye YUksek Ihtisas Hospital, Gastroenterology Department, and 20 healthy controls (10 women) were enrolled in the study. Serum samples were obtained from 40 patients with ulcerative colitis (female/male: 18/22, mean age: 41.5+/-12), 30 patients with Crohn's disease (female/male: 17/13, mean age: 36.9+/-1.9) and 20 healthy controls (female/ male: 10/10, mean age: 32.1+/-1.7). The control group included normal blood donors without gastrointestinal complaints or a familial history of inflammatory bowel disease. Clinical activity in Chron's disease was measured by Crohn disease activity index and in ulcerative colitis patients by Rachmilewitz endoscopic index. Chron's disease patients with a Chron's disease activity index >150 and ulcerative colitis patients with a Rachmilewitz index > or =4 were accepted to have active disease. Determination of transforming growth factor-B1 level was performed with the enzyme- linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Serum transforming growth factor-B1 levels were measured as: Chron's disease 1133.3+/-766.5 pg/ml, ulcerative colitis 1362.5+/-880.6 pg/ml and control group 1230.0+/-572.7 pg/ml. There were no significant differences between the three groups. In patients with active disease in ulcerative colitis, transforming growth factor-B1 level was measured as 1952.5+/-543.7, while this value was 772.5+/-750.5 in patientsin remission in ulcerative colitis. There was a significant difference between patients with active ulcerative colitis and remission ulcerative colitis. CONCLUSIONS: In inflammatory bowel disease, transforming growth factor-B1 can be used as a marker for differential diagnosis of active ulcerative colitis patients and remission ulcerative colitis patients. Nevertheless, more studies with larger patient groups are necessary."

Deamination of adenine by adenosine deaminases that act on RNA (ADARs) leads to the conversion of adenine into inosine (A-I editing) recognized by the splicing and translation systems as guanine. This may modify splicing sites in pre-mRNA and codons in translated regions ofmRNA and also affect the RNA secondary structure. Apart from mRNA, editing also involves microRNAs whose regulatory functions in multicellular animals are associated with the inhibition of transcription of target genes or with the degradation of certain RNA transcripts. ADARs can inhibit the production of mature microRNAs or modify microRNAs so that their specificity to target genes is altered. Adenosine deaminases editing adenines in transport RNAs (ADATs) convert adenine into inosine in tRNAs of all eukaryotes; as a result, the diversity of tRNA forms in the cell increases."

In human rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the most severe inflammatory joint disease, autoantibodies against citrullinated proteins are among the strongest risk factors for bone destruction. We therefore hypothesized that these autoantibodies directly influence bone metabolism. Here, we found a strong and specific association between autoantibodies against citrullinated proteins and serum markers for osteoclast-mediated bone resorption in RA patients. Moreover, human osteoclasts expressed enzymes eliciting protein citrullination, and specific N-terminal citrullination of vimentin was induced during osteoclast differentiation. Affinity-purified human autoantibodies against mutated citrullinated vimentin (MCV) not only bound to osteoclast surfaces, but also led to robust induction of osteoclastogenesis and bone-resorptive activity. Adoptive transfer of purified human MCV autoantibodies into mice induced osteopenia and increased osteoclastogenesis. This effect was based on the inducible release of TNF-alpha from osteoclast precursors and the subsequent increase of osteoclast precursor cell numbers with enhanced expression of activation and growth factor receptors. Our data thus suggest that autoantibody formation in response to citrullinated vimentin directly induces bone loss, providing a link between the adaptive immune system and bone."

Although curcumin is generally considered an antioxidant, it is also able to elicit apoptosis through the generation of ROS, thereby functioning as a pro-oxidant in cancer cells. The present study investigated the effects of antioxidant pretreatment on curcumin-induced cytotoxicity in the human cancer cell lines A2780, MCF-7, and MDA-MB-231. Cytotoxicity was enhanced by trolox, vitamin C or vitamin E; trolox, a water soluble vitamin E derivative, was the most potent. The combination of curcumin (10 muM) and trolox (10-50 muM) induced apoptosis of cancer cells as evidenced by PARP cleavage and caspase-3 activation. Furthermore, expression of the pro-apoptotic protein Bad was up-regulated and expression of the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl was down-regulated in cells that had been treated with trolox plus curcumin. ROS generation was detected in curcumin-treated cells and was significantly enhanced when cells were treated with trolox plus curcumin. Exogenous catalase or SOD1 did not alter cytotoxicity, while over-expression of either catalase or SOD1 did, pointing to the importance of intracellular hydrogen peroxide generation in cell killing. In conclusion, we demonstrated for the first time that antioxidants such as trolox can potentiate cancer cell killing by curcumin, a finding which may help in the development of novel drug combination therapies."

HER2 amplification is associated with metastasis and reduced survival. Two HER2-directed therapies have been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer: trastuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against the extracellular portion of HER2; and lapatinib, a dual HER2- and epidermal growth factor receptor-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Despite the improvement in overall survival with the addition of HER2-targeted agents to chemotherapy, many patients do not benefit from these agents because of inherent resistance. In addition, many patients who achieve an initial response eventually acquire drug resistance. Currently, several mechanisms of resistance have been described, including mutations in other signaling pathways, expression of a truncated form of HER2, receptor crosstalk, and autophagy. There are several approaches under study to target these pathways of resistance, including blocking PI3 kinase and mammalian target of rapamycin signaling, blocking neoangiogenesis and the vascular endothelial growth factor axis, using monoclonal antibody targeting of the HER2 dimerization site, and using HER2 monoclonal antibody-drug conjugates. Here we will review the current scientific rationale for these agents and how combinations of these agents may yield additive or synergistic effects and lead to improved outcomes for patients with HER2-amplified breast cancer."

Sin1 is an essential component of mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2). The functions of Sin1 and mTORC2 remain largely unknown in T cells. Here, we investigate Sin1 function in T cells using mice that lack Sin1 in the hematopoietic system. Sin1 deficiency blocks the mTORC2-dependent Akt phosphorylation in T cells during development and activation. Sin1-deficient T cells exhibit normal thymic cellularity and percentages of double-negative, double-positive, and single-positive CD4(+) and CD8(+) thymocytes. Sin1 deficiency does not impair T-cell receptor (TCR) induced growth and proliferation. Sin1 appears dispensable for in vitro CD4(+) helper cell differentiation. However, Sin1 deficiency results in an increased proportion of Foxp3(+) natural T-regulatory (nTreg) cells in the thymus. The TGF-beta-dependent differentiation of CD4(+) T cells in vitro is enhanced by the inhibition of mTOR but not by loss of Sin1 function. Our results reveal that Sin1 and mTORC2 are dispensable for the development and activation of T cells but play a role in nTreg-cell differentiation."

MCT8 deficiency causes severe psychomotor retardation and abnormal thyroid tests. The great majority of affected children cannot walk or talk, and all have elevated serum T(3) levels, causing peripheral tissue hypermetabolism and inability to maintain weight. Treatment with thyroid hormone is ineffective. In Mct8-deficient mice, the thyroid hormone analog, diiodothyropropionic acid (DITPA), does not require MCT8 to enter tissues and could be an effective alternative to thyroid hormone treatment in humans. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to evaluate the effect and efficacy of DITPA in children with MCT8 deficiency. METHODS: This was a multicenter report of four affected children given DITPA on compassionate grounds for 26-40 months. Treatment was initiated at ages 8.5-25 months, beginning with a small dose of 1.8 mg, increasing to a maximal 30 mg/d (2.1-2.4 mg/kg   d), given in three divided doses. RESULTS: DITPA normalized the elevated serum T(3) and TSH when the dose reached 1 mg/kg   d and T(4) and rT(3) increased to the lower normal range. The following significant changes were also observed: decline in SHBG (in all subjects), heart rate (in three of four), and ferritin (in one of four). Cholesterol increased in two subjects. There was no weight loss and weight gain occurred in two. None of the treated children required a gastric feeding tube or developed seizures. No adverse effects were observed. CONCLUSION: DITPA (1-2 mg/kg   d) almost completely normalizes thyroid tests and reduces the hypermetabolism and the tendency for weight loss. The effects of earlier commencement and long-term therapy remain to be determined."

Various aspects of genetic contribution to the etiology, pathogenesis and outcome of RA are discussed in this review. The heritability of RA has been estimated to be about 60 %, while the contribution of HLA to heritability has been estimated to be 11-37 %. Apart from known shared epitope (SE) alleles, such as HLA-DRB1*01 and DRB1*04, other HLA alleles, such as HLA-DRB1*13 and DRB1*15 have been linked to RA susceptibility. A novel SE classification divides SE alleles into S1, S2, S3P and S3D groups, where primarily S2 and S3P groups have been associated with predisposition to seropositive RA. The most relevant non-HLA gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with RA include PTPN22, IL23R, TRAF1, CTLA4, IRF5, STAT4, CCR6, PADI4. Large genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified more than 30 loci involved in RA pathogenesis. HLA and some non-HLA genes may differentiate between anti-citrullinated protein antibody (ACPA) seropositive and seronegative RA. Genetic susceptibility has also been associated with environmental factors, primarily smoking. Some GWAS studies carried out in rodent models of arthritis have confirmed the role of human genes. For example, in the collagen-induced (CIA) and proteoglycan-induced arthritis (PgIA) models, two important loci - Pgia26/Cia5 and Pgia2/Cia2/Cia3, corresponding the human PTPN22/CD2 and TRAF1/C5 loci, respectively - have been identified.

In response to DNA damage, nuclear FA proteins associate into high molecular weight complexes through a cascade of post-translational modifications and physical interactions, followed by the repair of damaged DNA. Hematopoietic cells are particularly sensitive to the loss of these interactions, and bone marrow failure occurs almost universally in FA patients. FA as a disease is further characterized by cancer susceptibility, which highlights the importance of the FA pathway in tumor suppression, and will be the focus of this review. Acute myeloid leukemia is the most common cancer type, often subsequent to bone marrow failure. However, FA patients are also at an extreme risk of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the head and neck and gynecological tract, with an even greater incidence in those individuals who have received a bone marrow transplant and recovered from hematopoietic disease. FA tumor suppression in hematopoietic versus epithelial compartments could be mechanistically similar or distinct. Definition of compartment specific FA activities is now critical to assess the effects of today's bone marrow failure treatments on tomorrow's solid tumor development. It is our hope that current therapies can then be optimized to decrease the risk of malignant transformation in both hematopoietic and epithelial cells. Here we review our current understanding of the mechanisms of action of the Fanconi anemia pathway as it contributes to stress responses, DNA repair and squamous cell carcinoma susceptibility."

RNA editing is observed in eukaryotic mRNA, transfer RNA, ribosomal RNA, and non-coding RNAs (ncRNA). The most common RNA editing in the mammalian central nervous system is a base modification, where the adenosine residue is base-modified to inosine (A to I). Studies from ADAR (adenosine deaminase that act on RNA) mutants in Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila, and mice clearly show that the RNA editing process is an absolute requirement for nervous system homeostasis and normal physiology of the animal. Understanding the mechanisms of editing and findings of edited substrates has provided a better knowledge of the phenotype due to defective and hyperactive RNA editing. A to I RNA editing is catalyzed by a family of enzymes knows as ADARs. ADARs modify duplex RNAs and editing of duplex RNAs formed by ncRNAs can impact RNA functions, leading to an altered regulatory gene network. Such altered functions by A to I editing is observed in mRNAs, microRNAs (miRNA) but other editing of small and long ncRNAs (lncRNAs) has yet to be identified. Thus, ncRNA and RNA editing may provide key links between neural development, nervous system function, and neurological diseases. This review includes a summary of seminal findings regarding the impact of ncRNAs on biological and pathological processes, which may be further modified by RNA editing. NcRNAs are non-translated RNAs classified by size and function. Known ncRNAs like miRNAs, smallRNAs (smRNAs), PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), and lncRNAs play important roles in splicing, DNA methylation, imprinting, and RNA interference. Of note, miRNAs are involved in development and function of the nervous system that is heavily dependent on both RNA editing and the intricate spatiotemporal expression of ncRNAs.

BACKGROUND: There are limited data on outcomes following cardioversion or catheter ablation in AF patients treated with factor Xa inhibitors. METHODS: We compared the incidence of electrical cardioversion (ECV), pharmacologic cardioversion (PCV), or AF ablation and subsequent outcomes in patients in a post hoc analysis of the ROCKET AF (Efficacy and Safety Study of Rivaroxaban With Warfarin for the Prevention of Stroke and Non-Central Nervous System Systemic Embolism in Patients With Non-Valvular Atrial Fibrillation) trial. RESULTS: Over a median follow-up of 2.1 years, 143 patients underwent ECV, 142 underwent PCV, and 79 underwent catheter ablation. The overall incidence of ECV, PCV, or AF ablation was 1.45 per 100 patient-years (n = 321; 1.44 [n = 161] in the warfarin arm, 1.46 [n = 160] in the rivaroxaban arm). The crude rates of stroke and death increased in the first 30 days after cardioversion or ablation. After adjustment for baseline differences, the long-term incidence of stroke or systemic embolism (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.38; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.61 to 3.11), cardiovascular death (HR: 1.57; 95% CI: 0.69 to 3.55), and death from all causes (HR: 1.75; 95% CI: 0.90 to 3.42) were not different before and after cardioversion or AF ablation. Hospitalization increased after cardioversion or AF ablation (HR: 2.01; 95% CI: 1.51 to 2.68), but there was no evidence of a differential effect by randomized treatment (p value for interaction = 0.58). The incidence of stroke or systemic embolism (1.88% vs. 1.86%) and death (1.88% vs. 3.73%) were similar in the rivaroxaban-treated and warfarin-treated groups.

Both complexes are sensitive to a pharmacological inhibitor, torin1, although only mTORC1 is inhibited by rapamycin. Since mTORC2 is known to mediate the activation of a prosurvival kinase, Akt, we analyzed whether mTORC2 directly mediates Akt activation or whether it requires the participation of another prosurvival kinase, PKCepsilon (epsilon isoform of protein kinase-C). Our studies reveal that treatment of adult feline cardiomyocytes in vitro with insulin results in Akt phosphorylation at S473 for its activation which could be augmented with rapamycin but blocked by torin1. Silencing the expression of Rictor (rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR), an mTORC2 component, with a sh-RNA in cardiomyocytes lowers both insulin-stimulated Akt and PKCepsilon phosphorylation. Furthermore, phosphorylation of PKCepsilon and Akt at the critical S729 and S473 sites respectively was blocked by torin1 or Rictor knockdown but not by rapamycin, indicating that the phosphorylation at these specific sites occurs downstream of mTORC2. Additionally, expression of DN-PKCepsilon significantly lowered the insulin-stimulated Akt S473 phosphorylation, indicating an upstream role for PKCepsilon in the Akt activation. Biochemical analyses also revealed that PKCepsilon was part of Rictor but not Raptor (a binding partner and component of mTORC1). Together, these studies demonstrate that mTORC2 mediates prosurvival signaling in adult cardiomyocytes where PKCepsilon functions downstream of mTORC2 leading to Akt activation. "

Identification of specific targets for the treatment of drug-resistant p53-null tumors would therefore increase the effectiveness of cancer therapy. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: By using a kinase-directed short hairpin RNA library and HCT116p53KO drug-resistant colon carcinoma cells, glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3B) was identified as a target whose silencing bypasses drug resistance due to loss of p53. p53-null colon cancer cell lines with different sets of mutations were used to validate the role of GSK3B in sustaining resistance and to characterize cell death mechanisms triggered by chemotherapy when GSK3B is silenced. In vivo xenograft studies were conducted to confirm resensitization of drug-resistant cells to chemotherapy upon GSK3 inhibition. Colon cancer samples from a cohort of 50 chemotherapy-treated stage II patients were analyzed for active GSK3B expression. RESULTS: Downregulation of GSK3B in various drug-resistant p53-null colon cancer cell lines abolished cell viability and colony growth after drug addition without affecting cell proliferation or cell cycle in untreated cells. Cell death of 5-fluorouracil (5FU)-treated p53-null GSK3B-silenced colon carcinoma cells occurred via PARP1-dependent and AIF-mediated but RIP1-independent necroptosis. In vivo studies showed that drug-resistant xenograft tumor mass was significantly reduced only when 5FU was given after GSK3B inhibition. Tissue microarray analysis of colon carcinoma samples from 5FU-treated patients revealed that GSK3B is significantly more activated in drug-resistant versus responsive patients. CONCLUSIONS: Targeting GSK3B, in combination with chemotherapy, may represent a novel strategy for the treatment of chemotherapy-resistant tumors."

In detail, the endothelium that aligns the vasculature of most organs is fundamental in maintaining organ homeostasis and in promoting organ recovery following injury. Mechanistically, endothelial cells (EC) of tissues such as the liver, lungs or the bone marrow (BM) have been shown to produce \"angiocrine\" factors that promote organ recovery and restore normal organ function. Controlled production of angiocrine factors following organ injury is therefore essential to promote organ regeneration and to restore organ function. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the coordinated production and function of such \"angiocrine\" factors are largely undisclosed and were the subject of the present study. In detail, we identified for the first time a microRNA (miRNA) expressed by BM EC that regulates the expression of angiocrine genes involved in BM recovery following irradiation. Using a microarray-based approach, we identified several miRNA expressed by irradiated BMEC. After validating the variations in miRNA expression by semi-quantitative PCR, we chose to study further the ones showing consistent variations between experiments, and those predicted to regulate (directly or indirectly) angiogenic and angiocrine factors. Of the mi-RNA that were chosen, miR-363-5p (previously termed miR-363*) was subsequently shown to modulate the expression of numerous EC-specific genes including some angiocrine factors. By luciferase reporter assays, miR-363-5p is shown to regulate the expression of angiocrine factors tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (Timp-1) and thrombospondin 3 (THBS3) at post-transcriptional level. Moreover, miR-363-5p reduction using anti-miR is shown to affect EC angiogenic properties (such as the response to angiogenic factors stimulation) and the interaction between EC and hematopoietic precursors (particularly relevant in a BM setting). miR-363-5p reduction resulted in a significant decrease in EC tube formation on matrigel, but increased hematopoietic precursor cells adhesion onto EC, a mechanism that is shown to involve kit ligand-mediated cell adhesion. Taken together, we have identified a miRNA induced by irradiation that regulates angiocrine factors expression on EC and as such modulates EC properties. Further studies on the importance of miR-363-5p on normal BM function and in disease are warranted. "

        "text": "Interactions between JARID2 and noncoding RNAs regulate PRC2 recruitment to chromatin.\nJARID2 is an accessory component of Polycomb repressive complex-2 (PRC2) required for the differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs). A role for JARID2 in the recruitment of PRC2 to target genes silenced during differentiation has been put forward, but the molecular details remain unclear. We identified a 30-amino-acid region of JARID2 that mediates interactions with long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and found that the presence of lncRNAs stimulated JARID2-EZH2 interactions in vitro and JARID2-mediated recruitment of PRC2 to chromatin in vivo. Native and crosslinked RNA immunoprecipitations of JARID2 revealed that Meg3 and other lncRNAs from the imprinted Dlk1-Dio3 locus, an important regulator of development, interacted with PRC2 via JARID2. Lack of MEG3 expression in human induced pluripotent cells altered the chromatin distribution of JARID2, PRC2, and H3K27me3. Our findings show that lncRNAs facilitate JARID2-PRC2 interactions on chromatin and suggest a mechanism by which lncRNAs contribute to PRC2 recruitment. "

Epigenetic information transcends that of the genotype alone and provides for an integrated etiologic picture of cardiovascular disease pathogenesis because of the interaction of the epigenome with the environment. Epigenetic biomarkers, which include DNA methylation, histone modifications, and RNA-based mechanisms, are both modifiable and cell-type specific, which makes them not only responsive to the environment, but also an attractive target for drug development. However, the enthusiasm surrounding possible applications of cardiovascular epigenetics currently outpaces available evidence. In this review, the authors synthesize the evidence linking epigenetic changes with cardiovascular disease, emphasizing the gap between the translational potential and the clinical reality of cardiovascular epigenetics.

However, its functional long-term effect and the cardioprotective mechanisms at the level of cardiomyocytes have not been elucidated, and the impact of beta3AR stimulation has not been evaluated in a more translational large animal model. This study aimed at evaluating pre-perfusion administration of BRL37344 both in small and large animal models of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion. Pre-reperfusion administration of the beta3AR agonist BRL37344 (5 mug/kg) reduced infarct size at 2-and 24-h reperfusion in wild-type mice. Long-term (12-weeks) left ventricular (LV) function assessed by echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) was significantly improved in beta3AR agonist-treated mice. Incubation with beta3AR agonist (BRL37344, 7 mumol/L) significantly reduced cell death in isolated adult mouse cardiomyocytes during hypoxia/reoxygenation and decreased susceptibility to deleterious opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), via a mechanism dependent on the Akt-NO signaling pathway. Pre-reperfusion BRL37344 administration had no effect on infarct size in cyclophilin-D KO mice, further implicating mPTP in the mechanism of protection. Large-white pigs underwent percutaneous coronary ischemia/reperfusion and 3-T CMR at 7 and 45 days post-infarction. Pre-perfusion administration of BRL37344 (5 mug/kg) decreased infarct size and improved long-term LV contractile function. A single-dose administration of beta3AR agonist before reperfusion decreased infarct size and resulted in a consistent and long-term improvement in cardiac function, both in small and large animal models of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion. This protection appears to be executed through inhibition of mPTP opening in cardiomyocytes. "

To exploit this differential expression pattern for targeted cancer therapy, an EpCAM-targeted immunotoxin was developed and its antitumor activity was investigated in vitro. An immunotoxin (scFv2A9-PE or APE) was constructed by genetically fusing a truncated form (PE38KDEL) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin with an anti-EpCAM single-chain variable fragment (scFv). ELISA and flow cytometry were performed to verify immunotoxin (scFv2A9-PE or APE) antigen-binding activity with EpCAM. Cytotoxicity was measured by MTT assay. Confocal microscopy was used to observe its cellular localization. The results of ELISA and flow cytometry revealed that the immunotoxin efficiently recognized recombinant and natural EpCAM. Its antigen-binding activity was relatively lower than 2A9. MTT assay confirmed potent reduction in EpCAM-positive HHCC (human hepatocellular carcinoma) cell viability (IC50 50 pM). Immunofluorescence revealed that the immunotoxin localized to endoplasmic reticulum 24 h later. In conclusion, we described the development of an EpCAM-targeted immunotoxin with potent activity against tumor cells, which may lay the foundation for future development of therapeutic antibody for the treatment of EpCAM-positive tumors.

METHODS: Studies eligible for our analysis included randomized Phase II and III trials of patients with cancer on ipilimumab, nivolumab, pembrolizumab, tremelimumab and pidilizumab, which describe events of elevated transaminases [alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST)]. RESULTS: Initial database search revealed 210 relevant citations. After excluding noneligible studies, 10 trials were considered eligible for the quantitative synthesis. The RR of all-grade elevated ALT and AST was 2.36 (95% CI 1.20-4.66; p = 0.01) and 1.53 (95% CI 0.73-3.22; p = 0.26), respectively, whereas for high-grade elevated ALT and AST, it was 11.27 (95% CI 5.38-23.63; p < 0.0001) and 4.9 (95% CI 2.97-8.09; p < 0.0001), respectively.

DATA SOURCES: Searches of MEDLINE (1946 to July 1, 2017) were conducted using the keywords QTERN, saxagliptin, and dapagliflozin. Additional data were obtained from the prescribing information, the product dossier, and Clinicaltrials.gov . STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: All English language articles related to pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, or safety of the combination therapy in human subjects were reviewed. DATA SYNTHESIS: The pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin and dapagliflozin were not affected significantly when administered as an FDC product. Saxagliptin may suppress the increased secretion of glucagon associated with dapagliflozin. The combination dapagliflozin/saxagliptin has been studied as add-on therapy to metformin in patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The difference in hemoglobin A1C (A1C) between saxagliptin + dapagliflozin + metformin (triple therapy) and saxagliptin + metformin was -0.59 (95% CI = -0.81 to -0.37, P < 0.0001), and the difference between triple therapy and dapagliflozin + metformin was -0.27 (95% CI = -0.48 to -0.05, P = 0.0166). The combination was well tolerated when added to metformin. CONCLUSION: QTERN (dapagliflozin/saxagliptin) tablets are a reasonable option for patients with T2DM not controlled on metformin, but cost, insurance coverage, and a lackluster reduction in A1C will likely limit its use until more data regarding its effects on complications of diabetes and cardiovascular outcomes become available."

We aimed to assess the performance of early and late (within 48 hr posttrauma) signs for BSF diagnosis and to verify the correlation between the presence of these signs and head injury severity. We conducted a prospectively designed follow-up study at a referral hospital for trauma care in Sao Paulo, Brazil, and performed structured observations for 48 hr post-blunt head injury in patients aged 12 years or older. The following signs of BSF were considered: raccoon eyes, Battle's sign, otorrhea, and rhinorrhea. Among the 136 enrolled patients (85.3% male; mean age 40 +- 21.4 years), 28 patients (20.6%) had BSF. The clinical signs for the early or late detection of BSF had low accuracy (55.9% vs. 43.4%), specificity (52.8% vs. 30.5%), and positive predictive value (25.7% vs. 27.1%). However, the presence of these signs was correlated to head injury severity, indicated by the Glasgow Coma Scale (p = .041) and Maximum Abbreviated Injury Scale-Head region (p = .002). In view of the low accuracy of these signs, resulting low clinical value of their presence, and their high sensitivity in the late stage, the study results contraindicate the value of BSF signs for making decisions about using the nasal route for the introduction of catheters and tubes in initial trauma care."

A phase 1, non-randomised, open-label, multiple-dose study was done to assess the safety, tolerability, and activity of trastuzumab deruxtecan in HER2-expressing advanced solid tumours. The dose escalation (part 1) has previously been reported and the recommended doses for expansion of 5 4 mg/kg or 6 4 mg/kg were established. In this Article, we report the safety and preliminary activity results from this phase 1 trial in all patients with HER2-positive gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer who received trastuzumab deruxtecan at the recommended doses for expansion. METHODS: This was an open-label, dose-escalation and dose-expansion phase 1 trial done at eight hospitals and clinics in the USA and six in Japan. Eligible patients were at least 18 years old in the USA and at least 20 years old in Japan and had advanced solid tumours (regardless of HER2 expression in dose escalation or HER2 expression or mutation in dose expansion). The recommended doses for expansion of 5 4 mg/kg or 6 4 mg/kg trastuzumab deruxtecan were administered intravenously to patients once every 3 weeks until withdrawal of consent, unacceptable toxicity, or progressive disease. In this Article, all patients with HER2-positive gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer with previous trastuzumab treatment who received trastuzumab deruxtecan were analysed together. The primary endpoints of the study were safety and preliminary activity (proportion of patients who achieved an objective response as assessed by the investigators). The activity evaluable set included all patients who received at least one dose of trastuzumab deruxtecan at the recommended doses for expansion, and for whom both baseline and post-treatment activity data were available. The safety analysis set included all patients who received at least one dose of trastuzumab deruxtecan at the recommended doses for expansion. Enrolment for patients with gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer has completed. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02564900, and ClinicalTrials.jp, number JapicCTI-152978. FINDINGS: Between Aug 28, 2015, and Aug 10, 2018, 44 patients with HER2-positive gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer received at least one dose of trastuzumab deruxtecan at the recommended doses for expansion. All patients had at least one treatment-emergent adverse event. The most frequent grade 3 or worse treatment-emergent adverse events included anaemia (13 [30%]) and decreases in neutrophil (nine [20%]), platelet (eight [18%]), and white blood cell (seven [16%]) counts. Serious treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 11 (25%) patients. There were four pneumonitis cases (three grade 2 and one grade 3). There were no drug-related deaths due to treatment-emergent adverse events. 19 (43 2%; 95% CI 28 3-59 0) of 44 patients had a confirmed objective response. INTERPRETATION: Trastuzumab deruxtecan had a manageable safety profile and showed preliminary activity in heavily pretreated patients with HER2-positive gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer. These results support further investigation of trastuzumab deruxtecan for HER2-positive gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer post-trastuzumab. FUNDING: Daiichi Sankyo Co, Ltd."

Microglia, resident macrophages in the CNS, have a central role in the brain immune system and have been reported to be activated by NA. However, intracellular signaling mechanisms of the AR-mediated proinflammatory responses of microglia are not fully understood. Using a rapid and stable in vitro reporter assay system to evaluate IL-1beta production in microglial BV2 cells, we found that NA and the beta-AR agonist isoproterenol upregulated the IL-1beta reporter activity. This effect was suppressed by beta-AR antagonists. We further examined the involvement of EPAC (exchange protein directly activated by cAMP) and TPL2 (tumor progression locus 2, MAP3K8) and found that inhibitors for EPAC and TPL2 reduced AR agonist-induced IL-1beta reporter activity. These inhibitors also suppressed NA-induced endogenous Il1b mRNA expression and IL-1beta protein production. Our results suggest that EPAC and TPL2 are involved in beta-AR-mediated IL-1beta production in microglial cells, and extend our understanding of its intracellular signaling mechanism."

The aim of this study was to develop a simple, rapid, sensitive, and validated isocratic reversed phase-high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) method for the simultaneous estimation of saxagliptin and dapagliflozin in human plasma using linagliptin as internal standard as per US-Food and Drug Administration guidelines. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The method was performed on a Waters 2695 HPLC equipped with a quaternary pump. The analyte separation was achieved using an Eclipse XDB C18 (150 x 4.6 mm x 5 microm) column with a mobile phase consisting of 0.1% ortho phosphoric acid and acetonitrile (50:50) with pH adjusted to 5.0 at 1 mL/min flow rate. RESULTS: The analyte was detected at 254 nm. The retention time of the internal standard, saxagliptin, and dapagliflozin was 2.746, 5.173, and 7.218 min, respectively. The peaks were found to be free of interference. The method was validated over a dynamic linear range of 0.01 to 0.5 mug/mL and 0.05 to 2 mug/mL for saxagliptin and dapagliflozin, respectively, with a correlation coefficient of 0.998. The precision and accuracy of samples of six replicate measurements at lower limits of quantification level were within the limits. The analytes were found to be stable in human plasma at -28 C for 37 days. CONCLUSION: The stability, sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility of this method make it appropriate for the determination of saxagliptin and dapagliflozin in human plasma."

The role of IL-17 in the pathogenesis of numerous inflammatory disorders is well-documented. IL-17 activates signaling through the IL-17 receptor, which induces other proinflammatory cytokines, antimicrobial peptides, and neutrophil chemokines that are important for antifungal activity. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Healthy levels of IL-17 can protect the host against extracellular bacterial and fungal infections in mucous membranes and epithelia. IL-17 deficiency reduces control of certain infections, while excessive IL-17 can produce unwanted inflammatory effects. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Although the efficacy of the therapeutic blockade of this cytokine has been proven in several autoimmune diseases such as psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, this strategy could also exacerbate fungal infections in such patients. Therefore, a better understanding of IL-17-mediated immunity to Candida is necessary for the development of autoimmune therapeutics that maintain antifungal immunity. CONCLUSIONS: In this review, we include a study of the new anti-IL-17 biological agents (secukinumab, ixekizumab, and bromalizumab) used for moderate-to-severe psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis treatment in clinical practice, as well as pivotal trials with bimekizumab.

In the past few decades, advances in the knowledge of psoriasis pathogenesis have driven the development of highly effective targeted biologic therapies, transforming the treatment landscape of psoriasis. Bimekizumab is a humanized antibody that selectively binds and neutralizes the biologic functions of interleukin (IL)-17A and IL-17F. This article reviews the current knowledge about bimekizumab in psoriasis treatment. The results obtained in the phase 3 studies (BE VIVID, BE READY, BE RADIANT, BE SURE) corroborate the high levels of efficacy of bimekizumab seen in previous studies, and show superior efficacy over adalimumab, ustekinumab, and secukinumab in direct comparative studies. In all phase 3 trials, bimekizumab was also well tolerated, with a safety profile similar to the other biologic drugs tested, except for a higher frequency of oral candidiasis. Dual inhibition of IL-17A and IL-17F is a highly effective therapeutic option for the treatment of psoriasis, both for naive patients and for those resistant to previous biologic treatments."

Our aim was to evaluate ex vivo the capacity of the combination of atezolizumab (anti-PD-L1) and tiragolumab (anti-TIGIT) to reactivate the immune response of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in MSS-CRC. We analysed CRC tumor tissue and the associated blood sample in parallel. For each patient sample, extensive immunomonitoring and cytokine production were tested. We generated an ex vivo assay to study immune reactivity following immune stimulation with checkpoint inhibitors of tumor cell suspensions. Three microsatellite instable (MSI) and 13 MSS-CRC tumors were analysed. To generalize our observations, bioinformatics analyses were performed on public data of single cell RNA sequencing of CRC TILs and RNA sequencing data of TCGA. Atezolizumab alone could only reactivate T cells from MSI tumors. Atezolizumab and tiragolumab reactivated T cells in 46% of MSS-CRC samples. Reactivation by ICK was observed in patients with higher baseline frequency of Th1 and Tc1 cells, and was also associated with higher baseline T cell polyfunctionality and higher CD96 expression. We showed that a high frequency of CD96 expression on T cells could be a surrogate marker of atezolizumab and tiragolumab efficacy. Together these data suggest that the association of atezolizumab and tiragolumab could restore function of CD4 and CD8 TILs in MSS-CRC and could be tested in a clinical trial in colorectal cancer patients with MSS status."

Symptomatic uterine fibroids present with menstrual problems, anemia, infertility, miscarriages, an enlarged abdomen, pressure symptoms involving the bladder and bowels (such as frequent urination or constipation), and sometimes coital-related problems. This case report describes a 25-year-old African American woman with uterine fibroids who suffered from lower back pain radiating to the left lower extremity, along with paresthesias and weakness of the left leg. She was diagnosed with lumbar radiculopathy, early pregnancy, and an incidental finding of a Tarlov cyst. As the pregnancy progressed, the sciatic pain ceased within the first trimester. Sciatic pain can result from a sudden increase in the uterus size caused by an early pregnancy coexisting with large fibroids.

Teplizumab, an anti-CD3 monoclonal, delays T1D onset in patients at risk, but additional therapies are needed to prevent the disease entirely. Therefore, bifunctional molecules were designed to selectively inhibit T1D-promoting anti-insulin B cells by conjugating a ligand for the B cell inhibitory receptor CD22 (i.e., CD22L) to insulin, which permit these molecules to concomitantly bind to anti-insulin B cell receptors (BCRs) and CD22. Two prototypes were synthesized: 2:2 insulin-CD22L conjugate on a 4-arm PEG backbone, and 1:1 insulin-CD22L direct conjugate. Transgenic mice (125TgSD) expressing anti-insulin BCRs provided cells for in vitro testing. Cells were cultured with constructs for 3 days, then assessed by flow cytometry. Duplicate wells with anti-CD40 simulated T cell help. A 2-insulin 4-arm PEG control caused robust proliferation and activation-induced CD86 upregulation. Anti-CD40 further boosted these effects. This may indicate that BCR-cross-linking occurs when antigens are tethered by the PEG backbone as soluble insulin alone has no effect. Addition of CD22L via the 2:2 insulin-CD22L conjugate restored B cell properties to that of controls without an additional beneficial effect. In contrast, the 1:1 insulin-CD22L direct conjugate significantly reduced anti-insulin B cell proliferation in the presence of anti-CD40. CD22L alone had no effect, and the constructs did not affect the WT B cells. Thus, multivalent antigen constructs tend to activate anti-insulin B cells, while monomeric antigen-CD22L conjugates reduce B cell activation in response to simulated T cell help and reduce pathogenic B cell numbers without harming normal cells. Therefore, monomeric antigen-CD22L conjugates warrant futher study and may be promising candidates for preclinical trials to prevent T1D without inducing immunodeficiency."

Some small vesicles, 0.1 to 0.5 micron in diameter, were outlined by plasma membrane (matrix vesicles), other larger ones, about 1 to several micron in diameter, were invested by a thick wall (matrix giant bodies). Mineralized deposits were frequent in these vesicles and occasionally large masses of mineralized connective tissue fibers (psammoma bodies) were seen. Analysis of the material in the mineralized vesicles and fibers, using an energy dispersive X-ray microanalyzer, showed that both calcium and phosphorous were evident and hydroxyapatite was substantiated using an X-ray diffractometer.

Subsequently, calcification occurs in these vesicles, and the mineralization process extends to neighboring connective tissue fibers. The calcified mass forms a psammoma body."

In plasma and other body fluids, released or soluble Fc gamma RIII has been found in considerable amounts. In the present study, neutrophils were kept in maintenance culture for 18 to 24 hours. Forty percent of the neutrophils completely lost Fc gamma RIII, and the remainder of the cells showed a 60% decrease in Fc gamma RIII expression on their surface. Released Fc gamma RIII was detected in the culture supernatant. Nevertheless, more than 90% of the cells was viable as judged by hydrolysis of fluorescein diacetate. The presence of interferon gamma, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, but not interleukin-3 (IL-3), IL-6, or IL-8, in the culture medium increased the number of cells that still expressed Fc gamma RIII. We found that this loss of Fc gamma RIII was not the result of cell activation but correlated strongly with apoptosis. The Fc gamma RIII-negative subpopulation exhibited typical morphologic changes, such as nuclear condensation and DNA fragmentation. Furthermore, this subpopulation appeared to have acquired the property of binding Annexin V, a calcium-dependent, phospholipid-binding protein with high affinity for phosphatidylserine. The external exposure of this phospholipid by cells has been reported to occur during apoptosis. The property of Annexin V binding was not shared by the nonapoptotic, Fc gamma RIII-positive subpopulation. In this respect, we identified binding of Annexin V as an convenient marker for apoptotic cells. Our results indicate that soluble Fc gamma RIII in body fluids might be derived for a large part from neutrophils undergoing apoptosis in the tissues."

Random digit dial was used to select 801 control subjects from the three geographical regions to obtain a case:control ratio of 1:2 in San Francisco and Seattle and 1:1 in Los Angeles. The data first were analyzed separately by geographical site and then were combined with adjustments made for gender, age at the time of diagnosis (or reference date of control subjects), birth year of the index child, and maternal race. No association was found between the risk of CBTs and maternal or paternal smoking before pregnancy and there was no association between CBTs and maternal smoking during pregnancy [odds ratio (OR) = 0.98; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.72-1.3].

It has been hypothesized that some cases of postoperative diplopia and blepharoptosis could be attributed to the myotoxic effects of local anesthetics to the extraocular muscles and the levator muscle or to the neurotoxic effects of lidocaine. In 30 cadavers, the superior division of the oculomotor nerve was severed en bloc 1.5 cm anterior to the annulus of Zinn with the levator palpebrae superioris (LPS) and the superior rectus muscles. These muscles were detached from their origins, and their attachments to the scleral and tarsal plates were divided respectively. The specimens were treated in guanidine-hydrochloride and Alizarin Red solution, and were dissected under an operating microscope. The nerve branches of the superior division of the oculomotor nerve innervated the proximal third (type I) in 2 of 30 LPS muscles (6.7%), in 8 of 30 muscles (26.7%) extended to the middle third (type II), and reached the distal third (type III) in 20 of 30 muscles (66.7%). The terminal branches ran through the medial third (type IIIa) in 6 of 20 type III LPS muscles (30%), the central third (type IIIb) in 8 muscles(40%), and the lateral third (type IIIc) in 6 muscles (30%). The oculomotor nerve ends that extend forward to the distal third of the LPS muscle (type III) are exposed and vulnerable to local anesthetics and may be numbed during blepharoplasty. If this is so, postoperative blepharoptosis may be caused by transient paralysis of the LPS muscle, and great care should be taken during the injection of local anesthetics near the LPS."

MITF encodes a transcription factor that is essential for normal melanocyte development and appears to regulate expression of several pigmentation genes. In this report, the possibility was examined that MITF might additionally regulate expression of the SILV and MLANA genes. Both genes contain conserved MITF consensus DNA sequences that were bound by MITF in vitro and in vivo, based on electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin-immunoprecipitation. In addition, MITF regulated their promoter/enhancer regions in reporter assays, and up- or down-regulation of MITF produced corresponding modulation of endogenous SILV and MLANA in melanoma cells. Expression patterns were compared with these factors in a series of melanoma cell lines whose mutational status of the proto-oncogene BRAF was also known. SILV and MLANA expression correlated with MITF, while no clear correlation was seen relative to BRAF mutation. Finally, mRNA expression array analysis of primary human melanomas demonstrated a tight correlation in their expression levels in clinical tumor specimens. Collectively, this study links three important melanoma antigens into a common transcriptional pathway regulated by MITF."

        "text": "Bartter syndrome.\nPURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review describes recent advances in our understanding of the genetic heterogeneity, pathophysiology and treatment of Bartter syndrome, a group of autosomal recessive disorders that are characterized by markedly reduced or absent salt transport by the thick ascending limb of Henle. Consequently, individuals with Bartter syndrome exhibit renal salt wasting and lowered blood pressure, hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis and hypercalciuria with a variable risk of renal stones. RECENT FINDINGS: Previously, three genes (SLC12A2, the sodium-potassium-chloride co-transporter; KCNJ1, the ROMK potassium ion channel; ClC-Kb, the basolateral chloride ion channel) had been identified as causing antenatal and 'classic' Bartter syndrome. Two additional genes have now been identified. Barttin is a beta-subunit that is required for the trafficking of CLC-K (both ClC-Ka and ClC-Kb) channels to the plasma membrane in both the thick ascending limb and the marginal cells in the scala media of the inner ear that secrete potassium ion-rich endolymph. Loss-of-function mutations in barttin thus cause Bartter syndrome with sensorineural deafness. In addition, severe gain-of-function mutations in the extracellular calcium ion-sensing receptor can result in a Bartter phenotype because activation of this G protein-coupled receptor inhibits salt transport in the thick ascending limb (a furosemide-like effect). SUMMARY: Five genes have been identified as causing Bartter syndrome (types I-V), with the unifying pathophysiology being the loss of salt transport by the thick ascending limb. Phenotypic differences in Bartter types I-V relate to the specific physiological roles of the individual genes in the kidney and other organ systems."

Three weeks after MI, adult Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to DITPA (375 microg/100 g subcutaneous) or no treatment of 3 weeks. In MI rats, left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic pressure and LV dP/dt decreased (P < 0.05). DITPA did not change MAP (87 +/- 10 versus 90 +/- 7 mm Hg) or LV end-diastolic pressure (23 +/- 3 versus 19 +/- 9 mm Hg) but did lower (P < 0.05) LV dP/dt (4,633 +/- 797 versus 3,650 +/- 1,236 mm Hg/s). In aortic segments from MI rats, DITPA enhanced the acetylcholine dependent vasorelaxation (59 +/- 11% at 10(-4) M, P < 0.05) and isoproterenol induced vasorelaxation (57 +/- 13% at 10(-4) M, P < 0.05). The increases in vasorelaxation were blocked with l-NAME and restored with L-arginine. Treatment with DITPA increased (P < 0.05) eNOS protein content in aortic tissue from sham rats (3.8 +/- 2.8 to 44.5 +/- 7.1 integrated intensity units (II)/microg) and in MI rats (5.3 +/- 3.4 to 28.3 +/- 8.9 II/microg).

They cause seizures and cerebral hemorrhages, which can result in focal neurological deficits. Three CCM loci have been mapped, and loss-of-function mutations were identified in the KRIT1 (CCM1) and MGC4607 (CCM2) genes. We report herein the identification of PDCD10 (programmed cell death 10) as the CCM3 gene. The CCM3 locus has been previously mapped to 3q26-27 within a 22-cM interval that is bracketed by D3S1763 and D3S1262. We hypothesized that genomic deletions might occur at the CCM3 locus, as reported previously to occur at the CCM2 locus. Through high-density microsatellite genotyping of 20 families, we identified, in one family, null alleles that resulted from a deletion within a 4-Mb interval flanked by markers D3S3668 and D3S1614. This de novo deletion encompassed D3S1763, which strongly suggests that the CCM3 gene lies within a 970-kb region bracketed by D3S1763 and D3S1614. Six additional distinct deleterious mutations within PDCD10, one of the five known genes mapped within this interval, were identified in seven families. Three of these mutations were nonsense mutations, and two led to an aberrant splicing of exon 9, with a frameshift and a longer open reading frame within exon 10. The last of the six mutations led to an aberrant splicing of exon 5, without frameshift. Three of these mutations occurred de novo. All of them cosegregated with the disease in the families and were not observed in 200 control chromosomes. PDCD10, also called \"TFAR15,\" had been initially identified through a screening for genes differentially expressed during the induction of apoptosis in the TF-1 premyeloid cell line. It is highly conserved in both vertebrates and invertebrates. Its implication in cerebral cavernous malformations strongly suggests that it is a new player in vascular morphogenesis and/or remodeling."

Cardiovascular disease is one of the most prevalent causes of death in DM patients. Electrophysiological studies in cardiac muscles from DM patients and from DMPK(-/-) mice suggested that DMPK is critical to the modulation of cardiac contractility and to the maintenance of proper cardiac conduction activity. However, there are no data regarding the molecular signaling pathways involved in DM heart failure. Here we show that DMPK expression in cardiac myocytes is highly enriched in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) where it colocalizes with the ryanodine receptor and phospholamban (PLN), a muscle-specific SR Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA2a) inhibitor. Coimmunoprecipitation studies showed that DMPK and PLN can physically associate. Furthermore, purified wild-type DMPK, but not a kinase-deficient mutant (K110A DMPK), phosphorylates PLN in vitro. Subsequent studies using the DMPK(-/-) mice demonstrated that PLN is hypo-phosphorylated in SR vesicles from DMPK(-/-) mice compared with wild-type mice both in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we show that Ca(2+) uptake in SR is impaired in ventricular homogenates from DMPK(-/-) mice. Together, our data suggest the existence of a novel regulatory DMPK pathway for cardiac contractility and provide a molecular mechanism for DM heart pathology."

At present, five different genetic variants have been demonstrated. The majority of patients with so-called classic Bartter syndrome carry inactivating mutations of the CLCNKB gene encoding the basolateral ClC-Kb chloride channel (Bartter syndrome type III). The purpose of this study was to investigate the underlying mutation in cases of classic Bartter syndrome followed at our center. Ten patients, including two sisters, with clinical and biochemical features of classic Bartter syndrome were included in the mutational analysis. They originated from different regions of Spain with either Basque or Spanish ancestry. There was no history of consanguineous marriage in any of the kindreds. The parents and siblings of each patient, as well as a population of 300 healthy control adult subjects, were also analyzed. All ten patients were found to be homozygous for an identical missense mutation in the CLCNKB gene, substituting a threonine for an alanine at codon 204 (A204T) in the putative fifth transmembrane domain of the protein. None of the 300 control subjects were homozygous for the A204T allele. Overall, the A204T mutation was detected on 2/600 control chromosomes. Despite sharing a common mutation, the clinical manifestations of the syndrome in the patients varied from lack of symptoms to severe growth retardation. Demonstration of a point mutation within the CLCNKB gene as the apparently unique cause of Bartter syndrome type III in Spain is highly suggestive of a founder effect. Our results also support the lack of correlation between genotype and phenotype in this disease."

Independent groups have shown a strong predictive association between ABC HSR and HLA-B*5701, indicating that exclusion of HLA-B*5701 positive individuals from abacavir treatment would largely prevent ABC HSR. However, the limited availability and relatively high cost of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing represent barriers to the widespread implementation of this pharmacogenetic approach to abacavir prescribing. To facilitate routine screening, we have developed a rapid flow cytometry method for HLA-B57 phenotyping using commercially available B17 monoclonal antibodies. METHODS: Whole blood samples from 84 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients were examined by standard flow cytometry methods, using a two-colour B17-specific immunofluorescence assay in the CD45 lymphocyte population. RESULTS: All eight HLA-B57 individuals examined tested positive, while HLA-B57/58 negative individuals (n=74) tested negative for this flow cytometry test. Two non-HLA-B57 individuals showed weak cross-reactivity. CONCLUSION: In our predominantly Caucasian population, B17/CD45 dual staining was sufficient to identify individuals carrying B17 cell surface antigens. This approach, utilizing flow cytometry methods that are widely available in HIV laboratories, therefore offers a sensitive, rapid and cost-effective screening assay prior to abacavir prescription. Following risk stratification with this assay, it would be anticipated that identification of HLA-B*5701 using molecular HLA typing methods would be required in <10% of the screened population."

OBJECTIVE: : We sought to determine all-cause mortality in fiscal year 2001 (FY01) after statin initiation in FY 99 and/or FY00 in individuals with diabetes in the Veterans Healthcare Administration (VHA). METHODS: Using a retrospective longitudinal cohort analysis, we analyzed 201,102 veterans with diabetes from 104 VHA facilities with medical, pharmacy, and laboratory information from VHA and Medicare databases. Patients with statin exposure, defined as having medication possession coverage >50% of eligible days in FY99 and/or FY00, were characterized as initiators if no statin prescription was found in FY98. Otherwise, they were characterized as continuing users. We defined 4 statin exposure groups: FY99 only, FY00 only, both FY99 and 00, and neither year. All-cause mortality was determined in FY01. Propensity score matched comparisons were used to corroborate results from mixed effects logistic models. RESULTS: FY01 mortality was no different between FY99-only initiators and the nonexposure group (odds ratio [OR] = 1.08, P = 0.429). In contrast, FY00-only and FY99-00 initiator groups showed odds ratio of 0.75 (P < 0.0001) and 0.71 (P < 0.0001), respectively. There was a similar benefit for continuing users. Propensity analysis demonstrated consistent findings. Increased statin adherence from >50% to >75% was associated with increased benefit (OR = 0.71, P < 0.0001 versus OR = 0.62, P = 0.0002).

It is unclear how operons have become abundant in nematode genomes. The \"one-way street\" hypothesis asserts that once formed by chance, operons are very difficult to break, because the breakage would leave downstream genes in an operon without a promoter, and hence, unexpressed. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the presence and absence of C. elegans operons in Caenorhabditis briggsae, Caenorhabditis remanei, and Caenorhabditis brenneri, using Pristionchus pacificus and Brugia malayi as outgroups, and identified numerous operon gains and losses. Coupled with experimental examination of trans-splicing patterns, our comparative genomic analysis revealed diverse molecular mechanisms of operon losses, including inversion, insertion, and relocation, but the presence of internal promoters was not found to facilitate operon losses. In several cases, the data allowed inference of mechanisms by which downstream genes are expressed after operon breakage. We found that the rate of operon gain is approximately 3.3 times that of operon loss. Thus, the evolutionary dynamics of nematode operons is better described as \"easy come, slow go,\" rather than a \"one-way street.\" Based on a mathematic model of operon gains and losses and additional assumptions, we projected that the number of operons in C. elegans will continue to rise by 6%-18% in future evolution before reaching equilibrium between operon gains and losses."

We demonstrate here the existence of multiple Pfh1p isoforms that localized to either nuclei or mitochondria. The catalytic activity of Pfh1p was essential in both cellular compartments. The absence of nuclear Pfh1p resulted in G(2) arrest and accumulation of DNA damage foci, a finding suggestive of an essential role in DNA replication.

The absence of mitochondrial Pfh1p caused rapid depletion of mitochondrial DNA. Despite localization to nuclei and mitochondria in S. pombe, neither of the S. cerevisiae homologs, nor human PIF1, suppressed the lethality of pfh1Delta cells.

Its lifespan can be prolonged by human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). However, the signal mechanisms of this phenomenon remain unclear. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to investigate the molecular mechanisms of hCG in the maintenance of the viability of granulosa-lutein cells. DESIGN: Granulosa-lutein cells were obtained from women undergoing in vitro fertilization. We examined the effects of hCG on the survival of cultured granulosa-lutein cells. The signal pathway inducing antiapoptotic protein was investigated. RESULTS: hCG enhanced viability of granulosa-lutein cells through antiapoptosis but not proliferation, because the apoptotic marker of annexin V was decreased, but the proliferative markers of Ki67 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen were not increased. Myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) protein, but not B-cell lymphoma protein-2 or B-cell lymphoma protein-xL, was significantly induced by hCG and LH. The granulosa-lutein cells secreted vascular endothelial growth factor that induced endothelial permeability. Mcl-1 small interfering RNA increased DNA fragmentation and diminished the antiapoptotic effect of hCG. hCG induced Mcl-1 expression through the LH/hCG receptor, adenylate cyclase, protein kinase A, and cAMP response element-binding protein signal pathway. Flavopiridol inhibited Mcl-1 production, released cytochrome c, and induced apoptosis of granulosa-lutein cells. CONCLUSIONS: We first demonstrate that hCG prevents apoptosis of granulosa-lutein cells through the induction of Mcl-1 protein via the LH/hCG receptor and a cAMP response element-binding protein-dependent pathway. We may have found the molecular mechanism for luteal rescue during early pregnancy. Mcl-1 prevents apoptosis and increases cell viability but not proliferation as mechanisms for luteal rescue. Mcl-1 is a key molecule of hCG signaling."

However, the concept of \"angiocrine\" signaling, in which signals produced by endothelial cells elicit tumor cell responses distinct from vessel function, has been proposed, yet remains underinvestigated. Here, we report that angiocrine factors secreted from endothelium regulate tumor growth and motility. We found that Slit2, which is negatively regulated by endothelial EphA2 receptor, is one such tumor suppressive angiocrine factor. Slit2 activity is elevated in EphA2-deficient endothelium. Blocking Slit activity restored angiocrine-induced tumor growth/motility, whereas elevated Slit2 impaired growth/motility. To translate our findings to human cancer, we analyzed EphA2 and Slit2 expression in human cancer. EphA2 expression inversely correlated with Slit2 in the vasculature of invasive human ductal carcinoma samples. Moreover, analysis of large breast tumor data sets revealed that Slit2 correlated positively with overall and recurrence-free survival, providing clinical validation for the tumor suppressor function for Slit2 in human breast cancer. Together, these data support a novel, clinically relevant mechanism through which EphA2 represses Slit2 expression in endothelium to facilitate angiocrine-mediated tumor growth and motility by blocking a tumor suppressive signal."

IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha production were elevated after injection of IL-1beta in TTP-deficient mice. Further, embryonic fibroblasts from these mice (mouse embryonic fibroblasts) exhibited greater IL-6 mRNA expression and longer half-life than wild-type mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Overexpression of TTP reduced IL-6 3'UTR luciferase reporter activity in an ARE-dependent manner. Proximal and distal regions of the 3'UTR acted synergistically to produce the full repression of TTP. Mutation-based luciferase assays show that ARE2, ARE3, and ARE4 are required for TTP-mediated repression. The constitutively activated p38-MK2 pathway abrogated TTP-mediated repression of IL-6 3'UTR reporter activity. RNA immunoprecipitation assay indicated that the deficiency of p38alpha resulted in the increased affinity of TTP to IL-6 mRNA. Taken together, we propose that TTP downregulates IL-6 gene expression at the post-transcriptional level by targeting ARE elements in the 3'UTR region."

DITPA (3,5-diiodothyroproprionic acid) is a synthetic thyroid hormone analog with positive inotropic effects similar to thyroid hormone but with minimal systemic effects. DITPA has previously been shown to reduce pathologic remodeling and improve cardiac output following myocardial infarction; however, few studies have examined the role of DITPA in determining infarct size or the early inflammatory response following myocardial ischemia. We examined the role of DITPA in the acute phase following infarction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mice were subjected to surgical induction of myocardial infarction and were then randomized to receive daily injections of DITPA or vehicle control. After 3 d, animals were sacrificed and infarct size was determined by H and E staining. Myocardial macrophage and neutrophil accumulation was determined by immunofluorescent staining. Immunoblotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used to examine the levels of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), keratinocyte-derived chemokine (KC), monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP-1), and interleukin 6 (IL-6) in homogenates from the ischemic tissue. RESULTS: Compared with vehicle control, DITPA treated animals had smaller infarcts (52.1%+-5.7% versus 37.3%+-3.6%, P<0.05) and decreased macrophage (32+-4 versus 14+-1 cells/HPF, P<0.05, and neutrophil (14+-2 versus 7+-1 cells/HPF, P<0.05) accumulation. Myocardial ICAM-1, (2.37+-0.4 versus 1.1+-0.2, P<0.05), KC levels (33.32+-12.4 pg/mg, versus 21.24+-8.9 pg/mg, P<0.05), and IL-6 levels (112.3+-78 pg/mg versus 37.3+-25.9 pg/mg, P<0.05) were also reduced in the DITPA treated group, while MCP-1 levels were equivalent between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with DITPA attenuates the acute inflammatory response and reduces myocardial infarct size. The reduction in myocardial ICAM-1, KC, and IL-6 levels in the DITPA group was associated with a decrease in macrophage and neutrophil accumulation."

Iodine thyroid blocking (ITB) is known to reduce the risk of developing thyroid cancer. Potential adverse effects of ITB have not been systematically investigated so far. This article summarises the results of a review on adverse effects of ITB based on a systematic literature search in scientific medical databases. A meta-analysis was not performed as identified studies displayed major heterogeneity. The search resulted in 14 articles relevant to the topic, reporting mostly on surveys, ecological and intervention studies. Only one study from Poland focused on effects (both desired and adverse) of an ITB intervention following the Chernobyl accident. All other studies reported on iodine administration in a different context. Overall, the studies did not reveal severe adverse reactions to potassium iodide in the general public. Since ITB is a protective measure only applied in very specific circumstances, scientifically sound studies of adverse effects are scarce and consequently the evidence base is weak. The assessment of adverse effects of ITB relies on indirect evidence from related areas. This study may contribute to ongoing developments in pharmacoepidemiology aiming to better quantify adverse effects of medications and health care interventions including ITB."

It is now well understood that both losses and gains of DNA methylation as well as altered chromatin organization contribute significantly to cancer-associated phenotypes. More recently, new sequencing technologies have allowed the identification of driver mutations in epigenetic regulators, providing a mechanistic link between the cancer epigenome and genetic alterations. Oncogenic activating mutations are now known to occur in a number of epigenetic modifiers (i.e. IDH1/2, EZH2, DNMT3A), pinpointing epigenetic pathways that are involved in tumorigenesis. Similarly, investigations into the role of inactivating mutations in chromatin modifiers (i.e. KDM6A, CREBBP/EP300, SMARCB1) implicate many of these genes as tumor suppressors. Intriguingly, a number of neoplasms are defined by a plethora of mutations in epigenetic regulators, including renal, bladder, and adenoid cystic carcinomas. Particularly striking is the discovery of frequent histone H3.3 mutations in pediatric glioma, a particularly aggressive neoplasm that has long remained poorly understood. Cancer epigenetics is a relatively new, promising frontier with much potential for improving cancer outcomes. Already, therapies such as 5-azacytidine and decitabine have proven that targeting epigenetic alterations in cancer can lead to tangible benefits. Understanding how genetic alterations give rise to the cancer epigenome will offer new possibilities for developing better prognostic and therapeutic strategies. "

It was the aim of the present study to evaluate the efficacy of a dose-intensified GMA regimen in patients with moderately to severely active UC. A prospective open-label, single-center study was performed in 10 patients with active UC (Rachmilewitz Clinical Activity Index [CAI] >= 8 points; Rachmilewitz Endoscopic Index >= 7 points). Patients had failed to improve after treatment with steroids and/or immunomodulators. GMA was performed twice weekly for 2 h to a maximum of 10 sessions. In each GMA session, the adsorber was changed after 1 h of treatment time. Four patients achieved remission with a CAI <= 4 points. Three patients had a response with an improvement of CAI of >=3 points. Three patients showed no benefit from GMA. The quality of life score determined by the inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire-Deutschland increased by 26 points in median. First and second filters had similar efficiency in granulocyte and monocyte adsorption. No major adverse effects were observed. Dose-intensified GMA as reported in this study provided an encouraging short-term response rate of 70% in patients with moderately to severely active UC not responding to standard steroid or immunomodulator therapy.

We studied the use and outcomes of digoxin in patients in the Rivaroxaban Once Daily Oral Direct Factor Xa Inhibition Compared with Vitamin K Antagonism for Prevention of Stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation (ROCKET AF). METHODS: For this retrospective analysis, we included and classified patients from ROCKET AF on the basis of digoxin use at baseline and during the study. Patients in ROCKET AF were recruited from 45 countries and had AF and risk factors putting them at moderate-to-high risk of stroke, with or without heart failure. We used Cox proportional hazards regression models adjusted for baseline characteristics and drugs to investigate the association of digoxin with all-cause mortality, vascular death, and sudden death. ROCKET AF was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00403767. FINDINGS: In 14,171 randomly assigned patients, digoxin was used at baseline in 5239 (37%). Patients given digoxin were more likely to be female (42% vs 38%) and have a history of heart failure (73% vs 56%), diabetes (43% vs 38%), and persistent AF (88% vs 77%; p<0 0001 for each comparison). After adjustment, digoxin was associated with increased all-cause mortality (5 41 vs 4 30 events per 100 patients-years; hazard ratio 1 17; 95% CI 1 04-1 32; p=0 0093), vascular death (3 55 vs 2 69 per 100 patient-years; 1 19; 1 03-1 39, p=0 0201), and sudden death (1 68 vs 1 12 events per 100 patient-years; 1 36; 1 08-1 70, p=0 0076). INTERPRETATION: Digoxin treatment was associated with a significant increase in all-cause mortality, vascular death, and sudden death in patients with AF. This association was independent of other measured prognostic factors, and although residual confounding could account for these results, these data show the possibility of digoxin having these effects. A randomised trial of digoxin in treatment of AF patients with and without heart failure is needed. FUNDING: Janssen Research & Development and Bayer HealthCare AG."

Here, we describe a new pathway for maintaining protein homeostasis mediated by the proteasome shuttle factor UBQLN2. The 26S proteasome degrades polyubiquitylated substrates by recognizing them through stoichiometrically bound ubiquitin receptors, but substrates are also delivered by reversibly bound shuttles. We aimed to determine why these parallel delivery mechanisms exist and found that UBQLN2 acts with the HSP70-HSP110 disaggregase machinery to clear protein aggregates via the 26S proteasome. UBQLN2 recognizes client-bound HSP70 and links it to the proteasome to allow for the degradation of aggregated and misfolded proteins. We further show that this process is active in the cell nucleus, where another system for aggregate clearance, autophagy, does not act. Finally, we found that mutations in UBQLN2, which lead to neurodegeneration in humans, are defective in chaperone binding, impair aggregate clearance, and cause cognitive deficits in mice. "

        "text": "Links between DNA methylation and nucleosome occupancy in the human genome.\nBACKGROUND: DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification that is enriched in heterochromatin but depleted at active promoters and enhancers. However, the debate on whether or not DNA methylation is a reliable indicator of high nucleosome occupancy has not been settled. For example, the methylation levels of DNA flanking CTCF sites are higher in linker DNA than in nucleosomal DNA, while other studies have shown that the nucleosome core is the preferred site of methylation. In this study, we make progress toward understanding these conflicting phenomena by implementing a bioinformatics approach that combines MNase-seq and NOMe-seq data and by comprehensively profiling DNA methylation and nucleosome occupancy throughout the human genome. RESULTS: The results demonstrated that increasing methylated CpG density is correlated with nucleosome occupancy in the total genome and within nearly all subgenomic regions. Features with elevated methylated CpG density such as exons, SINE-Alu sequences, H3K36-trimethylated peaks, and methylated CpG islands are among the highest nucleosome occupied elements in the genome, while some of the lowest occupancies are displayed by unmethylated CpG islands and unmethylated transcription factor binding sites. Additionally, outside of CpG islands, the density of CpGs within nucleosomes was shown to be important for the nucleosomal location of DNA methylation with low CpG frequencies favoring linker methylation and high CpG frequencies favoring core particle methylation. Prominent exceptions to the correlations between methylated CpG density and nucleosome occupancy include CpG islands marked by H3K27me3 and CpG-poor heterochromatin marked by H3K9me3, and these modifications, along with DNA methylation, distinguish the major silencing mechanisms of the human epigenome. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, the relationship between DNA methylation and nucleosome occupancy is influenced by the density of methylated CpG dinucleotides and by other epigenomic components in chromatin."

Compared to fingolimod (ie, precursor of the S1P modulators commercially available for the treatment of relapsing-remitting [RR] multiple sclerosis [MS]), siponimod exhibits selective affinity for types 1 and 5 S1P receptor, leading to a lower risk of adverse events that are mainly induced by S1P3 receptor activation, such as bradycardia and vasoconstriction. In addition, S1P1 and S1P5 receptors are expressed by neurons and glia and could mediate a possible neuroprotective effect of the drug. A Phase II clinical trial of siponimod for RR MS showed a significant effect of the active drug compared to placebo on reducing gadolinium-enhancing lesions on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after 3 months of treatment. In a recently completed Phase III trial, treatment with siponimod was associated with a significant reduction in disability progression in secondary progressive (SP) MS patients compared to placebo.

DMD is primarily caused by whole exon deletions, resulting in a shift of the dystrophin mRNA reading frame that prevents production of functional dystrophin protein. Eteplirsen, a phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (PMO), is designed to skip exon 51, restore the reading frame, and induce production of internally shortened dystrophin in patients with mutations amenable to such treatment. OBJECTIVE: Describe lung function assessed throughout eteplirsen studies 201/202. METHODS: Studies 201/202 included 12 patients treated with eteplirsen over 5 years. Pulmonary function tests included forced vital capacity (FVC), maximum expiratory pressure (MEP), and maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP). With no long-term placebo control, FVC results were compared with data from the United Dystrophinopathy Project (UDP). MIP and MEP were compared to published natural history. RESULTS: Age-adjusted mixed-model repeated-measures analysis showed decreases of 2.3% and 2.6% annually for FVC% p and MEP% p, and an annual increase of 0.6% for MIP% p for the eteplirsen-treated cohort. Data from the UDP demonstrated a 4.1% decline in FVC% p. The published natural history reports annual declines of at least 2.7% and 3.8% for MEP% p and MIP% p, respectively, in patients with DMD. CONCLUSIONS: With eteplirsen treatment, deterioration of respiratory muscle function based on FVC% p was half of that seen in the UDP; MEP% p and MIP% p compared favorably with natural history."

We assessed the effect of siponimod, a selective sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor1,5 modulator, on disability progression in patients with SPMS. METHODS: This event-driven and exposure-driven, double-blind, phase 3 trial was done at 292 hospital clinics and specialised multiple sclerosis centres in 31 countries. Using interactive response technology to assign numbers linked to treatment arms, patients (age 18-60 years) with SPMS and an Expanded Disability Status Scale score of 3 0-6 5 were randomly assigned (2:1) to once daily oral siponimod 2 mg or placebo for up to 3 years or until the occurrence of a prespecified number of confirmed disability progression (CDP) events. The primary endpoint was time to 3-month CDP. Efficacy was assessed for the full analysis set (ie, all randomly assigned and treated patients); safety was assessed for the safety set. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01665144. FINDINGS: 1651 patients were randomly assigned between Feb 5, 2013, and June 2, 2015 (1105 to the siponimod group, and 546 to the placebo group). One patient did not sign the consent form, and five patients did not receive study drug, all of whom were in the siponimod group. 1645 patients were included in the analyses (1099 in the siponimod group and 546 in the placebo). At baseline, the mean time since first multiple sclerosis symptoms was 16 8 years (SD 8 3), and the mean time since conversion to SPMS was 3 8 years (SD 3 5); 1055 (64%) patients had not relapsed in the previous 2 years, and 918 (56%) of 1651 needed walking assistance. 903 (82%) patients receiving siponimod and 424 (78%) patients receiving placebo completed the study. 288 (26%) of 1096 patients receiving siponimod and 173 (32%) of 545 patients receiving placebo had 3-month CDP (hazard ratio 0 79, 95% CI 0 65-0 95; relative risk reduction 21%; p=0 013). Adverse events occurred in 975 (89%) of 1099 patients receiving siponimod versus 445 (82%) of 546 patients receiving placebo; serious adverse events were reported for 197 (18%) patients in the siponimod group versus 83 (15%) patients in the placebo group. Lymphopenia, increased liver transaminase concentration, bradycardia and bradyarrhythmia at treatment initiation, macular oedema, hypertension, varicella zoster reactivation, and convulsions occurred more frequently with siponimod than with placebo. Initial dose titration mitigated cardiac first-dose effects. Frequencies of infections, malignancies, and fatalities did not differ between groups. INTERPRETATION: Siponimod reduced the risk of disability progression with a safety profile similar to that of other S1P modulators and is likely to be a useful treatment for SPMS.

This complication is diagnosed in 3% of pregnant women in Kazakhstan, and it is the leading cause of pre-term deliveries. The aim of this study was to determine the outcomes of pregnancies complicated by PPROM in gestation periods between 24 to 32 weeks among three institutions in Kazakhstan. METHODS: This is descriptive analysis of 154 cases with PPROM observed between 24 to 32 weeks of gestation at Perinatal Centers #2 and #3 and the National Research Center for Maternal and Child Health, Astana, Kazakhstan. Cases were selected on the basis of retrospective chart review where PPROM diagnosis occurred in 2013. Descriptive statistics were utilized for data analysis. RESULTS: The most frequent complications associated with PPROM were threat of miscarriage (13.6% of cases) and chronic placental insufficiency (7.8%). The mean time between PPROM and onset of spontaneous labor was 12.1 +- 2.3 days. Spontaneous labor within 3 days after PPROM started in patients with an amniotic fluid index of 3.0 +- 0.2 cm. Complications experienced by PPROM women during delivery and early postpartum period included: precipitous labor (6.4%), weakness of labor activity (16.2%), atonic hemorrhage (1.2%), and chorioamnionitis (3.2%). 37.6% of newborns in this study were admitted to the Intensive Care Unit. Their health complications included pneumonia (7.7%), conjunctivitis (1.3%), omphalitis and infectious-toxic shock (3.8%), intraventricular hemorrhage (7.8%), and respiratory distress (10.3%). CONCLUSION: Thus, preterm rupture of membranes is associated with preterm delivery and an increase of neonatal morbidity. Therefore, it is necessary to find ways to effectively manage PPROM, including developing new techniques to restore the amniotic fluid volume in women experiencing PPROM during 24 to 32 weeks of gestation."

        "text": "TIMP Loss Activates Metalloproteinase-TNFalpha-DKK1 Axis To Compromise Wnt Signaling and Bone Mass.\nDeregulated proteolysis invariably underlies most human diseases including bone pathologies. Metalloproteinases constitute the largest of the five protease families, and the metzincin metalloproteinases are inhibited by the four tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase called TIMPs. We hypothesized that Timp genes are essential for skeletal homeostasis. We bred individual Timp knockout mice to generate unique mouse models, the quadruple Timp null strain (QT) as well as mice harboring only a single Timp3 allele (QT3+/- ). QT mice are grossly smaller and exhibit a dramatic reduction of trabeculae in long bones by muCT imaging with a corresponding increase in metalloproteinase activity. At the cellular level, Timp deficiency compromised differentiation markers, matrix deposition and mineralization in neonatal osteoblasts from calvariae, as well as the fibroblastic colony-forming unit (CFU-F) capacity of bone marrow-derived stromal cells. In contrast, we observed that osteoclasts were overactive in the Timp null state, consistent with the noted excessive bone resorption of QT bones. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence (IF) analyses of bone sections revealed higher Cathepsin K and RANKL signals upon Timp loss. Seeking the molecular mechanism, we identified abnormal TNFalpha bioactivity to be a central event in Timp-deficient mice. Specifically, TNFalpha triggered induction of the Wnt signaling inhibitor Dkk1 in the osteoblasts at the mRNA and protein levels, with a simultaneous increase in RANKL. Neutralizing TNFalpha antibody was capable of rescuing the induction of Dkk1 as well as RANKL. Therefore, the generation of novel Timp-deficient systems allowed us to uncover the essential and collective function of TIMP proteins in mammalian long-bone homeostasis. Moreover, our study discovers a functional TIMP/metalloproteinase-TNFalpha-Dkk1/RANKL nexus for optimal control of the bone microenvironment, which dictates coexistence of the osteoblast and osteoclast lineages.   2018 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research."

METHODS: Genome and exome sequencing were performed for five unrelated cases of IRD with no identified variant. In vitro assays were developed to validate the variants identified (fibroblast assay, induced pluripotent stem cell [iPSC] derived retinal organoids, and a dynein motility assay). RESULTS: Four novel DYNC2H1 variants (V1, g.103327020_103327021dup; V2, g.103055779A>T; V3, g.103112272C>G; V4, g.103070104A>C) and one previously reported variant (V5, g.103339363T>G) were identified. In proband 1 (V1/V2), V1 was predicted to introduce a premature termination codon (PTC), whereas V2 disrupted the exon 41 splice donor site causing incomplete skipping of exon 41. V1 and V2 impaired dynein-2 motility in vitro and perturbed IFT88 distribution within cilia. V3, homozygous in probands 2-4, is predicted to cause a PTC in a retina-predominant transcript. Analysis of retinal organoids showed that this new transcript expression increased with organoid differentiation. V4, a novel missense variant, was in trans with V5, previously associated with Jeune asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy (JATD). CONCLUSION: The DYNC2H1 variants discussed herein were either hypomorphic or affecting a retina-predominant transcript and caused nonsyndromic IRD. Dynein variants, specifically DYNC2H1 variants are reported as a cause of non syndromic IRD."

Homozygous GRN mutations cause neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis-11 (CLN11), a lysosome storage disease. PGRN is a secreted glycoprotein that can be proteolytically cleaved into seven bioactive 6 kDa granulins. However, it is unclear how deficiency of PGRN and granulins causes neurodegeneration. To gain insight into the mechanisms of FTD pathogenesis, we utilized Tandem Mass Tag isobaric labeling mass spectrometry to perform an unbiased quantitative proteomic analysis of whole-brain tissue from wild type (Grn+/+) and Grn knockout (Grn-/-) mice at 3- and 19-months of age. At 3-months lysosomal proteins (i.e. Gns, Scarb2, Hexb) are selectively increased indicating lysosomal dysfunction is an early consequence of PGRN deficiency. Additionally, proteins involved in lipid metabolism (Acly, Apoc3, Asah1, Gpld1, Ppt1, and Naaa) are decreased; suggesting lysosomal degradation of lipids may be impaired in the Grn-/- brain. Systems biology using weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) of the Grn-/- brain proteome identified 26 modules of highly co-expressed proteins. Three modules strongly correlated to Grn deficiency and were enriched with lysosomal proteins (Gpnmb, CtsD, CtsZ, and Tpp1) and inflammatory proteins (Lgals3, GFAP, CD44, S100a, and C1qa). We find that lysosomal dysregulation is exacerbated with age in the Grn-/- mouse brain leading to neuroinflammation, synaptic loss, and decreased markers of oligodendrocytes, myelin, and neurons. In particular, GPNMB and LGALS3 (galectin-3) were upregulated by microglia and elevated in FTD-GRN brain samples, indicating common pathogenic pathways are dysregulated in human FTD cases and Grn-/- mice. GPNMB levels were significantly increased in the cerebrospinal fluid of FTD-GRN patients, but not in MAPT or C9orf72 carriers, suggesting GPNMB could be a biomarker specific to FTD-GRN to monitor disease onset, progression, and drug response. Our findings support the idea that insufficiency of PGRN and granulins in humans causes neurodegeneration through lysosomal dysfunction, defects in autophagy, and neuroinflammation, which could be targeted to develop effective therapies."

        "text": "Spontaneous version after preterm prelabor rupture of membranes.\nBACKGROUND: Preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (PPROM), defined as rupture of membranes before the onset of labor at < 37 weeks' gestation, affects approximately 3% of all pregnancies. For PPROM prior to 34 weeks' gestation, in the absence of contraindications to expectant management, antibiotics are administered to increase the latency period and reduce the incidence of maternal and neonatal infection. The latency period additionally provides an opportunity for fetal presentation to change, which impacts the mode of delivery. It is important to better understand the incidence of spontaneous version after PPROM to enhance patient counseling with regard to the mode of delivery. OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence of discordant fetal presentation, resulting from spontaneous version, between admission for PPROM and time of delivery for cephalic and non-cephalic fetuses among patients diagnosed with PPROM prior to 34 weeks' gestation and to compare characteristics of those with and without discordant fetal presentation. STUDY DESIGN: We performed a retrospective cohort study of singleton pregnancies diagnosed with PPROM identified using ICD-9/10-CM codes, < 34 weeks' gestation, admitted to a tertiary care center's antepartum service from 2011-2018. Patients were included if the fetal presentation was documented by ultrasound within 48 h of admission and PPROM, and delivery occurred >24 h after PPROM. Data are presented as proportions, median (interquartile range) or risk ratio and 95% confidence interval. RESULTS: We included 209 patients. Patient age, body mass index, parity, and race/ethnicity were similar among patients with cephalic and non-cephalic fetal presentations at admission. Patients with cephalic presentation at time of PPROM presented at a later gestational age than patients with a non-cephalic presentation. Among patients with a cephalic presentation at admission, the incidence of non-cephalic presentation at delivery was 11.7% (19/162), whereas with non-cephalic presentation at admission, the incidence of cephalic presentation at delivery was 21.3% (10/47). While there was an increased risk of spontaneous version resulting in a discordant presentation at delivery with non-cephalic presentation, this relationship was attenuated and not significant when adjusted for gestational age at time of PPROM. Patients with discordant presentation presented with PPROM at an earlier gestational age and had a longer latency period compared to patients with a concordant presentation. Patient age, body mass index, amniotic fluid assessment at admission, and infant birth weight were similar in those with and without a change in fetal presentation. CONCLUSION: Discordant fetal presentation resulting from spontaneous version from cephalic to non-cephalic presentation after PPROM occurred in 11.7% (19/162) of patients, while discordant presentation from non-cephalic to cephalic presentation occurred in 21.3% (10/47) of patients. Given the limited published data on spontaneous version after PPROM these results may impact patient counseling."

However, the exact mechanism of action and the downstream mediators of curcumin's tumor suppressive effects have remained largely unknown. Here we used a genetic approach to determine the role of the p53/miR-34 pathway as mediator of the effects of curcumin. Three isogenic CRC cell lines rendered deficient for the p53, miR-34a and/or miR-34b/c genes were exposed to curcumin and subjected to cell biological analyses. siRNA-mediated inhibition and ectopic expression of NRF2, as well as Western blot, qPCR and qChIP analyses of its target genes were performed. CRC cells were i.v. injected into NOD/SCID mice and lung-metastases formation was determined by longitudinal, non-invasive imaging. In CRC cells curcumin induced apoptosis and senescence, and suppressed migration and invasion in a p53-independent manner. Curcumin activated the KEAP1/NRF2/ARE pathway by inducing ROS. Notably, curcumin induced miR-34a and miR-34b/c expression in a ROS/NRF2-dependent and p53-independent manner. NRF2 directly induced miR-34a and miR-34b/c via occupying multiple ARE motifs in their promoter regions. Curcumin reverted repression of miR-34a and miR-34b/c induced by IL6 and hypoxia. Deletion of miR-34a and miR-34b/c significantly reduced curcumin-induced apoptosis and senescence, and prevented the inhibition of migration and invasion by curcumin or ectopic NRF2. In CRC cells curcumin induced MET and prevented the formation of lung-metastases in mice in a miR-34a-dependent manner. In addition, we found that curcumin may enhance the therapeutic effects of 5-FU on CRC cells deficient for p53 and miR-34a/b/c. Activation of the KEAP1/NRF2/miR-34a/b/c axis mediates the tumor suppressive activity of curcumin and suggests a new approach for activating miR-34 genes in tumors for therapeutic purposes."

However, heterogeneity in therapeutic responses in TN-10 and other immunotherapy trials identifies gaps in understanding disease progression and treatment responses. The intestinal microbiome is a potential source of biomarkers associated with future T1D diagnosis and responses to immunotherapy. We previously reported that antibody responses to gut commensal bacteria were associated with T1D diagnosis, suggesting that certain antimicrobial immune responses may help predict disease onset. Here, we investigated anticommensal antibody (ACAb) responses against a panel of taxonomically diverse intestinal bacteria species in sera from TN-10 participants before and after teplizumab or placebo treatment. We identified IgG2 responses to three species that were associated with time to T1D diagnosis and with teplizumab treatment responses that delayed disease onset. These antibody responses link human intestinal bacteria with T1D progression, adding predictive value to known T1D risk factors. ACAb analysis provides a new approach to elucidate heterogeneity in responses to immunotherapy and identify individuals who may benefit from teplizumab, recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for delaying T1D onset."

Patients with Gitelman syndrome usually have mutations in the thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl cotransporter in the distal convoluted tubule. The location of the affected transporters correlates well with the typical presentation of these syndromes.

In the backcross population, three intervals on chromosome 1 showed significant linkage to disease, suggesting that multiple loci contribute to the production of autoimmune disease. D1Mit5 at 32.8 cM was linked to development of nephritis (chi(2) = 15.68, p = 7.5 x 10(-5)), as was D1Mit12 at 63.1 cM (chi(2) = 20.17, p = 7.1 x 10(-6)).

When p53 function is impaired, its ability to preserve genomic integrity is compromised. This may result in an increase in mutation on both a molecular and chromosomal level and contribute to the progression to a malignant phenotype. In order to study the effect of p53 function on the acquisition of mutation, in vitro and in vivo models have been developed in which both the frequency and mechanism of mutation can be analyzed. In human lymphoblastoid cells in which p53 function was impaired, both the spontaneous and induced mutant frequency increased at the autosomal thymidine kinase (TK) locus. The mutant frequency increased to a greater extent in cell lines in which p53 harbored a point mutation than in those lines in which a \"null\" mutation had been introduced by molecular targeting or by viral degradation indicating a possible \"gain-of-function\" associated with the mutant protein. Further, molecular analysis revealed that the loss of p53 function was associated with a greater tendency towards loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) within the TK gene that was due to non-homologous recombination than that found in wild-type cells. Most data obtained from the in vivo models uses the LacI reporter gene that does not efficiently detect mutation that results in LOH. However, studies that have examined the effect of p53 status on mutation in the adenine phosphoribosyl transferase (APRT) gene in transgenic mice also suggest that loss of p53 function results in an increase in mutation resulting from non-homologous recombination. The results of these studies provide clear and convincing evidence that p53 plays a role in modulating the mutant frequency and the mechanism of mutation. In addition, the types of mutation that occur within the p53 gene are also of importance in determining the mutant frequency and the pathways leading to mutation."

The consequence of these mutations on the onset of the disease remains obscure. Here, we show that RPS19 plays an essential role in biogenesis of the 40S small ribosomal subunit in human cells. Knockdown of RPS19 expression by siRNAs impairs 18S rRNA synthesis and formation of 40S subunits and induces apoptosis in HeLa cells. Pre-rRNA processing is altered, which leads to an arrest in the maturation of precursors to the 18S rRNA. Under these conditions, pre-40S particles are not exported to the cytoplasm and accumulate in the nucleoplasm of the cells in perinuclear dots. Consistently, we find that ribosome biogenesis and nucleolar organization is altered in skin fibroblasts from DBA patients bearing mutations in the RPS19 gene. In addition, maturation of the 18S rRNA is also perturbed in cells from a patient bearing no RPS19-related mutation. These results support the hypothesis that DBA is directly related to a defect in ribosome biogenesis and indicate that yet to be discovered DBA-related genes may be involved in the synthesis of the ribosomal subunits."

The p53 tumor suppressor protein is often referred to as the \"guardian of the genome\" since its response to DNA-damage or checkpoint failure gives rise to a series of anti-proliferative responses. One of the most important functions of p53 is its ability to induce apoptosis, while disruption of this route can promote tumor progression and chemo resistance. Besides its ability to promote apoptosis through transcription dependent mechanisms, p53 may also be able to activate apoptosis independent of transcriptional regulation. Therefore, to ensure normal cell growth, p53 levels and activity are tightly regulated. Upon diverse forms of cellular stress the steady state levels and transcriptional activity of p53 are considerably increased. The stabilization and activation of p53 are a result of hindered inhibition by its negative regulators, e.g. Mdmx (also known as Mdm4) and Mdm2, while on the other hand activators such as HIPK2 and DYRK2 enhance the p53 response.

However, their association has never been studied. On the other hand, DNA methylation is absent in promoters but is enriched in gene bodies. Intragenic nucleosomes and their modifications have been recently associated with RNA splicing. Because the function of intragenic DNA methylation remains unclear, I explored the possibility of its involvement in splicing regulation. RESULTS: Here I show that CpG islands were associated not only with methylation-free promoters but also with nucleosome-free promoters. Nucleosome-free regions were observed only in promoters containing a CpG island. However, the DNA sequences of CpG islands predicted the opposite pattern, implying a limitation of sequence programs for the determination of nucleosome occupancy. In contrast to the methylation-and nucleosome-free states of CpG-island promoters, exons were densely methylated at CpGs and packaged into nucleosomes. Exon-enrichment of DNA methylation was specifically found in spliced exons and in exons with weak splice sites. The enrichment patterns were less pronounced in initial exons and in non-coding exons, potentially reflecting a lower need for their splicing. I also found that nucleosomes, DNA methylation, and H3K36me3 marked the exons of transcripts with low, medium, and high gene expression levels, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Human promoters containing a CpG island tend to remain nucleosome-free as well as methylation-free. In contrast, exons demonstrate a high degree of methylation and nucleosome occupancy. Exonic DNA methylation seems to function together with exonic nucleosomes and H3K36me3 for the proper splicing of transcripts with different expression levels."

It has been shown previously that mitochondrial NADP(+)-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDPm) plays an essential role in defense against oxidative stress by supplying NADPH for antioxidant systems. This study demonstrates that curcumin decreased the activity of IDPm, both as a purified enzyme and in cultured cells. It also shows that curcumin-induced apoptosis in the colon cancer cell line HCT116 is significantly enhanced by suppression of IDPm activity. Transfection of HCT116 cells with an IDPm small interfering RNA (siRNA) markedly decreased activity of IDPm, enhancing cellular susceptibility to curcumin-induced apoptosis, as reflected by DNA fragmentation, cellular redox status, mitochondria dysfunction and modulation of apoptotic marker proteins. Together, these results suggest that application of curcumin together with IDPm siRNA may be an effective combination modality in the treatment of cancer."

METHODS: New Zealand White rabbits received either a standard diet, a 0.5% cholesterol-enriched diet only (CD), or a 0.5% CD with IVA (17 mg/kg/day) for 12 weeks. HR, left ventricular (LV) systolic function, diastolic function and LV regional myocardial performance index (MPI) were studied using echocardiography. Histological analysis included cardiac interstitial fibrosis and collagen type I fibers. Plasma levels of angiotensin II and aldosterone were quantified by immunoassays. RESULTS: IVA reduced HR by approximately 11%. IVA improved MPI and attenuated LV diastolic dysfunction (DD) (92% mild and 8% moderate DD with IVA vs. 54% mild and 46% moderate DD in CD group). IVA also reduced atrial fibrosis (p = 0.027), ventricular fibrosis (p = 0.0002) and ventricular collagen type I (p = 0.0042). IVA decreased plasma angiotensin II levels (p = 0.042), and both angiotensin II and aldosterone levels were correlated with HR (p = 0.038 and 0.008). CONCLUSION: Selective HR reduction with IVA reduces DD and cardiac fibrosis in hypercholesterolemic rabbits. These beneficial effects of IVA support testing pure HR reduction in patients with diastolic heart failure."

The 5' untranslated region (UTR) of CSFV contains the IRES, which is a highly structured element that recruits the translation machinery. The 3' UTR is usually the recognition site of the viral replicase to initiate minus-strand RNA synthesis. Adenosine-uridine rich elements (ARE) are instability determinants present in the 3' UTR of short-lived mRNAs. However, the presence of AREs in the 3' UTR of CSFV conserved in all known strains has never been reported. This study inspects a possible role of the ARE in the 3' UTR of CSFV. RESULTS: Using RNA pull-down and LC/MS/MS assays, this study identified at least 32 possible host factors derived from the cytoplasmic extracts of PK-15 cells that bind to the CSFV 3' UTR, one of which is HuR. HuR is known to bind the AREs and protect the mRNA from degradation. Using recombinant GST-HuR, this study demonstrates that HuR binds to the ARE present in the 3' UTR of CSFV in vitro and that the binding ability is conserved in strains irrespective of virulence. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified one of the CSFV 3' UTR binding proteins HuR is specifically binding to in the ARE region."

Nowadays, the new anticoagulants, such as dabigatran, rivaroxaban and apixaban, show potential advantages over classical treatments. These agents inhibit specific coagulation factors and are administered orally at fixed doses. Furthermore, heparin and vitamin K antagonists have a fast onset of action, short-duration and predictable therapeutic effects. No interactions with foods have been described, although some drug-drug interactions have been reported. At the moment, no antidotes are available. However, due to the short half-life of these agents, antidotes are less essential. The new anticoagulants are at least as effective and safe as traditional treatments in the prevention of venous thromboembolism after orthopedic surgery, as well as in the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Dabigatran and rivaroxaban have also been shown to be effective in the treatment of acute venous thromboembolism. Due to their properties, these drugs could gradually replace heparin and especially vitamin K antagonists. Hopefully, many of our patients will be able to discontinue classical anticoagulant treatment and others will never begin it."

The identification of precise paracrine signals that drive the cell-fate decision of these multipotent progenitors, and the development of novel approaches to deliver these signals in vivo, are critical steps towards unlocking their regenerative therapeutic potential. Herein, we have identified a family of human cardiac endothelial intermediates located in outflow tract of the early human fetal hearts (OFT-ECs), characterized by coexpression of Isl1 and CD144/vWF. By comparing angiocrine factors expressed by the human OFT-ECs and non-cardiac ECs, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A was identified as the most abundantly expressed factor, and clonal assays documented its ability to drive endothelial specification of human embryonic stem cell (ESC)-derived Isl1+ progenitors in a VEGF receptor-dependent manner. Human Isl1-ECs (endothelial cells differentiated from hESC-derived ISL1+ progenitors) resemble OFT-ECs in terms of expression of the cardiac endothelial progenitor- and endocardial cell-specific genes, confirming their organ specificity. To determine whether VEGF-A might serve as an in vivo cell-fate switch for human ESC-derived Isl1-ECs, we established a novel approach using chemically modified mRNA as a platform for transient, yet highly efficient expression of paracrine factors in cardiovascular progenitors. Overexpression of VEGF-A promotes not only the endothelial specification but also engraftment, proliferation and survival (reduced apoptosis) of the human Isl1+ progenitors in vivo. The large-scale derivation of cardiac-specific human Isl1-ECs from human pluripotent stem cells, coupled with the ability to drive endothelial specification, engraftment, and survival following transplantation, suggest a novel strategy for vascular regeneration in the heart."

The responsible gene and deficient protein (dystrophin) were identified in 1987, an early success of human molecular genetics and emerging genome projects. A rational approach to therapeutics is to replace dystrophin in patient muscle, thus addressing the primary biochemical defect. Fast forward 25 years, and two phase 2b/3 trials have been carried out with agents designed to induce de novo dystrophin production in DMD patient's muscle; ataluren (stop codon read through) with 174 patients, and drisapersen (exon skipping) with 186 patients. Both used a six minute walk test as the primary outcome measure. Neither drisapersen nor high dose ataluren showed any significant improvement in this outcome, whereas low dose ataluren is reported to show some possible improvement. Experience with ataluren and drisapersen has been disappointing and this is a good time to ask: What can we learn from these programs and how can this inform further drug development in DMD? At the times these two trials were started, there was a lack of existing data and infrastructure regarding both clinical and biochemical outcome measures. The recent publications of more extensive natural history data in multiple DMD cohorts, and ongoing efforts to define reliable and sensitive dystrophin assays are important. If the drisapersen and ataluren programs were instead begun today, new progress in biochemical and clinical endpoints may have triggered a re-design, with better de-risking in phase 2 studies prior to resource-intensive phase 3 trials.

However, how C/EBPalpha accomplishes these effects is unclear. Here we find that in mouse primary B cells transient C/EBPalpha expression followed by OSKM activation induces a 100-fold increase in iPS cell reprogramming efficiency, involving 95% of the population. During this conversion, pluripotency and epithelial-mesenchymal transition genes become markedly upregulated, and 60% of the cells express Oct4 within 2 days. C/EBPalpha acts as a 'path-breaker' as it transiently makes the chromatin of pluripotency genes more accessible to DNase I. C/EBPalpha also induces the expression of the dioxygenase Tet2 and promotes its translocation to the nucleus where it binds to regulatory regions of pluripotency genes that become demethylated after OSKM induction. In line with these findings, overexpression of Tet2 enhances OSKM-induced B-cell reprogramming. Because the enzyme is also required for efficient C/EBPalpha-induced immune cell conversion, our data indicate that Tet2 provides a mechanistic link between iPS cell reprogramming and B-cell transdifferentiation. The rapid iPS reprogramming approach described here should help to fully elucidate the process and has potential clinical applications. "

Enhancer signatures have been used to describe the transitions of these regulatory elements from inactive to primed and from activated to decommissioned states during development.

It possesses strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, and inhibits chemically-induced carcinogenesis in the skin, forestomach, colon, and liver. Unfortunately, the poor bioavailability and hydrophobicity of curcumin pose a major hurdle to its use as a potent anticancer agent. To circumvent some of these problems, we developed a novel, dual-core microcell formulation of curcumin. The encapsulation of curcumin in microcells increases its solubility and bioavailability, and facilitates slow release kinetics over extended periods. Besides being safe, these formulations do not bear any toxicity constraints, as revealed by in vitro and in vivo studies. Histopathological analysis revealed that curcumin-bearing microcells helped in regression of hepatocellular carcinoma and the maintenance of cellular architecture in liver tissue. Free curcumin had a very mild effect on cancer suppression. Empty (sham) microcells and microparticles failed to inhibit cancer cells. The novel curcumin formulation was found to suppress hepatocellular carcinoma efficiently in Swiss albino mice. "

However, unlike the solely inhibitory effect on Wnt signaling, the effects of DKK1 overexpression on anthrax toxicity were bidirectional, depending on its endogenous expression and cell context. Fluorescence microscopy and biochemical analyses showed that DKK1 facilitates internalization of anthrax toxins and their receptors, an event mediated by DKK1-LRP6-Kremen2 complex. Monoclonal antibodies against DKK1 provided dose-dependent protection to macrophages from killing by anthrax lethal toxin (LT).

We assessed the relative effects of rivaroxaban versus warfarin at the level of trial center TTR (cTTR) since such analysis preserves randomized comparisons. METHODS AND RESULTS: TTR was calculated using the Rosendaal method, without exclusion of international normalized ratio (INR) values performed during warfarin initiation. Measurements during warfarin interruptions >7 days were excluded. INRs were performed via standardized finger-stick point-of-care devices at least every 4 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint (stroke or non-central nervous system embolism) was examined by quartiles of cTTR and by cTTR as a continuous function. Centers with the highest cTTRs by quartile had lower-risk patients as reflected by lower CHADS2 scores (P<0.0001) and a lower prevalence of prior stroke or transient ischemic attack (P<0.0001). Sites with higher cTTR were predominantly from North America and Western Europe. The treatment effect of rivaroxaban versus warfarin on the primary endpoint was consistent across a wide range of cTTRs (P value for interaction=0.71). The hazard of major and non-major clinically relevant bleeding increased with cTTR (P for interaction=0.001), however, the estimated reduction by rivaroxaban compared with warfarin in the hazard of intracranial hemorrhage was preserved across a wide range of threshold cTTR values. CONCLUSIONS: The treatment effect of rivaroxaban compared with warfarin for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism is consistent regardless of cTTR."

These cancers are deficient in glucocorticoid receptor (GR) expression, and therefore, resistant to glucocorticoids. Overexpression of the GR both in vivo and in vitro leads to apoptotic cell death suggesting that loss of GR is favorable for cancer growth. Indeed, the GR promoter is silenced in SCLC cells by methylation. We now show that treatment of the SCLC cell line (DMS79) cells with the demethylating agent, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza), results in significant endogenous re-expression of both GRalpha and the ligand-independent GR-P. The GR gene has a complex promoter region comprising nine alternative promoters, the proximal seven of which lie within a CpG island. The endogenous re-expression seen is attributed to the constitutive promoters 1B and 1C and 1J but predominantly 1F, which we show to be heavily methylated in SCLC cells. Flow cytometric analysis using the apoptotic marker, Annexin V, shows that this endogenous re-expression is sufficient to drive the SCLC cells to apoptosis. Apoptotic induction is specific to GR re-expression as cotreatment with 5-aza and the GR antagonist, RU486 prevented apoptosis. Of the three functional GR domains (the DNA binding domain, ligand binding domain, and transactivation domain), we identified that the transactivation domain is essential for apoptosis in SCLC. The discovery that endogenous re-expression of the GR in SCLC cells is sufficient to induce apoptotic cell death by reversing a cancer-driven DNA methylation effect may lead to the development of novel adjunct therapies."

In this study, we directly compared the electropharmacological profiles of fingolimod with those of siponimod, a modulator of sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor subtype 1 and 5, using in vivo guinea-pig model and in vitro human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) assay to better understand the onset mechanisms of the clinically observed adverse events.

The high doses of fingolimod and siponimod induced atrioventricular conduction block, whereas the low dose of siponimod prolonged PR interval, which was not observed by that of fingolimod. The high dose of fingolimod prolonged QT interval, which was not observed by either dose of siponimod. Meanwhile, fingolimod significantly inhibited hERG current, which was not observed by siponimod. These results suggest that S1P receptor subtype 1 in the heart could be one of the candidates for fingolimod- and siponimod-induced atrioventricular conduction block since S1P receptor subtype 5 is localized at the brain, and that direct IKr inhibition may play a key role in fingolimod-induced QT-interval prolongation."

When TFs are bound to active regulatory regions, they displace canonical nucleosomes, making these regions biochemically detectable as nucleosome-depleted regions or accessible/open chromatin. Here we ask whether open chromatin profiling can be used to identify the entire repertoire of active promoters and enhancers underlying tissue-specific gene expression during normal development and oncogenesis in vivo. To this end, we first compare two different approaches to detect open chromatin in vivo using the Drosophila eye primordium as a model system: FAIRE-seq, based on physical separation of open versus closed chromatin; and ATAC-seq, based on preferential integration of a transposon into open chromatin. We find that both methods reproducibly capture the tissue-specific chromatin activity of regulatory regions, including promoters, enhancers, and insulators. Using both techniques, we screened for regulatory regions that become ectopically active during Ras-dependent oncogenesis, and identified 3778 regions that become (over-)activated during tumor development. Next, we applied motif discovery to search for candidate transcription factors that could bind these regions and identified AP-1 and Stat92E as key regulators. We validated the importance of Stat92E in the development of the tumors by introducing a loss of function Stat92E mutant, which was sufficient to rescue the tumor phenotype. Additionally we tested if the predicted Stat92E responsive regulatory regions are genuine, using ectopic induction of JAK/STAT signaling in developing eye discs, and observed that similar chromatin changes indeed occurred. Finally, we determine that these are functionally significant regulatory changes, as nearby target genes are up- or down-regulated. In conclusion, we show that FAIRE-seq and ATAC-seq based open chromatin profiling, combined with motif discovery, is a straightforward approach to identify functional genomic regulatory regions, master regulators, and gene regulatory networks controlling complex in vivo processes.

NCL and FTD are characterized by lysosome dysfunction and neurodegeneration, indicating PGRN is important for lysosome homeostasis in the brain. PGRN is trafficked to the lysosome where its functional role is unknown. PGRN can be cleaved into seven 6-kDa proteins called granulins (GRNs); however, little is known about how GRNs are produced or if levels of GRNs are altered in FTD-GRN mutation carriers. Here, we report the identification and characterization of antibodies that reliably detect several human GRNs by immunoblot and immunocytochemistry. Using these tools, we find that endogenous GRNs are present within multiple cell lines and are constitutively produced. Further, extracellular PGRN is endocytosed and rapidly processed into stable GRNs within lysosomes. Processing of PGRN into GRNs is conserved between humans and mice and is modulated by sortilin expression and mediated by cysteine proteases (i.e. cathpesin L). Induced lysosome dysfunction caused by alkalizing agents or increased expression of transmembrane protein 106B (TMEM106B) inhibit processing of PGRN into GRNs. Finally, we find that multiple GRNs are haploinsufficient in primary fibroblasts and cortical brain tissue from FTD-GRN patients. Taken together, our findings raise the interesting possibility that GRNs carry out critical lysosomal functions and that loss of GRNs should be explored as an initiating factor in lysosomal dysfunction and neurodegeneration caused by GRN mutations."

This was a milestone in tumor immunology on account of the significant antitumor effect of tisagenlecleucel for the treatment of relapsed/refractory B-ALL patients. Conventional standard therapies for B-ALL have high failure rates, thus developing new therapies is crucial for patients with B-ALL. Results from clinical trials indicate that anti-CD19 CAR T-cell therapies could successfully induce high response rates in B-ALL patients. However, related toxicities, such as cytokine release syndrome and CAR T-cell-related encephalopathy syndrome, may be severe or even fatal, and the management of such toxicities is therefore vital. This review will focus on the clinical application of anti-CD19 CAR T-cell therapy in B-ALL treatment, including design features of CAR constructs, therapeutic use of tisagenlecleucel, CAR T-cell therapy clinical trials and related toxicity, and prospects for cancer immunotherapy."

Human NK cells exclusively recognize tumor-bound IgG by the FcR CD16A (FcgammaRIIIA). Unlike other NK cell activating receptors, the cell surface density of CD16A can be rapidly downregulated in a cis manner by the metalloproteinase ADAM17 following NK cell stimulation in various manners. CD16A downregulation takes place in cancer patients and this may affect the efficacy of tumor-targeting mAbs. We examined the effects of MEDI3622, a human mAb and potent ADAM17 inhibitor, on NK cell activation by antibody-bound tumor cells. MEDI3622 effectively blocked ADAM17 function in NK cells and caused a marked increase in their production of IFNgamma. This was observed for NK cells exposed to different tumor cell lines and therapeutic antibodies, and over a range of effector/target ratios. The augmented release of IFNgamma by NK cells was reversed by a function-blocking CD16A mAb. In addition, NK92 cells, a human NK cell line that lacks endogenous FcgammaRs, expressing a recombinant non-cleavable version of CD16A released significantly higher levels of IFNgamma than NK92 cells expressing equivalent levels of wildtype CD16A. Taken together, our data show that MEDI3622 enhances the release of IFNgamma by NK cells engaging antibody-bound tumor cells by blocking the shedding of CD16A. These findings support ADAM17 as a dynamic inhibitory checkpoint of the potent activating receptor CD16A, which can be targeted by MEDI3622 to potentially increase the efficacy of anti-tumor therapeutic antibodies."

This multicentric study analyzed ameloblastoma diagnosed in Nigeria among different ethnic groups. STUDY DESIGN: This retrospective study included ameloblastoma cases diagnosed from 1964 to 2017 at 10 hospitals or medical centers in Nigeria. Age, sex, tribe, and location of the ameloblastoma in the jaw were analyzed. Associations between variables were tested by using chi2 and Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: A total of 1246 ameloblastoma cases were recorded (mean patient age 32.51 +- 14.54 years; range 4-86 years; male-to-female ratio 1.2:1). Approximately 60% of ameloblastoma cases occurred in young adults (age range 18-40 years). Ninety-eight lesions were located in the maxilla and 1103 in the mandible; the posterior mandible was the most common site (31.3% on the right and 26.5% on the left, respectively), followed by the anterior (26.0%) mandible. No significant differences were noted in the distribution of ameloblastoma within the tribes with respect to age (P = .92) and sex (P = .71). CONCLUSIONS: The mandible is a common site of ameloblastoma in patients in Nigeria, and in most cases, it occurs in young adults. Early presentation, diagnosis, and treatment are important to reduce postoperative disfigurement and morbidity."

There are currently no effective therapies for FTD. While 60-70% of FTD patients are sporadic cases, the other 30-40% are heritable (familial) cases linked to mutations in several known genes. We focus here on FTD caused by mutations in the GRN gene, which encodes a secreted protein, progranulin (PGRN), that has diverse roles in regulating cell survival, immune responses, and autophagy and lysosome function in the brain. FTD-linked mutations in GRN reduce brain PGRN levels that lead to autophagy and lysosome dysfunction, TDP43 accumulation, excessive microglial activation, astrogliosis, and neuron death through still poorly understood mechanisms. PGRN insufficiency has also been linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD), and so the development of therapeutics for GRN-linked FTD that restore PGRN levels and function may have broader application for other neurodegenerative diseases. This review focuses on a strategy to increase PGRN to functional, healthy levels in the brain by identifying novel genetic and chemical modulators of neuronal PGRN levels.

Exon skipping has emerged as a promising therapy for DMD. Antisense oligonucleotides (AONs) are designed to induce the skipping of exon(s), in order to restore the reading frame, and therefore, allow for dystrophin expression. Eteplirsen and golodirsen, AONs for DMD exons 51 and 53 skipping, have been recently approved by the FDA. Viltolarsen, an AON for DMD exon 53 skipping, was approved in Japan earlier this year. Although promising, the efficacy of eteplirsen and AON sequence employed remain controversial. In addition, exon skipping faces challenges including the applicability and delivery. This article reviews and discusses exon skipping and the current advances being made in the field, on drugs, multi-exon skipping, sequence design, and applicability.

The novel coronavirus affects the respiratory system, producing symptoms such as fever, cough, dyspnea, and pneumonia. The association between COVID-19 and coagulation has been previously reported. Due to several inflammatory changes that occur in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections such as alterations in the levels of clotting factors, platelet activation leads to thrombus formation in coronary and cerebral vessels, leading to myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular accidents, respectively. Unfortunately, the progression of hypercoagulability in COVID-19 is rapid in patients with and without comorbidities. Hence, the proper monitoring of thrombotic complications in patients with COVID-19 is essential to avoid further complications.

Part 1 was a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-titration study followed by 9-week safety review. Part 2 was a 168-week, open-label evaluation of golodirsen 30 mg/kg. Part 1 primary endpoint was safety. Part 2 primary endpoints were dystrophin protein expression and 6-minute walk test (6MWT); secondary endpoints were percent predicted forced vital capacity (FVC%p) and safety. Post hoc ambulation analyses used mutation-matched external natural history controls. All patients from Part 1 (golodirsen, n = 8; placebo, n = 4) plus 13 additional patients entered Part 2; 23 completed the study. Adverse events were generally mild, nonserious, and unrelated to golodirsen, with no safety-related discontinuations or deaths. Golodirsen increased dystrophin protein (16.0-fold; P < 0.001) and exon skipping (28.9-fold; P < 0.001). At 3 years, 6MWT change from baseline was -99.0 m for golodirsen-treated patients versus -181.4 m for external controls (P = 0.067), and loss of ambulation occurred in 9% versus 26% (P = 0.21). FVC%p declined 8.4% over 3 years in golodirsen-treated patients, comparing favorably with literature-reported rates. This study provides evidence for golodirsen biologic activity and long-term safety in a declining DMD population and suggests functional benefit versus external controls.

The aim of this study was to assess a number of techniques for the quantification of apoptosis in human eosinophils cultured with or without IL-5 or GM-CSF and following staurosporine treatment. The relationship between apoptosis and necrosis in eosinophils was also determined. Eosinophils 'aged' in vitro for 48 h exhibited endonuclease DNA degradation, apoptotic morphology, increased red autofluorescence and externalisation of phosphatidylserine (PS) as assessed by binding of FITC-labelled annexin V. Annexin V-FITC binding was first detectable in eosinophils maintained at 37 degrees C for 5 h post-purification. This method proved to be the most sensitive marker of apoptosis. Morphological assessment of wet preparations of eosinophils by Kimura staining was found to be the next most-sensitive marker followed by increased red autofluorescence. The latter was a relatively insensitive method for the detection of apoptosis. At 5, 20 and 24 h of culture trypan blue exclusion indicated that eosinophil viability was high (85-90% viable cells). However, propidium iodide (PI) staining and flow cytometry revealed that, by 24 h, approximately 75% of cells had compromised membrane integrity. Eosinophils maintained in IL-5 or GM-CSF exhibited a non-apoptotic morphology and levels of annexin V-FITC binding and PI uptake similar to that of freshly isolated cells. Staurosporine (10(-5) M) treatment of eosinophils maintained in IL-5 or GM-CSF resulted in significant levels of apoptotic morphology at 2 h (23.8% +/- 6.9, p < 0.025) which was associated with negligible annexin binding. At 6 h post-staurosporine treatment significant annexin-FITC binding (38% +/- 1.5, p < 0.025) was observed compared with 93% +/- 1.2 of eosinophils displaying apoptotic morphology. Exclusion of PI demonstrated membrane integrity at all time points up to 6 h. Thus, eosinophils aged in vitro in the absence of viability-promoting cytokines exhibit evidence of both apoptosis and necrosis simultaneously. In contrast, staurosporine-treated eosinophils exhibited both membrane integrity and rapid apoptosis-associated morphological changes detected by single step Kimura staining which preceded externalisation of PS."

EXAMINATION: Intracerebral hemorrhage due to hypertension and antithrombotic therapy with ticlopidine was ruled out with cranial computed tomography. Laboratory findings on admission included thrombocytopenia (12/nl), renal insufficiency (serum creatinine 1.6 mg/dl) and LDH elevation (1,218 U/l). The hemoglobin on admission was normal. THERAPY AND CLINICAL COURSE: In the presence of rapidly declining hemoglobin values and fragmentation of red cells thrombotic-thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) was diagnosed and the patient received fresh frozen plasma. Shortly after the plasma infusion the patient's condition deteriorated rapidly showing clinical signs of an allergic shock. In the sequel of 24 to 48 hours the patient developed renal failure, severe anemia and the thrombocyte count fell to 5/nl. The patient was mechanically ventilated during the next 48 hours and needed intravenous catecholamines. Even after restoration of spontaneous respiration and cessation of pharmacological sedation the patient remained comatose. Cranial computed tomography on the fourth day after admission showed multiple infarction syndrome. The patient died on the ninth day after admission in status epilepticus which could not be stopped with pharmacological means. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of neurological symptoms, thrombocytopenia, fever, renal failure and hemolytic anemia in a patient taking ticlopidine points to a diagnosis of TTP. The high mortality of TTP can probably only be reduced by early plasmapheresis."

For function, they generally require other transcription factors as partner proteins. Sox proteins furthermore affect DNA topology and may shape the conformation of enhancer-bound multiprotein complexes as architectural proteins. Recent studies suggest that Sox proteins are tightly regulated in their expression by many signalling pathways, and that their transcriptional activity is subject to post-translational modification and sequestration mechanisms. Sox proteins are thus ideally suited to perform their many different functions as transcriptional regulators throughout mammalian development. Their unique properties also cause Sox proteins to escape detection in many standard transcription assays. In melanocytes, studies have so far focused on the Sox10 protein which functions both during melanocyte specification and at later times in the melanocyte lineage. During specification, Sox10 activates the Mitf gene as the key regulator of melanocyte development. At later stages, it ensures cell-type specific expression of melanocyte genes such as Dopachrome tautomerase. Both activities require cooperation with transcriptional partner proteins such as Pax-3, CREB and eventually Mitf. If predictions can be made from other cell lineages, further functions of Sox proteins in melanocytes may still lie ahead."

Their ability to preserve bone and soft tissue yields highly esthetic results in the long term. Increasingly, patients are demanding not only enhancements to their dental (micro) esthetics but also to their overall facial (macro) esthetics. Dynamic wrinkles (caused by hyperfunctional muscles) in the perioral, glabellar, and forehead regions can cause a patient's expressions to be misinterpreted as angry, anxious, fearful, or fatigued. An emerging treatment option to address these issues is the use of a paralyzing material such as botulinum toxin A (Botox) to decrease the appearance of the wrinkles, which yields a more esthetic and youthful facial appearance. Botox is a deadly poison that is produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum and causes muscle paralysis by inhibiting acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction. When used in areas of hyperfunctional muscles, a transient partial paralysis occurs that diminishes the appearances of wrinkles, Therefore, wrinkles not attributable to hyperfunctional muscles (e.g., wrinkles caused by aging, gravity, photodamage, trauma, and scarring) will not be amenable to treatment with the toxin. As a result, proper case selection is essential. A thorough understanding of the indications, techniques, dosages, and complications and their management is imperative to achieve a satisfactory result. This article will review the pathogenesis of facial wrinkles as well as the history, techniques, clinical controversies, and other important considerations for successful treatment of facial wrinkles with Botox."

However, the efficacy of some of its indications is still in the process of being confirmed. The objective of this study was to review the history, pharmacological properties, and clinical applications of BTX in the treatment of pain of different origins. CONTENTS: Botulinum toxin is produced by fermentation of Clostridium botulinum, a Gram-positive, anaerobic bacterium. Commercially, BTX comes in two presentations, types A and B. Botulinum toxin, a neurotoxin with high affinity for cholinergic synapses, blocks the release of acetylcholine by nerve endings without interfering with neuronal conduction of electrical signals or synthesis and storage of acetylcholine. It has been proven that BTX can selectively weaken painful muscles, interrupting the spasm-pain cycle. Several studies have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of BTX-A in the treatment of tension headaches, migraines, chronic lumbar pain, and myofascial pain. CONCLUSIONS: Botulinum toxin type A is well tolerated in the treatment of chronic pain disorders in which pharmacotherapy regimens can cause side effects. The reduction in the consumption of analgesics and length of action of 3 to 4 months per dose represent other advantages of its use. However, further studies are necessary to establish the efficacy of BTX-A in chronic pain disorders and its exact mechanism of action, as well as its potential in multifactorial treatments."

It is primarily caused by mutations in the cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2). The mechanism by which these mutations cause arrhythmia remains controversial, with discrepant findings related to the role of the RyR2 binding protein FKBP12.6. The purpose of this study was to characterize a novel RyR2 mutation identified in a kindred with clinically diagnosed CPVT. Single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis and direct DNA sequencing were used to screen the RyR2 gene for mutations. Site-directed mutagenesis was employed to introduce the mutation into the mouse RyR2 cDNA. The impact of the mutation on the interaction between RyR2 and a 12.6 kDa FK506 binding protein (FKBP12.6) was determined by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting and its effect on RyR2 function was characterized by single cell Ca(2+) imaging and [(3)H]ryanodine binding. A novel CPVT mutation, E189D, was identified. The E189D mutation does not alter the affinity of the channel for FKBP12.6, but it increases the propensity for store-overload-induced Ca(2+) release (SOICR). Furthermore, the E189D mutation enhances the basal channel activity of RyR2 and its sensitivity to activation by caffeine. The E189D RyR2 mutation is causative for CPVT and functionally increases the propensity for SOICR without altering the affinity for FKBP12.6. These observations strengthen the notion that enhanced SOICR, but not altered FKBP12.6 binding, is a common mechanism by which RyR2 mutations cause arrhythmias."

MITF promotes melanoma cell proliferation, whereas sustained supression of MITF expression leads to senescence. By combining chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to high throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) and RNA sequencing analyses, we show that MITF directly regulates a set of genes required for DNA replication, repair and mitosis. Our results reveal how loss of MITF regulates mitotic fidelity, and through defective replication and repair induces DNA damage, ultimately ending in cellular senescence. These findings reveal a lineage-specific control of DNA replication and mitosis by MITF, providing new avenues for therapeutic intervention in melanoma. The identification of MITF-binding sites and gene-regulatory networks establish a framework for understanding oncogenic basic helix-loop-helix factors such as N-myc or TFE3 in other cancers."

Animal models used in the discovery of novel treatments for obesity range from straightforward measures of food intake in lean rodents to long-term studies in animals exhibiting obesity due to the continuous access to diets high in fat. The utility of these animal models can be extended to determine, for example, that weight loss is due to fat loss and/or assess whether beneficial changes in key plasma parameters (e.g. insulin) are evident. In addition, behavioural models such as the behavioural satiety sequence can be used to confirm that a drug treatment has a selective effect on food intake. Typically, animal models have excellent predictive validity whereby drug-induced weight loss in rodents subsequently translates to weight loss in man. However, despite this, at the time of writing orlistat (Europe; USA) remains the only drug currently marketed for the treatment of obesity, with sibutramine having recently been withdrawn from sale globally due to the increased incidence of serious, non-fatal cardiovascular events. While the utility of rodent models in predicting clinical weight loss is detailed, the review also discusses whether animals can be used to predict adverse events such as those seen with recent anti-obesity drugs in the clinic."

        "text": "No one can whistle a symphony alone - how different ubiquitin linkages cooperate to orchestrate NF-kappaB activity.\nAlthough it has been known for a long time that ubiquitylation has a major role in the activation and regulation of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) pathway, recent studies have revealed that the picture is a lot more complex than originally thought. NF-kappaB and ubiquitylation initially became linked when it was recognised that lysine (K)48-linked ubiquitin chains are involved in the processing of NF-kappaB precursors and the degradation of inhibitor of kappa B (IkappaB) proteins. Soon thereafter, it was reported that K63-linked chains were involved in the assembly of IkappaB kinase (IKK)-activating complexes and required for activation of the NF-kappaB signalling pathway. Recently, the discovery that atypical ubiquitin linkages, including linear and K11 linkages, are also involved in the activation of NF-kappaB has led to the need to re-evaluate existing models of how activation of this transcription factor is initiated and regulated. It is now becoming apparent that not only the canonical types of ubiquitin chains but possibly all linkage types have to be investigated in order to fully comprehend NF-kappaB activation. This can be considered a turning point in our view of the regulation of one of the most important pathways of gene induction. Hence, in this Commentary, we summarise the information that is currently available and incorporate it into a new model of NF-kappaB activation, thereby highlighting the emerging new challenges in understanding the role of ubiquitylation in NF-kappaB activation."

Using data from eight clinical studies in healthy volunteers and patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF) or undergoing orthopaedic surgery (OS), population pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) models were developed to investigate whether the PK and PD of dabigatran differ across different populations. In both healthy volunteers (n=80) and patients (n=1,965), the PK of dabigatran was best described by a two-compartment disposition model with first-order absorption and elimination. Renal function was the only covariate shown to have a clinically relevant impact on dabigatran exposure. The patient PK model was successfully applied in predicting exposure observed in the RE-LY trial evaluating dabigatran treatment in patients with non-valvular AF. The relationship between dabigatran plasma concentrations and activated partial thromboplastin time in healthy volunteers and patients (n=762) was best described with a combination of a linear model and a maximum effect (Emax) model, consistent with previous reports. PK/PD relationships were robust across the various populations tested and were not affected by any of the covariates examined. In summary, the PK of dabigatran is sufficiently consistent to allow extrapolation of data generated in healthy volunteers to patients with AF or undergoing OS."

Feasibility and necessity of monitoring].\nTwo novel oral anticoagulants, namely the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran and the direct factor Xa inhibitor rivaroxaban, have recently been approved for treatment of atrial fibrillation. They differ in many ways from vitamin K antagonists, including rapid onset of action, shorter half-life, fewer drug-drug interactions, lack of a need for monitoring and no need for titration or dose adjustments. Commonly available global coagulation time assessments (e.g. prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time) are highly influenced by rivaroxaban and dabigatran but these assays are relatively insensitive. Ideally these anticoagulant agents would be assessable using a sensitive and standardized test with a linear dose-response curve. Optimized assays are currently under investigation and may quantify the anticoagulant effect. At present the therapeutic ranges for dose adjustment have not yet been established."

No therapy is available that improves cardiovascular outcomes. The aim of this study was to characterize myocardial function and ventricular-arterial coupling in a mouse model of diabetes and to analyse the effect of selective heart rate (HR) reduction by If-inhibition in this HFPEF-model. METHODS AND RESULTS: Control mice, diabetic mice (db/db), and db/db mice treated for 4 weeks with the If-inhibitor ivabradine (db/db-Iva) were compared. Aortic distensibility was measured by magnetic resonance imaging. Left ventricular (LV) pressure-volume analysis was performed in isolated working hearts, with biochemical and histological characterization of the cardiac and aortic phenotype. In db/db aortic stiffness and fibrosis were significantly enhanced compared with controls and were prevented by HR reduction in db/db-Iva. Left ventricular end-systolic elastance (Ees) was increased in db/db compared with controls (6.0 +- 1.3 vs. 3.4 +- 1.2 mmHg/microL, P < 0.01), whereas other contractility markers were reduced. Heart rate reduction in db/db-Iva lowered Ees (4.0 +- 1.1 mmHg/microL, P < 0.01), and improved the other contractility parameters. In db/db active relaxation was prolonged and end-diastolic capacitance was lower compared with controls (28 +- 3 vs. 48 +- 8 muL, P < 0.01). These parameters were ameliorated by HR reduction. Neither myocardial fibrosis nor hypertrophy were detected in db/db, whereas titin N2B expression was increased and phosphorylation of phospholamban was reduced both being prevented by HR reduction in db/db-Iva. CONCLUSION: In db/db, a model of HFPEF, selective HR reduction by If-inhibition improved vascular stiffness, LV contractility, and diastolic function. Therefore, If-inhibition might be a therapeutic concept for HFPEF, if confirmed in humans."

METHODS: A total of 501 patients with acute myocardial infarctions were enrolled in our study. The circulating levels of thyroid hormones and clinical parameters were assayed. The patients were categorized into either the low fT3 group or the normal fT3 group according to the fT3 level on admission. All patients underwent a follow-up for 10+-2 months for mortality from any cause and the occurrence of any adverse major cardiac events (MACE). RESULTS: There were 171 patients in the low fT3 group (fT3<3.5 pmol/L) and 330 patients in the normal fT3 group (>=3.5 pmol/L). During the follow-up period, 33 patients died (6.6%) and the overall survival rates were 86.0% and 97.3% in patients with a low fT3 level and a normal fT3 level, respectively. The rates of MACE were 66.7% and 45.5% in the patients with and those without low fT3 levels, respectively. Using a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model, the fT3 level was found to be the most important predictor of cumulative death and MACE (hazard ratio [HR] for death: 0.142, p<0.001 and HR for major adverse cardiac events: 0.748, p=0.007). A Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that those patients with low fT3 levels had higher rates of MACE and death. CONCLUSION: A low fT3 level, a common phenomenon in patients with acute myocardial infarctions, is a strong predictor of short-term and long-term poor prognoses in patients with acute myocardial infarctions."

Numerous animal models show similarities to RA in humans; some of them not only mimic the clinical phenotypes but also demonstrate the involvement of homologous genomic regions in RA. This paper compares corresponding non-MHC genomic regions identified in rodent and human genome-wide association studies (GWAS). To date, over 30 non-MHC RA-associated loci have been identified in humans, and over 100 arthritis-associated loci have been identified in rodent models of RA. The genomic regions associated with the disease are designated by the name(s) of the gene having the most frequent and consistent RA-associated SNPs or a function suggesting their involvement in inflammatory or autoimmune processes. Animal studies on rats and mice preferentially have used single sequence length polymorphism (SSLP) markers to identify disease-associated qualitative and quantitative trait loci (QTLs) in the genome of F2 hybrids of arthritis-susceptible and arthritis-resistant rodent strains. Mouse GWAS appear to be far ahead of rat studies, and significantly more mouse QTLs correspond to human RA risk alleles."

Although traditionally vitamin K antagonists have been used for this purpose, they have important limitations that interfere with their use in clinical practice. Different clinical trials have shown the benefits of new oral anticoagulants over warfarin, but patients included in the ROCKET-AF trial were found to be at a higher risk of AF-related complications. Moreover, rivaroxaban has been proven to be effective and safe in patients with AF and moderate renal dysfunction as well as in those with ischemic heart disease. Rivaroxaban is taken only once daily; this may improve medication adherence and, secondarily, it provides a higher protection and reduction in the risk of stroke.

In young children with TSC, drug-resistant epilepsy and subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs) present the most common causes of mortality and morbidity. There are also some reports on the antiepileptic and antiepileptogenic potential of mTOR inhibitors in TSC. However, the data on everolimus efficacy and safety in young children are very limited. AIMS: To show the long-term safety data and the effect of everolimus treatment on epilepsy in children under the age of 3 who received everolimus for SEGAs associated with TSC. METHODS: We present the results of everolimus treatment in 8 children under the age of 3 who participated in EXIST-1 study. Five patients presented with active, drug-resistant epilepsy at baseline. The mean follow-up is 35 months (33-38 months) and all children are still on treatment. RESULTS: In 6 out of 8 children, at least a 50% reduction in SEGA volume was observed. In 1 child with drug-resistant epilepsy, everolimus treatment resulted in cessation of seizures and in 2 other children, at least a 50% reduction in the number of seizures was noted. The incidence of adverse events (AE) was similar to that observed in older children and adults. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that everolimus is effective and safe in infants and young children with epilepsy and SEGA associated with TSC and offers a valuable treatment option."

It is not clear whether serum CysC is associated with diastolic dysfunction in patients with varying cardiac conditions with concomitant diastolic abnormalities and preserved ejection fraction (EF). The authors measured serum CysC levels in patients with cardiac diseases and examined the relationships between serum CysC levels and diastolic function. Serum CysC was measured and echocardiography was performed in 124 consecutive patients with cardiac diseases. Transmitral flow (TMF) patterns surrogating diastolic function were categorized into two groups: a normal group and an abnormal group. Serum CysC and BNP showed a significant positive correlation. There were no significant differences in serum CysC among those cardiac diseases. Seventy-eight patients with cardiac disease and preserved EF (left ventricular EF >=50%) and without renal dysfunction (estimated glomerular filtration rate >=60 mL/minute/1.73 m(2) ) were examined. Multivariate linear regression analysis demonstrated that left atrium diameter and abnormal TMF patterns were independent determinants of serum CysC. Furthermore, patients with elevated serum CysC levels had poor prognosis. Serum CysC is associated with diastolic dysfunction in patients with various cardiac diseases and preserved EF.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients randomized in the Rivaroxaban Once Daily Oral Direct Factor Xa Inhibition Compared With Vitamin K Antagonism for Prevention of Stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation (ROCKET-AF) trial (n = 14 264) were grouped by baseline AF category: paroxysmal or persistent. Multivariable adjustment was performed to compare thrombo-embolic events, bleeding, and death between groups, in high-risk subgroups, and across treatment assignment (rivaroxaban or warfarin). Of 14 062 patients, 11 548 (82%) had persistent AF and 2514 (18%) had paroxysmal AF. Patients with persistent AF were marginally older (73 vs. 72, P = 0.03), less likely female (39 vs. 45%, P < 0.0001), and more likely to have previously used vitamin K antagonists (64 vs. 56%, P < 0.0001) compared with patients with paroxysmal AF. In patients randomized to warfarin, time in therapeutic range was similar (58 vs. 57%, P = 0.94). Patients with persistent AF had higher adjusted rates of stroke or systemic embolism (2.18 vs. 1.73 events per 100-patient-years, P = 0.048) and all-cause mortality (4.78 vs. 3.52, P = 0.006).

However, little is known about the functional changes occurring in liver macrophages during NASH progression. In this study, we investigated phenotypic and functional modifications of hepatic macrophages in experimental NASH induced by feeding C57BL/6 mice with a methionine-choline deficient (MCD) diet up to 8weeks. In mice with steatohepatitis liver F4/80-positive macrophages increased in parallel with the disease progression and formed small clusters of enlarged and vacuolated cells. At immunofluorescence these cells contained lipid vesicles positive for the apoptotic cell marker Annexin V suggesting the phagocytosis of apoptotic bodies derived from dead fat-laden hepatocytes. Flow cytometry revealed that these enlarged macrophages expressed inflammatory monocyte (CD11b, Ly6C, TNF-alpha) markers. However, as compared to regular size macrophages the enlarged sub-set was characterized by an enhanced production of arginase-1 and of the anti-inflammatory mediators IL-10 and annexin A1. Similar vacuolated macrophages producing annexin A1 were also evident in liver biopsies of NASH patients. In mice with NASH, the accumulation of enlarged F4/80(+) cells paralleled with a decline in the expression of the macrophage M1 activation markers iNOS, IL-12 and CXCL10, while the levels of M2 polarization markers arginase-1 and MGL-1 were unchanged. Interestingly, the lowering of IL-12 expression mainly involved the macrophage sub-set with regular size. We conclude that during the progression of NASH fat accumulation within liver macrophages promotes the production of anti-inflammatory mediators that influence hepatic inflammatory responses."

Hyperprolactinaemia causes several symptoms such as menstrual disorders, infertility, decrease of sexual function, galactorrhea in women and gynecomasty, impotence and decrease of semen quality in men. Recent studies have presented prolactin as a homone involved in many metabolic processes. Long-term consequences of high prolactin serum concentration are related to higher risk of cardiovascular system disease, disturbances in lipid profile and immunological system. Hyperprolactiaemia causes decrease of bone mass density (BMD). High serum prolactin levels lead to increase of the risk of osteopenia or/and osteoporosis. Decrease of BMD results from hypoestrogenism induced by hyperprolactinaemia and also by the direct negative influence of prolactin on bone. Hyperprolactinaemia related to prolactinoma significantly (more than functional hyperprolactiaemia) increases the risk of osteopenia, osteoporosis and bone fractures. Important group of patients threatened by osteoporosis and bone fracture is constituted by women which use antipsychotic drugs (which induce hyperprolactinaemia). Hyperprolactinaemia diagnosed in patients should be treated as soon as possible. Hyperprolactinaemic patients should be diagnosed in the direction of osteopenia and osteoporosis.

This study addresses the requirements of each of the four CPEBs for mitotic phase transitions, with a particular focus on cytoplasmic polyadenylation and translational regulation. We demonstrate that CPEB3 is the only member dispensable for mitotic cell division, whereas the other three members, CPEB1, 2, and 4, are essential to successful mitotic cell division. Thus, CPEB1 is required for prophase entry, CPEB2 for metaphase and CPEB4 for cytokinesis.

Recent evidence suggests that statins may be associated with a higher incidence of new cases of diabetes. The aim of this review is to explore this possibility, identifying factors associated with the increase in risk and the potential diabetogenic mechanisms of statins. In addition, we evaluated if the risk of diabetes interferes with the reduction in cardiovascular risk achieved with statins. METHODS: we reviewed articles published in the Scielo and Pubmed databases, which assessed or described the association between use of statins and risk of diabetes up to June 2015. RESULTS: use of statins is associated with a small increase in the incidence of new cases of diabetes. Age, potency of statin therapy, presence of metabolic syndrome, impaired fasting blood glucose, overweight and previously altered glycated hemoglobin levels are associated with increased risk of diabetes, but there is no consensus about the possible diabetogenic mechanisms of statins. In patients candidate to hypolipemiant drug therapy, the benefit of reducing cardiovascular risk outweighs any risk increase in the incidence of diabetes. CONCLUSION: statins are associated with a small increase in incidence of diabetes in patients predisposed to glycemic alteration. However, since the benefit of cardiovascular risk reduction prevails even in this group, there is no evidence to date that this finding should change the recommendation of starting statin therapy."

We report 20 new individuals with BBSOAS, exploring the spectrum of clinical phenotypes and assessing potential genotype-phenotype correlations. METHODS: Clinical features of individuals with pathogenic NR2F1 variants were evaluated by review of medical records. The functional relevance of coding nonsynonymous NR2F1 variants was assessed with a luciferase assay measuring the impact on transcriptional activity. The effects of two start codon variants on protein expression were evaluated by western blot analysis. RESULTS: We recruited 20 individuals with novel pathogenic NR2F1 variants (seven missense variants, five translation initiation variants, two frameshifting insertions/deletions, one nonframeshifting insertion/deletion, and five whole-gene deletions). All the missense variants were found to impair transcriptional activity. In addition to visual and cognitive deficits, individuals with BBSOAS manifested hypotonia (75%), seizures (40%), autism spectrum disorder (35%), oromotor dysfunction (60%), thinning of the corpus callosum (53%), and hearing defects (20%). CONCLUSION: BBSOAS encompasses a broad range of clinical phenotypes. Functional studies help determine the severity of novel NR2F1 variants.

We report a case of maxillary ameloblastoma with development of neck and brain metastases after repeated local recurrences. Molecular analysis was performed with the aim to better characterize this neoplasm and its peculiar behaviour. METHODS: We investigated the status of tumour protein p53 (TP53), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), B-Raf proto-oncogene (BRAF) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) genes with immunohistochemical, fluorescent in situ hybridization and/or direct sequencing in order to clarify their possible role in the development of this neoplasm and the possibility of a targeted treatment. RESULTS: The histological appearance of the tumour was the same in the primary lesion, in the recurrence and in the metastases. EGFR positivity was present in the recurrence and the brain metastasis, while HER2 was negative in all samples tested. Fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis for EGFR showed disomy of neoplastic cells.

Regulation of translation of p53 mRNA is a major mode of regulation of p53 expression under genotoxic stress. The AU/U-rich element-binding protein HuR has been shown to bind to p53 mRNA 3'UTR and enhance translation in response to DNA-damaging UVC radiation. On the other hand, the microRNA miR-125b is reported to repress p53 expression and stress-induced apoptosis. Here, we show that UVC radiation causes an increase in miR-125b level in a biphasic manner, as well as nuclear cytoplasmic translocation of HuR. Binding of HuR to the p53 mRNA 3'UTR, especially at a site adjacent to the miR-125b target site, causes dissociation of the p53 mRNA from the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) and inhibits the miR-125b-mediated translation repression of p53. HuR prevents the oncogenic effect of miR-125b by reversing the decrease in apoptosis and increase in cell proliferation caused by the overexpression of miR-125b. The antagonistic interplay between miR-125b and HuR might play an important role in fine-tuning p53 gene expression at the post-transcriptional level, and thereby regulate the cellular response to genotoxic stress."

Importantly, companion homologous recombination deficiency scores are being developed to help guide the selection of patients most likely to gain clinical benefit from PARP inhibition. Olaparib, the first and most extensively investigated PARP inhibitor, is now licensed in Europe for maintenance treatment of patients with platinum-sensitive relapsed BRCA-mutated (germline or somatic) high-grade serous ovarian cancer who have responded to platinum-based chemotherapy. In the United States, olaparib is licensed for treatment of patients with germline BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer who have received 3 or more lines of chemotherapy. There are a number of other PARP inhibitors in late phase clinical development in ovarian cancer including rucaparib, niraparib, veliparib, and talazoparib. This review will focus on the current evidence for PARP inhibitors in ovarian cancer and discuss ongoing clinical trials and future research directions in this rapidly evolving area."

Management of morbidities associated with PPROM is fraught with controversy. However, women should be informed of these complications. OBJECTIVE: This article aimed to review the morbidities, concordance, and predictors of PPROM over a 10-year period. METHODS: This was a retrospective review of morbidities, concordance, and predictors of PPROM among pregnant women at the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital, Enugu, Nigeria between January 1, 1999, and December 31, 2008. The morbidities, concordance, and predictors of PPROM were expressed by regression analysis output for PPROM. RESULTS: Primigravidae had the highest occurrence of PPROM. Increasing parity does not significantly influence the incidence of PPROM. The concordance and predictors of PPROM are maternal age (P < 0.000), gestational age at PROM (P < 0.000), latency period (P < 0.000), and birth weight (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: PPROM is a major complication of pregnancies and an important cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality. Management of these morbidities associated with PPROM poses a great challenge. However, women should be informed of these complications."

Trastuzumab deruxtecan (also known as DS-8201) is an antibody-drug conjugate comprised of a humanised antibody against HER2, a novel enzyme-cleavable linker, and a topoisomerase I inhibitor payload. We assessed its safety and tolerability in patients with advanced breast and gastric or gastro-oesophageal tumours. METHODS: This was an open-label, dose-escalation phase 1 trial done at two study sites in Japan. Eligible patients were at least 20 years old with breast or gastric or gastro-oesophageal carcinomas refractory to standard therapy regardless of HER2 status. Participants received initial intravenous doses of trastuzumab deruxtecan from 0 8 to 8 0 mg/kg and dose-limiting toxicities were assessed over a 21-day cycle; thereafter, dose reductions were implemented as needed and patients were treated once every 3 weeks until they had unacceptable toxic effects or their disease progressed. Primary endpoints included identification of safety and the maximum tolerated dose or recommended phase 2 dosing and were analysed in all participants who received at least one dose of study drug. The dose-escalation study is the first part of a two-part study with the second dose-expansion part ongoing and enrolling patients as of July 8, 2017, in Japan and the USA. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02564900. FINDINGS: Between Aug 28, 2015, and Aug 26, 2016, 24 patients were enrolled and received trastuzumab deruxtecan (n=3 for each of 0 8, 1 6, 3 2, and 8 0 mg/kg doses; n=6 for each of 5 4 and 6 4 mg/kg). Up to the study cutoff date of Feb 1, 2017, no dose-limiting toxic effects, substantial cardiovascular toxic effects, or deaths occurred. One patient was removed from the activity analysis because they had insufficient target lesions for analysis. The most common grade 3 adverse events were decreased lymphocyte (n=3) and decreased neutrophil count (n=2); and grade 4 anaemia was reported by one patient. Three serious adverse events-febrile neutropenia, intestinal perforation, and cholangitis-were reported by one patient each. Overall, in 23 evaluable patients, including six patients with low HER2-expressing tumours, ten patients achieved an objective response (43%, 95% CI 23 2-65 5). Disease control was achieved in 21 (91%; 95% CI 72 0-98 9) of 23 patients. Median follow-up time was 6 7 months (IQR 4 4-10 2), with nine (90%) of ten responses seen at doses of 5 4 mg/kg or greater. INTERPRETATION: The maximum tolerated dose of trastuzumab deruxtecan was not reached. In this small, heavily pretreated study population, trastuzumab deruxtecan showed antitumour activity, even in low HER2-expressing tumours. Based on safety and activity, the most likely recommended phase 2 dosing is 5 4 or 6 4 mg/kg. FUNDING: Daiichi Sankyo Co, Ltd."

In this study, the immune system-activating ability of DS-8201a was assessed. DS-8201a significantly suppressed tumor growth in an immunocompetent mouse model with human HER2-expressing CT26.WT (CT26.WT-hHER2) cells. Cured immunocompetent mice rejected not only rechallenged CT26.WT-hHER2 cells, but also CT26.WT-mock cells. Splenocytes from the cured mice responded to both CT26.WT-hHER2 and CT26.WT-mock cells. Further analyses revealed that DXd upregulated CD86 expression on bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (DC) in vitro and that DS-8201a increased tumor-infiltrating DCs and upregulated their CD86 expression in vivo DS-8201a also increased tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells and enhanced PD-L1 and MHC class I expression on tumor cells. Furthermore, combination therapy with DS-8201a and anti-PD-1 antibody was more effective than either monotherapy. In conclusion, DS-8201a enhanced antitumor immunity, as evidenced by the increased expression of DC markers, augmented expression of MHC class I in tumor cells, and rejection of rechallenged tumor cells by adaptive immune cells, suggesting that DS-8201a enhanced tumor recognition by T cells. Furthermore, DS-8201a treatment benefited from combination with anti-PD-1 antibody, possibly due to increased T-cell activity and upregulated PD-L1 expression induced by DS-8201a.

Infiltration of immune cells is considered a major contributor of PHE. Recent studies suggest that immunomodulation via S1PR (sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor) modulators improve outcome in ICH. Siponimod, a selective modulator of sphingosine 1-phosphate receptors type 1 and type 5, demonstrated an excellent safety profile in a large study of patients with multiple sclerosis. Here, we investigated the impact of siponimod treatment on perihemorrhagic edema, neurological deficits, and survival in a mouse model of ICH. Methods- ICH was induced by intracranial injection of 0.075 U of bacterial collagenase in 123 mice. Mice were randomly assigned to different treatment groups: vehicle, siponimod given as a single dosage 30 minutes after the operation or given 3x for 3 consecutive days starting 30 minutes after operation. The primary outcome of our study was evolution of PHE measured by magnetic resonance-imaging on T2-maps 72 hours after ICH, secondary outcomes included evolution of PHE 24 hours after ICH, survival and neurological deficits, as well as effects on circulating blood cells and body weight. Results- Siponimod significantly reduced PHE measured by magnetic resonance imaging (P=0.021) as well as wet-dry method (P=0.04) 72 hours after ICH. Evaluation of PHE 24 hours after ICH showed a tendency toward attenuated brain edema in the low-dosage group (P=0.08). Multiple treatments with siponimod significantly improved neurological deficits measured by Garcia Score (P=0.03). Survival at day 10 was improved in mice treated with multiple dosages of siponimod (P=0.037). Mice treated with siponimod showed a reduced weight loss after ICH (P=0.036). Conclusions- Siponimod (BAF-312) attenuated PHE after ICH, increased survival, and reduced ICH-induced sensorimotor deficits in our experimental ICH-model. Findings encourage further investigation of inflammatory modulators as well as the translation of BAF-312 to a human study of ICH patients."

These tumors, commonly known as fibroids, affect women mainly during their reproductive years and are diagnosed in up to 70% of white women and more than 80% of women of African ancestry during their lifetime. This disease has a profound impact on health care delivery and costs worldwide. Though most women with fibroids are asymptomatic, approximately 30% of them will present with severe symptoms which can include abnormal uterine bleeding, anemia, pelvic pain and pressure, back pain, urinary frequency, constipation, or infertility, and will require intervention. Furthermore, fibroids have been associated with poor obstetrical outcomes. The current options for symptomatic fibroid treatment include expectant, medical, and surgical management, and interventional radiology procedures. This article reviews the recent progress and available management strategies for uterine fibroids and highlights areas where further research is needed to find new therapeutic targets and better personalize treatments."

Accurately differentiating between breast cancer sub-types is an important part of clinical decision-making. Although this problem has been addressed using machine learning methods in the past, there remains unexplained heterogeneity within the established sub-types that cannot be resolved by the commonly used classification algorithms. METHODS: In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning architecture, called DeepTRIAGE (Deep learning for the TRactable Individualised Analysis of Gene Expression), which uses an attention mechanism to obtain personalised biomarker scores that describe how important each gene is in predicting the cancer sub-type for each sample. We then perform a principal component analysis of these biomarker scores to visualise the sample heterogeneity, and use a linear model to test whether the major principal axes associate with known clinical phenotypes. RESULTS: Our model not only classifies cancer sub-types with good accuracy, but simultaneously assigns each patient their own set of interpretable and individualised biomarker scores. These personalised scores describe how important each feature is in the classification of any patient, and can be analysed post-hoc to generate new hypotheses about latent heterogeneity. CONCLUSIONS: We apply the DeepTRIAGE framework to classify the gene expression signatures of luminal A and luminal B breast cancer sub-types, and illustrate its use for genes as well as the GO and KEGG gene sets. Using DeepTRIAGE, we calculate personalised biomarker scores that describe the most important features for classifying an individual patient as luminal A or luminal B. In doing so, DeepTRIAGE simultaneously reveals heterogeneity within the luminal A biomarker scores that significantly associate with tumour stage, placing all luminal samples along a continuum of severity."

This increased our interest in finding potential small molecule inhibitors with anticancer activity to treat K-Ras-driven cancers. We utilized integrated bioinformatic strategies, such as XP docking, MM-GBSA, cell-line cytotoxicity prediction, ADMET, and molecular simulation, to discover potential inhibitors of G12C and G12D mutants compared to sotorasib, which is a recent FDA-approved inhibitor of G12C. We identified compounds, such as flupentixol, amlodipine, and fluvoxamine, for the G12C mutant and paroxetine, flupentixol, and zuclopenthixol for the G12D mutant with significant inhibitory functions. All five compounds bound to the H95 cryptic groove of mutant K-Ras with high efficiency and, like sotorasib, retained a novel binding mechanism with additional hydrophobic interactions at the molecular level. Furthermore, the simulation studies suggested that the binding of flupentixol and amlodipine to G12C stabilizes switch I and switch II. In contrast, paroxetine and flupentixol to G12D showed a similar trend compared to sotorasib complexes. Thus, despite the very dynamic functionality of K-Ras switches I and II, the binding of shortlisted compounds is highly stable. Therefore, the reported study provides potential drug candidates for K-Ras inhibition that can be further developed with in vitro and in vivo evidence for targeted therapy."

The lack of an accurate diagnostic test has a negative impact on child's care, limiting the ability of early diagnosis and appropriate management of children. This, on the one hand, may lead to delayed recognition of sepsis and severe bacterial infections, which still represent the leading causes of child morbidity and mortality. On the other hand, this may lead to overuse of empiric antibiotic therapies, particularly for specific subgroups of patients, such as infants younger than 90 days of life or neutropenic patients. This approach has an adverse effect on costs, antibiotic resistance, and pediatric microbiota. Transcript host-RNA signatures are a new tool used to differentiate viral from bacterial infections by analyzing the transcriptional biosignatures of RNA in host leukocytes. In this systematic review, we evaluate the efficacy and the possible application of this new diagnostic method in febrile children, along with challenges in its implementation. Our review support the growing evidence that the application of these new tools can improve the characterization of the spectrum of bacterial and viral infections and optimize the use of antibiotics in children. IMPACT: Transcript host RNA signatures may allow to better characterize the spectrum of viral, bacterial, and inflammatory illnesses in febrile children and can be used with traditional diagnostic methods to determine if and when to start antibiotic therapy. This is the first review on the use of transcript RNA signatures in febrile children to distinguish viral from bacterial infections. Our review identified a wide variability of target populations and gold standards used to define sepsis and SBIs, limiting the generalization of our findings."

Nearly one-third of women with fibroid in the uterus seek medical help. The goal of this analysis is for a better understanding of the mechanisms that relate fibroids to these symptoms and to assess several treatment options, including the application of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist. We compiled the commonest as well as appropriate studies on the most common symptom of fibroids, as well as medicinal and surgical treatment options. Those who said they used GnRH antagonists orally were probed further. The underlying mechanisms myoma-caused menorrhagia as well as sterility were examined since those have been critical to understand the detailed mechanism as well as the targeted treatment modality. New treatments are determined by the amount, dimension cum localization of fibroids, and the women's age and also her choice on future childbirth. Myomas have considerable economic consequences with respect to direct expenditure, wage losses, as well as difficulties. In this context, medical, surgical, and nonsurgical techniques were examined. The novelty applied in this research article is the implementation of the GnRH antagonist-based methodology for the removal of fibroids in the uterine layer. The methodology is superior to the existing techniques for the treatment of fibroids in the uterine membrane. Novel medical techniques including GnRH antagonists were investigated and proved to be a viable new option. Alternatives to surgical-surgical modalities are desperately needed, specifically for those who are looking forward for future childbirth. GnRH antagonists have been shown to effectively alleviate the symptoms of fibroids and welcome new techniques for myoma treatment."

Recent breakthroughs in the development of mutant-specific KRAS inhibitors include the FDA approved drug Lumakras (Sotorasib, AMG510) for KRAS G12C-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and MRTX1133, a promising clinical candidate for the treatment of KRAS G12D-mutated cancers. However, there are currently no FDA approved inhibitors that target KRAS mutations occurring at non-codon 12 positions. Herein, we focused on the KRAS mutant A146T, found in colorectal cancers, that exhibits a \"fast-cycling\" nucleotide mechanism as a driver for oncogenic activation. We developed a novel high throughput time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) assay that leverages the reduced nucleotide affinity of KRAS A146T. As designed, the assay is capable of detecting small molecules that act to allosterically modulate GDP affinity or directly compete with the bound nucleotide. A pilot screen was completed to demonstrate robust statistics and reproducibility followed by a primary screen using a diversity library totaling over 83,000 compounds. Compounds yielding >50% inhibition of TR-FRET signal were selected as hits for testing in dose-response format. The most promising hit, UNC10104889, was further investigated through a structure activity relationship (SAR)-by-catalog approach in an attempt to improve potency and circumvent solubility liabilities. Overall, we present the TR-FRET platform as a robust assay to screen fast-cycling KRAS mutants enabling future discovery efforts for novel chemical probes and drug candidates."

We explored the role of MITF in Uveal Melanoma (UM) using a cohort of 64 patients enucleated at the Leiden University Medical Center. We analysed the relation between MITF expression and clinical, histopathological and genetic features of UM, as well as survival. We performed differential gene expression and gene set enrichment analysis using mRNA microarray data, comparing MITF-low with MITF-high UM. MITF expression was lower in heavily pigmented UM than in lightly pigmented UM (p = 0.003), which we confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, MITF was significantly lower in UM with monosomy 3/BAP1 loss than in those with disomy 3/no BAP1 loss (p < 0.001) and with 8q gain/amplification 8q (p = 0.02). Spearman correlation analysis showed that a low MITF expression was associated with an increase in inflammatory markers, hallmark pathways involved in inflammation, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Similar to the situation in cutaneous melanoma, we propose that MITF loss in UM is related to de-differentiation to a less favourable EMT profile and inflammation."

SVCT2 (Solute Carrier Family 23 Member 2, also known as SLC23A2) is a protein that plays a role in the transport of Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid) into cells. SVCT2 plays an important role in tumor progression and metastasis, however, the molecular mechanisms of curcumin on SVCT2 have not been studied to date. Curcumin treatment inhibited proliferation and migration of cancer cells in a dose dependent manner. We found that curcumin reduced the expression of SVCT2 in cancer cells with a wild type p53, but not in those with a mutant type of p53. SVCT2 downregulation also reduced the MMP2 activity. Taken together, our results indicate that curcumin inhibited human cancer cell growth and migration by regulating SVCT2 through a downregulating p53. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of curcumin's anticancer effects and potential therapeutic strategies for the treatment of metastatic migration."

How this is achieved is poorly understood. The microphthalmia-associated transcription factor MITF is a lineage-survival oncogene that plays a crucial role in melanocyte development and melanoma. MITF suppresses invasion, reprograms metabolism and promotes both proliferation and differentiation. How MITF distinguishes between differentiation and proliferation-associated targets is unknown. Here we show that compared to many transcription factors MITF exhibits a very long residence time which is reduced by p300/CBP-mediated MITF acetylation at K206. While K206 acetylation also decreases genome-wide MITF DNA-binding affinity, it preferentially directs DNA binding away from differentiation-associated CATGTG motifs toward CACGTG elements. The results reveal an acetylation-mediated switch that suppresses differentiation and provides a mechanistic explanation of why a human K206Q MITF mutation is associated with Waardenburg syndrome."

The underlying cause is an inherited defect of sodium chloride reabsorption in the thick ascending limb of Henle. A differential diagnosis of Bartter's syndrome is Gitelman's syndrome, another hypokalemia-hypomagnesemia syndrome, which is thought to be caused by a transport defect in the distal tube. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We report 3 patients presenting with signs primarily suggestive of Bartter's syndrome, who turned out to have Gitelman's syndrome after determining the excretion of calcium in the urine. RESULTS: Two women, 36- and 55-year old, suffered from paresthesias in the hands and feet and from tetanic convulsions. The brother of the 36-year old woman presented in our hospital because of an accidentally discovered hypokalemia without any clinical symptoms. In all patients the outstanding biochemical features were hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia and moderate metabolic alcalosis. The renin and aldosterone values were inappropriately high. The most characteristic finding in the urine, besides the presence of hyperkaliuria was the diminution of calcium excretion, despite normocalcemia. CONCLUSION: The association between sodium and calcium reabsorption in the loop of Henle predicts hypercalciuria in patients with a defect in salt reabsorption in this segment, as in Bartter's syndrome. In Gitelman's syndrome the laboratory features resemble the findings in Bartter's syndrome, except for the presence of hypocalciuria. Since hypocalciuria follows also the administration of thiazide diuretics, which act in the early part of distal tube, a transport defect in this part of the tube is thought to be responsible for the electrolyte disturbances in Gitelman's syndrome. The measurement of the urinary calcium excretion in patients with an unclear hypokalemia-hypomagnesemia-syndrome allows easily the differentiation between Bartter's and Gitelman's syndrome."

A clinicopathologic and immunohistochemical study.\nSeven solitary fibrous tumors (SFTs) of the meninges are presented and their clinicopathologic features are compared with those of 64 fibrous meningiomas (FM). Patients with SFT included 5 females and 2 males age 47 to 73 years. The dura-based tumors involved the parasagittal region (1), tentorium (2), cerebellopontine angle (2), and spinal region (2). One each showed invasion of brain and of a spinal nerve root. Of four SFTs with at least 1-year follow-up, one subtotally resected example recurred. No tumors metastasized. All consisted of spindle cells disposed in fascicles between prominent, eosinophilic bands of collagen. Whorls and storiform cell arrangements were lacking. Mitoses ranged from 1 to 7/10 400 x fields. MIB-1 labeling indices ranged from 1% to 18% (mean 4%). All were PAS negative and showed strong immunoreactivity for vimentin and CD34. Of cases studied, half were estrogen and all were progesterone receptor immunopositive. The majority (72%) of FMs occurred in females and most (72%) were supratentorial. Recurrence was noted in 15%. Mitotic activity varied from 0 to 3 mitoses per 10 400 x fields (mean < 1). MIB-1 labeling indices ranged from 1% to 5% (mean 1.5%). Unlike SFT, FMs were glycogen-containing and variously exhibited a storiform pattern (13 of 20), psammoma body formation (9 of 20), and calcification of collagen (4 of 20). Immunoreactivities included vimentin (100%), focal to patchy EMA (80%), S-100 protein (80%), collagen IV (25%), and patchy, mild-to-moderate CD34 staining (60%). Of cases studied, nearly half were estrogen and all were progesterone receptor staining positive. Meningeal SFTs represent a distinct morphologic entity, the morphologic and immunohistochemical features of which differ from those of FM and suggest a histogenetic relationship to pleural SFT. Although a minority histologically appear to be low grade malignant, our limited experience suggests that they behave in a benign fashion. The classification of mesenchymal tumors affecting the central nervous system must be expanded to include SFT."

The most common form of LQTS is due to mutations in the potassium channel gene KVLQT1, but their effects on associated currents are still unknown. Different mutations in KVLQT1 cause the dominant Romano-Ward (RW) syndrome and the recessive Jervell and Lange-Nielsen (JLN) syndrome, which, in addition to cardiac abnormalities, includes congenital deafness. Co-expression of KvLQT1 with the IsK protein elicits slowly activating potassium currents resembling the cardiac Iks current. We now show that IsK not only changes the kinetics of KvLQT1 currents, but also its ion selectivity. Several mutations found in RW, including a novel mutation (D222N) in the putative channel pore, abolish channel activity and reduce the activity of wild-type KvLQT1 by a dominant-negative mechanism. By contrast, a JLN mutation truncating the carboxyterminus of the KvLQT1 channel protein abolishes channel function without having a dominant-negative effect. This fully explains the different patterns of inheritance. Further, we identified a novel splice variant of the KVLQT1 gene, but could not achieve functional expression of this nor of a previously described heart-specific isoform."

Another related disease, dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is also caused by an unstable triplet repeat and can present as SCA in late onset patients. We investigated the frequency of the SCA1, SCA2, MJD/SCA3 and DRPLA mutations in 328 Brazilian patients with SCA, belonging to 90 unrelated families with various patterns of inheritance and originating in different geographic regions of Brazil. We found mutations in 35 families (39%), 32 of them with a clear autosomal dominant inheritance. The frequency of the SCA1 mutation was 3% of all patients; and 6% in the dominantly inherited SCAs. We identified the SCA2 mutation in 6% of all families and in 9% of the families with autosomal dominant inheritance. The MJD/SCA3 mutation was detected in 30% of all patients; and in the 44% of the dominantly inherited cases. We found no DRPLA mutation. In addition, we observed variability in the frequency of the different mutations according to geographic origin of the patients, which is probably related to the distinct colonization of different parts of Brazil. These results suggest that SCA may be occasionally caused by the SCA1 and SCA2 mutations in the Brazilian population, and that the MJD/SCA3 mutation is the most common cause of dominantly inherited SCA in Brazil."

Although its precise mode of action remains elusive, studies have shown that chemopreventive action of curcumin might be due to its ability to induce apoptosis in cancer cells. Curcumin was shown to be responsible for the inhibition of AK-5 tumor (a rat histiocytoma) growth by inducing apoptosis in AK-5 tumor cells via caspase activation. This study was designed to investigate the mechanism leading to the induction of apoptosis in AK-5 tumor cells. Curcumin treatment resulted in the hyperproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (delta psi(m)) and cytochrome c release to the cytosol, with the concomitant exposure of phosphatidylserine (PS) residues on the cell surface. This study suggests redox signalling and caspase activation as the mechanisms responsible for the induction of curcumin mediated apoptosis in AK-5 tumor cells."

Spinal subdural empyema is rare and may result from hematogenous infection or spread of infection from osteomyelitis. The most common organisms in intracranial subdural empyema are anaerobic and microaerophilic streptococci, in particular those of the Streptococcus milleri group (S. milleri and Streptococcus anginosus). Staphylococcus aureus is present in a minority of cases, and multiple additional organisms, including Gram-negative organisms, such as Escherichia coli, and anaerobic organisms, such as Bacteroides, may be present. Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Staphylococcus epidermidis may be present in cases related to neurosurgical procedures, and Salmonella species have been detected in patients with advanced AIDS; multiple organisms may be present simultaneously. Spinal subdural empyemas are almost invariably caused by streptococci or by S. aureus. Subdural empyema--whether it occurs in the skull or the spinal canal--may cause rapid compression of the brain or spinal cord, and represents an extreme medical and neurosurgical emergency. The diagnostic procedure of choice for intracranial and spinal subdural empyema is MRI with gadolinium enhancement. Computed tomography scan may miss intracranial subdural empyemas detectable by MRI. Conversely, occasion spinal subdural empyemas may be detected by CT myelography where MRI is negative. Treatment in virtually all cases of intracranial or spinal subdural empyema requires prompt surgical drainage and antibiotic therapy. Pus from the empyema should always be sent for anaerobic, as well as aerobic, culture. Because intracranial subdural empyemas may contain multiple organisms, provisional antibiotic therapy of intracranial subdural empyema, where the organism is unknown, should be directed against S. aureus, microaerophilic and anaerobic streptococci, and Gram-negative organisms. Antibiotics should include 1) nafcillin, oxacillin, or vancomycin; plus 2) a third generation cephalosporin; plus 3) metronidazole. Provisional antibiotic therapy of spinal subdural empyemas should be directed against S. aureus and streptococci, and should include nafcillin, oxacillin, or vancomycin. Morbidity and mortality in intracranial and spinal subdural empyema relate directly to the delay in institution of therapy. Both conditions should, thus, be treated with great urgency."

Recent studies have shown that RPS19 expression decreases during terminal erythroid differentiation. Currently no information is available on the subcellular localization of normal RPS19 and the potential effects of various RPS19 mutations on cellular localization. In the present study, using wild-type and mutant RPS19 cDNA, we explored the subcellular distribution of normal and mutant proteins in a fibroblast cell line (Cos-7 cells). RPS19 was detected primarily in the nucleus, and more specifically in the nucleoli, where RPS19 colocalized with the nucleolar protein nucleolin. Using various N-terminal and C-terminal deletion constructs, we identified 2 nucleolar localization signals (NoSs) in RPS19: the first comprising amino acids Met1 to Arg16 in the NH2-terminus and the second comprising Gly120 to Asn142 in the COOH-terminus. Importantly, 2 mutations identified in DBA patients, Val15Phe and Gly127Gln, each of which localized to 1 of the 2 NoS, failed to localize RPS19 to the nucleolus. In addition to their mislocalization, there was a dramatic decrease in the expression of the 2 mutant proteins compared to the wild type. This decrease in protein expression was specific for the mutant RPS19, since expression of other proteins was normal. The present findings enable us to document the nucleolar localization signals in RPS19 and help define the phenotypic consequences of some mutations in RPS19 in DBA."

Novel compounds with improved immunomodulatory activity and side effect profiles are also being evaluated. These include selective cytokine inhibitory drugs (SelCIDs), with greatly improved TNF-alpha inhibitory activity, and immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) that are structural analogs of thalidomide, with improved properties. A third group recently identified within the SelCID group, with phosphodiesterase type 4-independent activity, is in the process of being characterized in laboratory studies. This review describes the emerging immunological properties of thalidomide, from a historical context to present-day clinical applications, most notably in multiple myeloma but also in other cancers, inflammatory disease, and HIV. We also describe the laboratory studies that have led to the characterization and development of SelCIDs and IMiDs into potentially clinically relevant drugs. Early trial data suggest that these novel immunomodulatory compounds may supercede thalidomide to become established therapies, particularly in certain cancers.

Differences in genetic and environmental factors might be minimized among first-degree relatives. We therefore studied clinical expression in a family with several affected members. METHODS: We studied a three-generation family with the onset of CCM as a cerebral haemorrhage in the younger (four-year-old) sibling. Identification and enumeration of CCMs were performed in T2-weighted or gradient-echo MRIs of the whole brains. Genetic analysis comprised SCCP, sequencing and restriction polymorphism of the Krit1 gene in the proband and at risk relatives. RESULTS: The phenotypes of cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs) in carriers of Krit1 mutations were very variable. We identified a novel frameshift mutation caused by a 1902A insertion in exon 17 of the Krit1 gene, which leads to a premature TAA triplet and predicts the truncating phenotype Y634X. A very striking finding was the absence of both clinical symptoms and CCMs in the eldest sibling harbouring the 1902insA. CONCLUSIONS: Patients in this family, harbouring the same mutation, illustrate the very variable clinical and radiological expression of a Krit1 mutation. The early and critical onset in the proband contrasts with minor clinical findings in affected relatives. This consideration is important in genetic counselling."

The exploration of physiologic functions of Wnt proteins in adult organisms has been hampered by functional redundancy and the necessity for conditional inactivation strategies. Dickkopf-1 (Dkk1) is a potent secreted Wnt antagonist that interacts with Wnt coreceptors of the LRP family. To address the contribution of Wnt signaling to gastrointestinal epithelial proliferation, adenoviral expression of Dkk1 was used to achieve stringent, conditional, and reversible Wnt inhibition in adult animals. Adenovirus Dkk1 (Ad Dkk1) treatment of adult mice repressed expression of the Wnt target genes CD44 and EphB2 within 2 days in both small intestine and colon, indicating an extremely broad role for Wnt signaling in the maintenance of adult gastrointestinal gene expression. In parallel, Ad Dkk1 markedly inhibited proliferation in small intestine and colon, accompanied by progressive architectural degeneration with the loss of crypts, villi, and glandular structure by 7 days. Whereas decreased Dkk1 expression at later time points (>10 days) was followed by crypt and villus regeneration, which was consistent with a reversible process, substantial mortality ensued from colitis and systemic infection. These results indicate the efficacy of systemic expression of secreted Wnt antagonists as a general strategy for conditional inactivation of Wnt signaling in adult organisms and illustrate a striking reliance on a single growth factor pathway for the maintenance of the architecture of the adult small intestine and colon."

In addition to suppression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), thalidomide effects the generation and elaboration of a cascade of pro-inflammatory cytokines that activate cytotoxic T-cells even in the absence of co-stimulatory signals. Furthermore, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and beta fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) secretion and cellular response are suppressed by thalidomide, thus antagonizing neoangiogenesis and altering the bone marrow stromal microenvironment in hematologic malignancies. The thalidomide analogs, lenalidomide (CC-5013; Revlimid) and CC-4047 (Actimid), have enhanced potency as inhibitors of TNF-alpha and other inflammatory cytokines, as well as greater capacity to promote T-cell activation and suppress angiogenesis.

Abeta imaging should allow earlier diagnosis, but clinical application is hindered by the short decay half-life of current Abeta-specific ligands. (18)F-BAY94-9172 is an Abeta ligand that, due to the half-life of (18)F, is suitable for clinical use. We thus studied the effectiveness of this ligand in identifying patients with AD. METHODS: 15 patients with mild AD, 15 healthy elderly controls, and five individuals with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) were studied. (18)F-BAY94-9172 binding was quantified by use of the standardised uptake value ratio (SUVR), which was calculated for the neocortex by use of the cerebellum as reference region. SUVR images were visually rated as normal or AD. FINDINGS: (18)F-BAY94-9172 binding matched the reported post-mortem distribution of Abeta plaques. All AD patients showed widespread neocortical binding, which was greater in the precuneus/posterior cingulate and frontal cortex than in the lateral temporal and parietal cortex. There was relative sparing of sensorimotor, occipital, and medial temporal cortex. Healthy controls and FTLD patients showed only white-matter binding, although three controls and one FTLD patient had mild uptake in frontal and precuneus cortex. At 90-120 min after injection, higher neocortical SUVR was observed in AD patients (2.0 [SD 0.3]) than in healthy controls (1.3 [SD 0.2]; p<0.0001) or FTLD patients (1.2 [SD 0.2]; p=0.009). Visual interpretation was 100% sensitive and 90% specific for detection of AD.

In addition to predicting transmembrane strands, TMBHMM also predicts the exposure status (i.e., exposed to the membrane or hidden in the protein structure) of the residues in the transmembrane region, which is a novel feature of the TMBHMM method. Furthermore, TMBHMM can also predict the membrane residues that are not part of beta barrel forming strands. The training of the TMBHMM was performed on a non-redundant data set of 19 TMBs. The self-consistency test yielded Q(2) accuracy of 0.87, Q(3) accuracy of 0.83, Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.74 and SOV for beta strand of 0.95. In this self-consistency test the method predicted 83% of transmembrane residues with correct exposure status.

DESIGN: Noninterventional retrospective case series composed of 7 patients. RESULTS: Nevus flammeus combined with ipsilateral ocular melanocytosis or melanosis was seen in all 7 patients. Additional contralateral nevus flammeus was observed in 3 patients. Nevus flammeus (unilateral in 4 patients and bilateral in 3 patients) was distributed in trigeminal nerves V1 (n = 3), V2 (n = 7), and V3 (n = 5). Related findings included diffuse choroidal hemangioma (n = 1) and glaucoma (n = 1), with no patients having brain hemangioma or seizures. Ocular pigmentary abnormalities (unilateral in all 7 patients) included congenital ocular melanocytosis (n = 6) and conjunctival acquired melanosis (n = 1). Pigmentation was sectorial (partial) in 5 patients and complete in 2 patients. Melanocytosis involved the periocular skin in 1 patient, sclera in 2 patients, iris in 2 patients, and choroid in 4 patients. In 3 of 6 patients, melanocytosis was visible in the choroid only on dilated fundus evaluation. Related tumors included choroidal melanoma (n = 3), optic disc melanocytoma (n = 1), and conjunctival melanoma in situ (primary acquired melanosis) (n = 1). Melanoma metastasis developed in 1 patient. CONCLUSIONS: Phacomatosis pigmentovascularis shows features of nevus flammeus and more serious ocular pigmentary abnormalities (uveoscleral melanocytosis and conjunctival melanosis). Melanocytosis may be detected only by dilated ocular fundus examination, as found in 3 of 6 patients. Furthermore, choroidal melanoma can develop from melanocytosis, as noted in 3 of our 6 patients (50%).

CaMKII has diverse downstream targets that promote vascular disease, heart failure, and arrhythmias, so improved understanding of CaMKII signaling has the potential to lead to new therapies for cardiovascular disease. CaMKII is a multimeric serine-threonine kinase that is initially activated by binding calcified calmodulin (Ca(2+)/CaM). Under conditions of sustained exposure to elevated Ca(2+)/CaM, CaMKII transitions into a Ca(2+)/CaM-autonomous enzyme by two distinct but parallel processes. Autophosphorylation of threonine-287 in the CaMKII regulatory domain \"traps\" CaMKII into an open configuration even after Ca(2+)/CaM unbinding. More recently, our group identified a pair of methionines (281/282) in the CaMKII regulatory domain that undergo a partially reversible oxidation which, like autophosphorylation, prevents CaMKII from inactivating after Ca(2+)/CaM unbinding. Here we review roles of CaMKII in cardiovascular disease with an eye to understanding how CaMKII may act as a transduction signal to connect pro-oxidant conditions into specific downstream pathological effects that are relevant to rare and common forms of cardiovascular disease."

Supporting such an association, recent reports have identified distinct histone methylation patterns, elevated nucleosome occupancy and enriched DNA methylation at exons relative to introns. Moreover, the rate of transcription elongation has been linked to alternative splicing. Here we provide the first evidence that a DNA-binding protein, CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), can promote inclusion of weak upstream exons by mediating local RNA polymerase II pausing both in a mammalian model system for alternative splicing, CD45, and genome-wide. We further show that CTCF binding to CD45 exon 5 is inhibited by DNA methylation, leading to reciprocal effects on exon 5 inclusion.

Based on physical principles, our method can predict structures of the TM domain of beta-barrel membrane proteins of novel topology, including those from eukaryotic mitochondria. Our method is based on a model of physical interactions, a discrete conformational state space, an empirical potential function, as well as a model to account for interstrand loop entropy. We are able to construct three-dimensional atomic structure of the TM domains from sequences for a set of 23 nonhomologous proteins (resolution 1.8-3.0 A). The median rmsd of TM domains containing 75-222 residues between predicted and measured structures is 3.9 A for main chain atoms. In addition, stability determinants and protein-protein interaction sites can be predicted. Such predictions on eukaryotic mitochondria outer membrane protein Tom40 and VDAC are confirmed by independent mutagenesis and chemical cross-linking studies. These results suggest that our model captures key components of the organization principles of beta-barrel membrane protein assembly."

        "text": "Slow calcium waves and redox changes precede mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening in the intact heart during hypoxia and reoxygenation.\nAIMS: Opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) is an important step on the pathway towards cardiomyocyte death, defining the extent of injury following cardiac ischaemia and reperfusion. In isolated mitochondria, mPTP opening is triggered by calcium overload facilitated by oxidative stress. In isolated cells, however, it has been suggested that mPTP opening occurs before calcium overload and is stimulated by oxidative stress. Our objective was to establish the events that cause mPTP opening in the intact heart. METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed multiphoton imaging of Langendorff-perfused mouse hearts expressing an inducible, Ca(2+)-sensitive reporter (circularly Permuted GFP and calmodulin (CaM), version 2), to examine the spatiotemporal relationship between [Ca(2+)](c), redox state, and mPTP opening in the intact heart during hypoxia and reoxygenation at sub-myocyte resolution. We found that during reperfusion, calcium waves propagated across multiple cells at 3.3 microm/s. mPTP opening caused an abrupt loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, measured using a potentiometric dye, which was invariably preceded by a rise in [Ca(2+)](c). The probability that localized [Ca(2+)](c) waves led to mPTP opening was greater early during reoxygenation. During reoxygenation, coordinated redox changes also occurred across large regions and preceded mPTP opening on average by 122 +- 38 s. Fewer [Ca(2+)] waves led to mPTP opening in the presence of mPTP inhibitor cyclosporin A or mitochondrial-targeted scavenger of reactive oxygen species, MitoQ. CONCLUSION: These experiments define the spatiotemporal relationship between changes in [Ca(2+)](c), redox state and mPTP opening during reoxygenation in the intact heart. Tissue oxidation coincident with localized calcium waves together conspire to cause mPTP opening and subsequent cell death."

        "text": "Bile salts increase epithelial cell proliferation through HuR-induced c-Myc expression.\nBACKGROUND: Bile salts increase intestinal mucosal proliferation through an increase in c-Myc, a transcription factor that controls the expression of numerous translation regulatory proteins. HuR is an RNA-binding protein that regulates translation of target mRNAs. RNA-binding proteins can control mRNA stability by binding to AU- and U-rich elements located in the 3'-untranslated regions (3'-UTRs) of target mRNAs. AIM: To determine how bile salt-induced c-Myc stimulates enterocyte proliferation. METHODS: Enterocyte proliferation was measured both in vivo using C57Bl6 mice and in vitro using IEC-6 cells after taurodeoxycholate (TDCA) supplementation. HuR and c-Myc protein expression was determined by immunoblot. c-Myc mRNA expression was determined by PCR. HuR expression was inhibited using specific small interfering RNA. HuR binding to c-Myc mRNA was determined by immunoprecipitation. RESULTS: TDCA increased enterocyte proliferation in vivo and in vitro. TDCA stimulates translocation of HuR from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Cytoplasmic HuR regulates c-Myc translation by HuR binding to the 3'-UTR of c-Myc mRNA. Increased TDCA-induced c-Myc increases enterocyte proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: Bile salts have beneficial effects on the intestinal epithelial mucosa, which are important in maintaining intestinal mucosal integrity and function. These data further support an important beneficial role of bile salts in regulation of mucosal growth and repair. Decreased enterocyte exposure to luminal bile salts, as occurs during critical illness, liver failure, starvation, and intestinal injury, may have a detrimental effect on mucosal integrity."

        "text": "Intelligent bioengineering in vitiligo treatment: transdermal protein transduction of melanocyte-lineage-specific genes.\nVitiligo is a common, incurable skin disease with a prevalence of about 1%. Although many vitiligo therapies are available in clinics, there is almost no one method that causes significant improvement in all vitiligo patients. Some have hypothesized that melanocyte dysfunction or deficiency underlies the loss of skin pigmentation observed in vitiligo. The autoimmune-mediated apoptosis of melanocytes might be an important part of the etiology of vitiligo, which prevents the formation of melanocytes in the skin. Here we propose a novel hypothesis for vitiligo treatment using in situ melanocyte regeneration induced by melanocyte-lineage-specific genes (MLSGs). This may serve as an intelligent bioengineering prototype. The hypothesis is based on the fact that MLSGs regulate melanocyte differentiation through epigenetic reprogramming, which includes microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), paired box 3 (PAX3), and Notch signaling. MITF directs the terminal differentiation of melanocytes, and PAX3 helps to establish the properties of the melanocyte stem cells. Notch signaling promotes adult stem cell proliferation and self-renewal. This process could be mimicked by Notch intracellular domain (NICD). MLSGs could also stimulate anti-apoptotic gene expression. Recent improvements in relevant biotechniques allow the transdermal delivery of MLSG proteins into the patient, where they enter cells through protein transduction. This process may promote melanocyte regeneration in situ with little impact on the hair follicular cycle or on carcinogenesis. This simple and efficient treatment may have significant impact on the treatment of vitiligo patients."

TSC is caused by the loss of either the TSC1 or TSC2 genes that normally regulate the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase. mTOR exists within two distinct complexes, mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2). Loss of either TSC gene leads to increased mTORC1 but decreased mTORC2 signaling. As the contribution of decreased mTORC2 signaling to neural development and homeostasis has not been well studied, we generated a conditional knockout (CKO) of Rictor, a key component of mTORC2. mTORC2 signaling is impaired in the brain, whereas mTORC1 signaling is unchanged. Rictor CKO mice have small brains and bodies, normal lifespan and are fertile. Cortical layering is normal, but neurons are smaller than those in control brains. Seizures were not observed, although excessive slow activity was seen on electroencephalography. Rictor CKO mice are hyperactive and have reduced anxiety-like behavior. Finally, there is decreased white matter and increased levels of monoamine neurotransmitters in the cerebral cortex. Loss of mTORC2 signaling in the cortex independent of mTORC1 can disrupt normal brain development and function and may contribute to some of the neurologic manifestations seen in TSC."

In studies in vitro, SNRIs have been reported to show a large variability in the affinity ratio between SERT and NET. For instance, the reported affinity ratio is about 30 for venlafaxine and 1.6 for milnacipran. In this study in nonhuman primates, we aimed to investigate the relationship between SERT and NET affinity by measuring the in vivo occupancy at both transporters of venlafaxine and milnacipran. METHODS: PET measurements with [(11)C]MADAM and [(18)F]FMeNER-D(2) were performed in two female cynomolgus monkeys at baseline and after pretreatment with venlafaxine and milnacipran, respectively. Relationships between dose, plasma concentration, and transporter occupancy were evaluated by saturation analysis using a hyperbolic function. Binding affinity (Kd(plasma)) was expressed by the dose or plasma concentration at which 50 % of the transporter was occupied. RESULTS: SERT and NET occupancy by venlafaxine and milnacipran increased in a dose and plasma concentration-dependent manner. The Kd(plasma) ratio of SERT to NET was 1.9 for venlafaxine and 0.6 for milnacipran. CONCLUSIONS: In this nonhuman primate PET study, the affinity in vivo for SERT and NET, respectively, was shown to be at a similar level for venlafaxine and milnacipran. Both drugs were found to produce balanced inhibition of SERT and NET binding. This observation is not consistent with previous in vitro binding data and illustrates the need to characterize antidepressants at in vivo condition."

The predisposing factors are mostly diabetic ketoacidosis and severe immunosuppressive conditions such as prolonged neutropenia, steroid or T-cell suppressor therapy, solid organ transplantation or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Mucormycosis can also occur in immunocompetent patients, especially after trauma, burns or direct inoculation of the fungi (e.g. intravenous drug abuse). The most frequently targeted primary sites of infection are sinuses with a rapid spread to the adjacent tissues including the brain, the lower respiratory tract, the digestive tract and the skin. Mucorales are able to invade the vessels causing hematogenous dissemination, vascular thrombosis and, ultimately, necrosis of the lesions. Clinical and radiological aspects are similar to those observed in other invasive filamentous fungi infections such as invasive aspergillosis, fusariosis or scedosporiosis. CT-scan or MRI are mandatory to assess the extension of the lesions. The diagnosis remains difficult and is often delayed resulting in a poor outcome."

However, there have been episodes of major bleeding, especially in elderly patients or those with renal dysfunction. The purpose of this study was to retrospectively examine the relationship between the bleeding events and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) values under dabigatran usage in the everyday clinical practice. Moreover, we investigated which factors would contribute to the APTT values. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 139 NVAF patients (112 men, 65 +- 11 years) were included. We evaluated the influence of the putative etiological variables and the bleeding score, HAS-BLED score, on APTT values: age greater than 70 years, renal function, gender, dose of dabigatran, and the concomitant prescription of a P-glycoprotein inhibitor. There were 50 patients with an age of >= 70 years (36.0%). A P-glycoprotein inhibitor was administered in 18 patients. During the observation period (median 120 days) there was 1 episode of asymptomatic cerebral infarction. There were no intrinsic major bleeding events, however, 11 patients had minor hemorrhagic events. The results of the APTT measurements exhibited a variety of values both among inter- and intra-individuals. On multivariable analysis, significant associations were found between the following risk factors and the APTT values: creatinine clearance, dose of dabigatran, and concomitant use of a P-glycoprotein inhibitor. The minor bleeding events did not correlate with the APTT values, nor HAS-BLED score. CONCLUSIONS: The APTT values became prolonged under dabigatran usage and exhibited a remarkable diversity. Although major bleeding did not occur unless APTT was prolonged excessively, minor bleeding arose irrespective of the APTT values even within the range of the APTT values not exceeding 80s."

This study was performed to assess the levels of maternal proadrenomedullin (pro-ADM) and serum amyloid A (AA) in PPROM and its association with fetomaternal infectious morbidity. A total of 63 pregnant women, of which 43 with PPROM between 24 and 34 weeks gestation and 20 normal pregnant women without PPROM were included in the study. The study group was separated into 2 subgroups as PPROM and PPROM-histological chorioamnionitis (PPROM-HC). The blood samples were taken before the administration of any medication. The mean serum interleukin-6 (IL-6), AA, and pro-ADM values in the PPROM-HC group were significantly higher than the PPROM and control group. The cutoff values of pro-ADM and AA were determined as 4.2 nM and 69 mug/mL, respectively. Both of them showed similar sensitivity, specificity to IL-6 and a better sensitivity and specificity as compared to C-reactive protein and white blood cell count. We determined the predictive value of pro-ADM and serum AA measurements in PPROM and PPROM with histological chorioamnionitis. We suggest using pro-ADM and serum AA biomarkers for detecting the histological chorioamnionitis at an earlier stage in PPROM without any clinical signs. "

In this study, we examined the function of Fank1 by establishing a Fank1-knockdown transgenic mouse model. The apoptotic statuses of the testes of the transgenic mice were tested using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) method. The FANK1 consensus DNA-binding sequence was identified using cyclic amplification of sequence target (CAST) analysis. Differentially expressed genes were examined using microarray analysis. A reduction in sperm number and an increase in apoptotic spermatocytes were observed in Fank1-knockdown mice, and the apoptotic cells were found to be primarily spermatogonia and spermatocytes. The CAST results demonstrated that the consensus DNA-binding sequence was AAAAAG, in which the percentage occurrence of each base at each position ranged from 55 to 86%. This sequence was present in the promoter regions of 10 differentially expressed genes that were examined using microarray analysis. In total, 17 genes were differentially expressed with changes in their expression levels greater than twofold. The abnormal expression of Fank1 target genes that were regulated directly or indirectly by Fank1 reduced the number of sperm in the knockdown mice. Thus, FANK1 may play a pivotal role in spermatogenesis as a transcription factor. "

We compared the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab at doses of 2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks in patients with ipilimumab-refractory advanced melanoma. METHODS: In an open-label, international, multicentre expansion cohort of a phase 1 trial, patients (aged >=18 years) with advanced melanoma whose disease had progressed after at least two ipilimumab doses were randomly assigned with a computer-generated allocation schedule (1:1 final ratio) to intravenous pembrolizumab at 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks or 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or consent withdrawal. Primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR) assessed with the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST, version 1.1) by independent central review. Analysis was done on the full-analysis set (all treated patients with measurable disease at baseline). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01295827. FINDINGS: 173 patients received pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg (n=89) or 10 mg/kg (n=84). Median follow-up duration was 8 months. ORR was 26% at both doses--21 of 81 patients in the 2 mg/kg group and 20 of 76 in the 10 mg/kg group (difference 0%, 95% CI -14 to 13; p=0 96). Treatment was well tolerated, with similar safety profiles in the 2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg groups and no drug-related deaths. The most common drug-related adverse events of any grade in the 2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg groups were fatigue (29 [33%] vs 31 [37%]), pruritus (23 [26%] vs 16 [19%]), and rash (16 [18%] vs 15 [18%]). Grade 3 fatigue, reported in five (3%) patients in the 2 mg/kg pembrolizumab group, was the only drug-related grade 3 to 4 adverse event reported in more than one patient. INTERPRETATION: The results suggest that pembrolizumab at a dose of 2 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks might be an effective treatment in patients for whom there are few effective treatment options.

Our aim was to develop a tracer to better quantify the penetration of BAF312 in the human brain, with the potential to be labeled for positron emission tomography (PET) or single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Although the PET radioisotopes (11)C and (18)F could have been introduced in BAF312 without modifying its structure, they do not have decay kinetics compatible with the time required for observing the drug's organ distribution in patients.

However, the transcriptional activity of FOXP2 regulated by the post-translational modifications remains unknown. Here, we demonstrated that FOXP2 is clearly defined as a SUMO target protein at the cellular levels as FOXP2 is covalently modified by both SUMO1 and SUMO3. Furthermore, SUMOylation of FOXP2 was significantly decreased by SENP2 (a specific SUMOylation protease). We further showed that FOXP2 is selectively SUMOylated in vivo on a phylogenetically conserved lysine 674 but the SUMOylation does not alter subcellular localization and stability of FOXP2. Interestingly, we observed that human etiological FOXP2 R553H mutation robustly reduces its SUMOylation potential as compared to wild-type FOXP2. In addition, the acidic residues downstream the core SUMO motif on FOXP2 are required for its full SUMOylation capacity. Finally, our functional analysis using reporter gene assays showed that SUMOylation may modulate transcriptional activity of FOXP2 in regulating downstream target genes (DISC1, SRPX2, and MiR200c). Altogether, we provide the first evidence that FOXP2 is a substrate for SUMOylation and SUMOylation of FOXP2 plays a functional role in regulating its transcriptional activity."

OBJECTIVE: To identify a blood RNA expression signature that distinguishes bacterial from viral infection in febrile children. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Febrile children presenting to participating hospitals in the United Kingdom, Spain, the Netherlands, and the United States between 2009-2013 were prospectively recruited, comprising a discovery group and validation group. Each group was classified after microbiological investigation as having definite bacterial infection, definite viral infection, or indeterminate infection. RNA expression signatures distinguishing definite bacterial from viral infection were identified in the discovery group and diagnostic performance assessed in the validation group. Additional validation was undertaken in separate studies of children with meningococcal disease (n = 24) and inflammatory diseases (n = 48) and on published gene expression datasets. EXPOSURES: A 2-transcript RNA expression signature distinguishing bacterial infection from viral infection was evaluated against clinical and microbiological diagnosis. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Definite bacterial and viral infection was confirmed by culture or molecular detection of the pathogens. Performance of the RNA signature was evaluated in the definite bacterial and viral group and in the indeterminate infection group. RESULTS: The discovery group of 240 children (median age, 19 months; 62% male) included 52 with definite bacterial infection, of whom 36 (69%) required intensive care, and 92 with definite viral infection, of whom 32 (35%) required intensive care. Ninety-six children had indeterminate infection. Analysis of RNA expression data identified a 38-transcript signature distinguishing bacterial from viral infection. A smaller (2-transcript) signature (FAM89A and IFI44L) was identified by removing highly correlated transcripts. When this 2-transcript signature was implemented as a disease risk score in the validation group (130 children, with 23 definite bacterial, 28 definite viral, and 79 indeterminate infections; median age, 17 months; 57% male), all 23 patients with microbiologically confirmed definite bacterial infection were classified as bacterial (sensitivity, 100% [95% CI, 100%-100%]) and 27 of 28 patients with definite viral infection were classified as viral (specificity, 96.4% [95% CI, 89.3%-100%]). When applied to additional validation datasets from patients with meningococcal and inflammatory diseases, bacterial infection was identified with a sensitivity of 91.7% (95% CI, 79.2%-100%) and 90.0% (95% CI, 70.0%-100%), respectively, and with specificity of 96.0% (95% CI, 88.0%-100%) and 95.8% (95% CI, 89.6%-100%). Of the children in the indeterminate groups, 46.3% (63/136) were classified as having bacterial infection, although 94.9% (129/136) received antibiotic treatment. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study provides preliminary data regarding test accuracy of a 2-transcript host RNA signature discriminating bacterial from viral infection in febrile children. Further studies are needed in diverse groups of patients to assess accuracy and clinical utility of this test in different clinical settings."

Until now, the four orally available medications, fingolimod, dimethylfumarate (BG-12), teriflunomide, and cladribine have received market authorization, whereas laquinimod is still under development. Fingolimod is a sphingosine-1-phosphate inhibitor, which is typically used as escalation therapy and leads to up to 60% reduction of the annualized relapse rate, but might also have neuroprotective properties. In addition, there are three more specific S1P agonists in late stages of development: siponimod, ponesimod, and ozanimod. Dimethylfumarate has immunomodulatory and cytoprotective functions and is used as baseline therapy. Teriflunomide, the active metabolite of the rheumatoid arthritis medication leflunomide, targets the dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, thus inhibiting the proliferation of lymphocytes by depletion of pyrimidines. Here we will review the mechanisms of action, clinical trial data, as well as data about safety and tolerability of the compounds."

By specifically binding to a genetically conserved sequence in the 3' untranslated region of mutant and wild-type transthyretin (TTR) messenger RNA, patisiran causes its degradation (via RNA interference) and subsequently a reduction in serum TTR protein levels and tissue TTR protein deposits. Patisiran has been developed by Alnylam Pharmaceuticals; it was recently approved in the USA for the treatment of the polyneuropathy of hereditary TTR-mediated amyloidosis (hATTR) in adults and subsequently approved in the EU for the treatment of hATTR in adults with stage 1 or 2 polyneuropathy. The recommended dosage, administered as a single intravenous infusion over approximately 80 min, is 0.3 mg/kg once every 3 weeks for patients weighing < 100 kg and 30 mg once every 3 weeks for patients weighing >= 100 kg.

Critically ill COVID patients are at increased risk of serious thrombotic events and hence increased mortality. On the other side, COVID-19 patients are also showing major life-threatening bleeds, especially when systemic anticoagulation is used. Pro-coagulant propensity in critically ill COVID-19 patients have been published, but very few have described the incidence of major bleeding and its characteristics. METHODS: In this study, we retrospectively observed the incidence of major bleed in 25 critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit at the American University of Beirut Medical Center. Six cases were identified and described together with their outcome. RESULTS: Major bleeding occurred in six of the 25 studied patients. Four patients were on therapeutic anticoagulation at the onset of the bleed, two required embolization for bleeding control and one died from hemorrhagic shock. Half of the described cases had unusual sites of bleeding including gluteal and abdominal wall muscles. CONCLUSIONS: A high rate of major bleeding was witnessed in our sample of critically ill patients with COVID-19 infection, with the majority being on therapeutic anticoagulation. This rate may be higher than previously reported, necessitating additional attention from the treating physician when considering empiric therapeutic anticoagulation. Moreover, the uncommon sites of bleeding shed the light on the need for additional studies in our population to identify the predisposing risk factors and mechanisms behind it."

Supportive findings included: hypokalemia (2.1 to 2.9 mmol/l), metabolic alkalosis (31 to 34 mmol/l), hyperkaliuresis (5.8 to 7.1 mmol/kg/day), hypomagnesemia (0.58 to 0.64 mmol/l), hypermagnesuria (0.19 to 0.23 mmol/kg/day), hypocalciuria (0.012 to 0.021 mmol/kg/day). Blood pressure contrasting with high renin activity (19.04 to 20.03 ng/ml/hr) was normal.

In order to study the possibility of improving the efficacy of therapies directed against HER2/erbB2, we investigated the effects of co-targeting this receptor and the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R), a widely-expressed protein tyrosine kinase with important roles in suppression of apoptosis and stimulation of proliferation. MATERIAL/METHODS: The experimental strategy involved combining trastuzumab treatment and reduction of IGF-1R signaling through incremental heat-induced expression of the dominant-negative IGF-1 receptor 486/STOP under the control of the heat-sensitive Drosophila HSP70 promoter, in HER2/erbB2-overexpressing MCF7her18 breast cancer cells. RESULTS: Isobologram analysis of combinatorial treatment data revealed a strong synergistic interaction between trastuzumab treatment and the induction of the dominant-negative IGF-1R expression, resulting in potentiation of growth inhibition in transfected cancer cells. CONCLUSIONS: These observations support the concept that simultaneously co-targeting tyrosine kinase receptors may be therapeutically useful, and provide a specific rationale for combining IGF-1R and HER2/erbB2 targeting strategies in anti-neoplastic approaches."

In our previous report, PAD2 expressed mainly in the rat cerebrum became activated early in the neurodegenerative process. To elucidate the involvement of protein citrullination in human neuronal degeneration, we examined whether citrullinated proteins are produced during Alzheimer's disease (AD). By Western blot analysis with antimodified citrulline antibody, citrullinated proteins of varied molecular weights were detected in hippocampal tissues from patients with AD but not normal humans. Two of the citrullinated proteins were identified as vimentin and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) by using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Interestingly, PAD2 was detected in hippocampal extracts from AD and normal brains, but the amount of PAD2 in the AD tissue was markedly greater. Histochemical analysis revealed citrullinated proteins throughout the hippocampus, especially in the dentate gyrus and stratum radiatum of CA1 and CA2 areas. However, no citrullinated proteins were detected in the normal hippocampus. PAD2 immunoreactivity was also ubiquitous throughout both the AD and the normal hippocampal areas. PAD2 enrichment coincided well with citrullinated protein positivity. Double immunofluorescence staining revealed that citrullinated protein- and PAD2-positive cells also coincided with GFAP-positive cells, but not all GFAP-positive cells were positive for PAD2. As with GFAP, which is an astrocyte-specific marker protein, PAD2 is distributed mainly in astrocytes. These collective results, the abnormal accumulation of citrullinated proteins and abnormal activation of PAD2 in hippocampi of patients with AD, strongly suggest that PAD has an important role in the onset and progression of AD and that citrullinated proteins may become a useful marker for human neurodegenerative diseases."

The autosomal dominant form of CPVT is caused by mutations in the RyR2 gene encoding the cardiac isoform of the ryanodine receptor. In vitro functional characterization of mutant RyR2 channels showed altered behavior on adrenergic stimulation and caffeine administration with enhanced calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. As of today no experimental evidence is available to demonstrate that RyR2 mutations can reproduce the arrhythmias observed in CPVT patients. We developed a conditional knock-in mouse model carrier of the R4496C mutation, the mouse equivalent to the R4497C mutations identified in CPVT families, to evaluate if the animals would develop a CPVT phenotype and if beta blockers would prevent arrhythmias. Twenty-six mice (12 wild-type (WT) and 14RyR(R4496C)) underwent exercise stress testing followed by epinephrine administration: none of the WT developed ventricular tachycardia (VT) versus 5/14 RyR(R4496C) mice (P=0.02). Twenty-one mice (8 WT, 8 RyR(R4496C), and 5 RyR(R4496C) pretreated with beta-blockers) received epinephrine and caffeine: 4/8 (50%) RyR(R4496C) mice but none of the WT developed VT (P=0.02); 4/5 RyR(R4496C) mice pretreated with propranolol developed VT (P=0.56 nonsignificant versus RyR(R4496C) mice). These data provide the first experimental demonstration that the R4496C RyR2 mutation predisposes the murine heart to VT and VF in response caffeine and/or adrenergic stimulation. Furthermore, the results show that analogous to what is observed in patients, beta adrenergic stimulation seems ineffective in preventing life-threatening arrhythmias."

Incubation of reaction mixtures at higher temperatures (30-36 degrees C) resulted in an increase of CEV linear molecules and the recovery of incomplete or nicked newly synthesized RNA species. Although the Mg(2+) optimum (2.5-5 mM) for CEV synthesis was lower than that for total [(32)P]CMP incorporation (10 mM), the response to Mn(2+) ion was distinctly different. Whereas maximum total activity was observed in 1 mM Mn(2+) with a pronounced reduction (80%) in 5 mM Mn(2+), CEV synthesis was maintained in 1-15 mM Mn(2+).

In vitro studies suggest that a reduced antagonistic effect of DKK1 on canonical Wnt signaling contributes to the molecular effect of this mutation and its pathogenic consequence. INTRODUCTION: Gain-of-function mutations in the gene encoding LDL receptor-related protein 5 (LRP5) cause high bone mass. Recent studies revealed that a reduced inhibition of canonical Wnt signaling by Dickkopf 1 (DKK1) contributes to the pathophysiology of this disease phenotype. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We report on a 55-yr-old female patient with a high bone mass phenotype. Sequencing of exons 2-4 of the LRP5 gene was carried out to screen for disease-associated mutations in genomic DNA of the patient. The effect of the identified mutation on LRP5 membrane trafficking was studied by immunoblotting of a truncated form of LRP5. Additionally, Wnt signal activation in the absence and presence of DKK1 was assessed using a TCF4-based reporter gene assay in Saos-2 cells. RESULTS: Our patient presents with dense bones (Z-scores > +6), and radiographic examination showed a generalized thickening of the skeleton. BMD at the hip and lumbar spine significantly decreased through the passage to menopause, indicating no protection to bone loss. Further clinical evaluation revealed torus palatinus. Mutation analysis showed the presence of a novel heterozygous missense variant (844A-->G; M282V) in LRP5, located in the first beta-propeller domain of the extracellular portion. Although protein secretion seemed to be impaired, this mutant was able to transduce Wnt signals at levels comparable with wildtype LRP5. We additionally observed a less efficient inhibition of canonical Wnt signaling by DKK1. CONCLUSIONS: Like all high BMD-associated gain-of-function LRP5 mutations described thus far, the M282V variant affects an amino acid located in the first beta-propeller domain, underlining the functional importance of this region in the pathophysiology of these conditions. This mutation most likely alters a region important for LRP5 modulation by DKK."

DKK1 is also implicated in osteoporosis, arthritis, and cancer and represents a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of these diseases. DKK1 is a high affinity antagonistic ligand for LRP6, which is a Wnt coreceptor that acts together with the Frizzled serpentine receptor to initiate Wnt signal transduction. Two different models have been proposed to account for the mechanism by which DKK1 antagonizes LRP6 function. One model suggests that DKK1 binding to LRP6 disrupts Wnt-induced Frizzled-LRP6 complex formation, whereas the other model proposes that DKK1 interaction with LRP6 promotes LRP6 internalization and degradation, thereby reducing the cell surface LRP6 level. To clarify the molecular basis of DKK1 action, we examined how DKK1 affects the endogenous LRP6 in several mammalian cell lines including mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Here we show that DKK1 inhibits Wnt signaling but induces neither LRP6 down-regulation from the cell surface nor reduction of total LRP6 protein level and that DKK1 has no effect on the rate of continuous internalization of LRP6 and the half-life (about 4.7 h) of LRP6. We conclude that DKK1 inhibition of LRP6 is independent of LRP6 internalization and degradation."

SERCA2a activity is regulated by phosphorylation of another SR protein: Phospholamban (PLN). Dephosphorylated PLN inhibits SERCA2a. Phosphorylation of PLN by either cAMP or cGMP-dependent protein kinase at Ser16 or the Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMKII), at Thr17, relieves this inhibition, increasing SR Ca2+ uptake and SR Ca2+ load. Thus, PLN is a major player in the regulation of myocardial relaxation and contractility. This review will examine the main aspects of the role of CaMKII and Thr17 site of PLN, on different pathophysiological conditions: acidosis, ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) and heart failure (HF). Whereas CaMKII-activation and PLN phosphorylation contribute to the functional recovery during acidosis and stunning, CaMKII results detrimental in the irreversible I/R injury, producing apoptosis and necrosis. Phosphorylation of Thr17 residue of PLN and CaMKII activity vary in the different models of HF. The possible role of these changes in the depressed cardiac function of HF will be discussed."

Similar changes have been observed after general surgical operations. Thyroid hormone changes and their association with global oxygen consumption were studied in low-risk patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with and without CPB. METHODS: Fifty-two patients undergoing primary CABG by the same surgeon were randomised into either on-pump (ONCAB, n=26) or off-pump (OPCAB, n=26) groups. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine (fT4) and free triiodothyronine (fT3) levels were measured at sequential time-points using chemiluminescence assays. Global oxygen consumption was measured at sequential time-points using a continuous cardiac output Swan-Ganz catheter. RESULTS: In both groups TSH and fT4 remained within normal range throughout the study. There was a similar and progressive decline in fT3 levels with no significant difference between the groups over time (p=0.42). Mean fT3 levels at 24h were below the normal range and significantly lower than baseline values (ONCAB, 3.3+/-0.69 pmol/L vs 5.1+/-0.41 pmol/L, p<0.001; OPCAB, 3.3+/-0.51 pmol/L vs 5.0+/-0.46 pmol/L, p<0.001). There was a significant inverse relationship between fT3 levels and global oxygen consumption. CONCLUSIONS: Off-pump surgery is associated with thyroid hormone changes similar to conventional surgical revascularisation. The data suggest that further studies into T3 administration during OPCAB may be warranted."

Intramural haematoma is a quite uncommon but potentially lethal aortic disease that can strike as a primary occurrence in hypertensive and atherosclerotic patients to whom there is spontaneous bleeding from vasa vasorum into the aortic wall (media) or less frequently, as the evolution of a penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer (PAU). IMH displays a typical of dissection progress, and could be considered as a precursor of classic aortic dissection. IMH enfeebles the aortic wall and may progress to either outward rupture of the aorta or inward disruption of the intima layer, which ultimately results in aortic dissection. Chest and back acute penetrating pain is the most commonly noticed symptom at patients with IMH. Apart from a transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), a tomographic imaging such as a chest computed tomography (CT), a magnetic resonance (MRI) and most lately a multy detector computed tomography (MDCT) can ensure a quick and accurate diagnosis of IMH. Similar to type A and B aortic dissection, surgery is indicated at patients with type-A IMH, as well as at patients with a persistent and/or recurrent pain. For any other patient (with type-B IMH without an incessant pain and/or without complications), medical treatment is suggested, as applied in the case of aortic dissection. The outcome of IMH in ascending aorta (type A) appears favourable after immediate (emergent or urgent) surgical intervention, but according to international bibliography patients with IMH of the descending aorta (type B) show similar mortality rates to those being subjected to conservative medical or surgical treatment. Endovascular surgery and stent-graft placement is currently indicated in type B IMH."

The responsible genes encode proteins involved in electrolyte tubular reabsorption. Prenatal manifestations, mainly recurrent polyhydramnios because of fetal polyuria, lead to premature delivery. After birth, polyuria leads to life-threatening dehydration. Prenatal genetic diagnosis needs an index case. The aim of this study was to analyze amniotic fluid biochemistry for the prediction of Bartter syndrome. We retrospectively studied 16 amniotic fluids of Bartter syndrome-affected fetuses diagnosed after birth, only six of them being genetically proven. We assayed total proteins, alpha-fetoprotein, and electrolytes and defined a Bartter index corresponding to the multiplication of total protein and of alpha-fetoprotein. Results were compared with two control groups matched for gestational age-non-Bartter polyhydramnios (n = 30) and nonpolyhydramnios (n = 60). In Bartter syndrome, we observed significant differences (p < 0.0001) for protein amniotic fluid levels when compared with the two control groups (1.55 g/L, 3.9 g/L, and 5.2 g/L, respectively) and low Bartter index (0.16, 0.82, and 1.0, respectively). No statistical difference was observed for electrolytes. In conclusion, Bartter syndrome can be prenatally suspected on amniotic fluid biochemistry (sensitivity 93% and specificity 100%), allowing appropriate management before and after birth."

PGRN haploinsufficiency caused by autosomal dominant mutations within the GRN gene leads to progressive neuronal atrophy in the form of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). This form of the disease is associated with neuronal inclusions that bear the ubiquitinated TAR DNA Binding Protein-43 (TDP-43) molecular signature (FTLD-U). The neurotrophic properties of PGRN in vitro have recently been reported but the role of PGRN in neurons is not well understood. Here we document the neuronal expression and functions of PGRN in spinal cord motoneuron (MN) maturation and branching in vivo using zebrafish, a well established model of vertebrate embryonic development. RESULTS: Whole-mount in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical analyses of zebrafish embryos revealed that zfPGRN-A is expressed within the peripheral and central nervous systems including the caudal primary (CaP) MNs within the spinal cord. Knockdown of zfPGRN-A mRNA translation mediated by antisense morpholino oligonucleotides disrupted normal CaP MN development resulting in both truncated MNs and inappropriate early branching. Ectopic over-expression of zfPGRN-A mRNA resulted in increased MN branching and rescued the truncation defects brought about by knockdown of zfPGRN-A expression. The ability of PGRN to interact with established MN developmental pathways was tested. PGRN over-expression was found to reverse the truncation defect resulting from knockdown of Survival of motor neuron 1 (smn1). This is involved in small ribonucleoprotein biogenesis RNA processing, mutations of which cause Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) in humans. It did not reverse the MN defects caused by interfering with the neuronal guidance pathway by knockdown of expression of NRP-1, a semaphorin co-receptor. CONCLUSIONS: Expression of PGRN within MNs and the observed phenotypes resulting from mRNA knockdown and over-expression are consistent with a role in the regulation of spinal cord MN development and branching. This study presents the first in vivo demonstration of the neurotrophic properties of PGRN and suggests possible future therapeutic applications in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases."

Abnormal mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex signaling and defects in TSC1 and TSC2 have been associated with the development of subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs) in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) patients. Recently, mTOR inhibitors such as everolimus have shown encouraging benefit for patients with SEGAs. AREAS COVERED: The authors discuss a molecular genetic pathway linked with TSC, specifically the role of two proteins whose functional absence is responsible for most SEGA tumors that arise in TSC patients. The authors also examine the rationale for targeted agents against this pathway therapeutically and describe the clinical evidence underlying the FDA approval of everolimus for patients with inoperable SEGAs. EXPERT OPINION: Everolimus (Afinitor) selectively targets a molecular defect of SEGAs in TSC patients. Although surgery is effective, most SEGAs recur. An agent that inhibits an underlying molecular abnormality represents a particularly attractive therapeutic option for patients with inoperable or recurrent tumors. Studies are also underway to assess everolimus in treating other sequelae of TSC, and other gliomas. Finally, additional research aimed at better understanding aberrant cell signaling pathways may lead to the development of more effective therapeutics."

However, DNA copy number and gene expression signatures indicate differences between adult and paediatric cases. To explore the genetic events underlying this distinction, we sequenced the exomes of 48 paediatric GBM samples. Somatic mutations in the H3.3-ATRX-DAXX chromatin remodelling pathway were identified in 44% of tumours (21/48). Recurrent mutations in H3F3A, which encodes the replication-independent histone 3 variant H3.3, were observed in 31% of tumours, and led to amino acid substitutions at two critical positions within the histone tail (K27M, G34R/G34V) involved in key regulatory post-translational modifications. Mutations in ATRX (alpha-thalassaemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked) and DAXX (death-domain associated protein), encoding two subunits of a chromatin remodelling complex required for H3.3 incorporation at pericentric heterochromatin and telomeres, were identified in 31% of samples overall, and in 100% of tumours harbouring a G34R or G34V H3.3 mutation. Somatic TP53 mutations were identified in 54% of all cases, and in 86% of samples with H3F3A and/or ATRX mutations. Screening of a large cohort of gliomas of various grades and histologies (n = 784) showed H3F3A mutations to be specific to GBM and highly prevalent in children and young adults. Furthermore, the presence of H3F3A/ATRX-DAXX/TP53 mutations was strongly associated with alternative lengthening of telomeres and specific gene expression profiles. This is, to our knowledge, the first report to highlight recurrent mutations in a regulatory histone in humans, and our data suggest that defects of the chromatin architecture underlie paediatric and young adult GBM pathogenesis."

Cafe-au-lait macules (CALM) may occasionally be seen in piebaldism. There are four reports describing six patients who were said to have both piebaldism and neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) due to the presence of multiple CALM and intertriginous freckling, but none of these patients had undergone comprehensive NF1 mutation analysis. We describe a large family with piebaldism in which two members meet diagnostic criteria for NF1 based on the presence of >5 CALM and intertriginous freckling. Interestingly, only these two family members are of mixed race, which could be of importance. A novel complex mutation in the KIT gene was identified in several family members affected with piebaldism; the proband meeting diagnostic criteria for NF1 also underwent comprehensive NF1 and SPRED1 testing with no mutations detected. These findings suggest that piebaldism may occasionally include CALM and intertriginous freckling, which may create diagnostic confusion especially in the absence of a family history of piebaldism. However, careful clinical evaluation and molecular testing if necessary should distinguish these two disorders."

CPVT is caused by DADs (delayed after-depolarizations) that are induced by spontaneous Ca2+ release during SR (sarcoplasmic reticulum) Ca2+ overload, a process also known as SOICR (store-overload-induced Ca2+ release). A number of mutations in the cardiac ryanodine receptor RyR2 are linked to CPVT. Many of these CPVT-associated RyR2 mutations enhance the propensity for SOICR and DADs by sensitizing RyR2 to luminal or luminal/cytosolic Ca2+ activation. Recently, a novel CPVT RyR2 mutation, G230C, was found to increase the cytosolic, but not the luminal, Ca2+ sensitivity of single RyR2 channels in lipid bilayers. This observation led to the suggestion of a SOICR-independent disease mechanism for the G230C mutation. However, the cellular impact of this mutation on SOICR is yet to be determined. To this end, we generated stable inducible HEK (human embryonic kidney)-293 cell lines expressing the RyR2 WT (wild-type) and the G230C mutant. Using single-cell Ca2+ imaging, we found that the G230C mutation markedly enhanced the propensity for SOICR and reduced the SOICR threshold. Furthermore, the G230C mutation increased the sensitivity of single RyR2 channels to both luminal and cytosolic Ca2+ activation and the Ca2+-dependent activation of [3H]ryanodine binding. In addition, the G230C mutation decreased the thermal stability of the N-terminal region (amino acids 1-547) of RyR2. These data suggest that the G230C mutation enhances the propensity for SOICR by sensitizing the channel to luminal and cytosolic Ca2+ activation, and that G230C has an intrinsic structural impact on the N-terminal domains of RyR2.

It is primarily a zoonotic disease, especially the monkeys. Worldwide, an estimated 200,000 cases of yellow fever occurred each year, and the case-fatality rate is ~15%. Forty-five endemic countries in Africa and Latin America, with a population of close to 1 billion, are at risk. Up to 50% of severely affected persons from YF die without treatment. During 2009, 55 cases and 18 deaths were reported from Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. Brazil reported the maximum number of cases and death, i.e., 42 cases with 11 deaths. From January 2010 to March 2011, outbreaks of YF were reported to the WHO by Cameroon, Democratic Republic of Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Senegal, and Uganda. Cases were also reported in three northern districts of Abim, Agago, and Kitugun near the border with South Sudan. YF usually causes fever, muscle pain with prominent backache, headache, shivers, loss of appetite, and nausea or vomiting. Most patients improve, and their symptoms disappear after 3 to 4 d. Half of the patients who enter the toxic phase die within 10-14 d, while the rest recover without significant organ damage. Vaccination has been the single most important measure for preventing YF. The 17D-204 YF vaccine is a freeze-dried, live attenuated, highly effective vaccine. It is available in single-dose or multi-dose vials and should be stored at 2-8  C. It is reconstituted with normal saline and should be used within 1 h of reconstitution. The 0.5 mL dose is delivered subcutaneously. Revaccination is recommended every 10 y for people at continued risk of exposure to yellow fever virus (YFV). This vaccine is available worldwide. Travelers, especially to Africa or Latin America from Asia, must have a certificate documenting YF vaccination, which is required by certain countries for entry under the International Health Regulations (IHR) of the WHO."

Unlike standard chemotherapy or targeted agents, which act directly on the tumor cells, immune checkpoint inhibitors work by restoring the immune system's capacity to eradicate tumors. Agents currently in active clinical development for lung cancer include ipilimumab, which modulates the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 pathway, and multiple agents targeting the programmed death protein 1 (PD-1) pathway, both anti-PD-1 compounds (nivolumab, pembrolizumab [MK-3475]) and those that target programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), a key ligand for PD-1 (BMS-936559, MPDL3280A). Preliminary evidence shows activity for these agents in NSCLC as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy. This article reviews the immune checkpoint inhibitors and the available data to date on their use in lung cancer. Clinical implications for the use of these therapies in NSCLC are discussed as they relate to their novel mechanisms of action, response patterns, and safety profiles. "

In preparation for translation of this cardioprotective strategy into clinical practice during heart surgery, we further optimised conditions for this intervention using a clinically-relevant dose of Iso and determined its cardioprotective efficacy in hearts isolated from a model of surgically-induced heart failure. METHODS: Isolated Langendorff-perfused rat hearts were treated sequentially with 5 nM Iso and 30 muM Ade followed by different durations of washout prior to 30 min global ischaemia and 2 hrs reperfusion. Reperfusion injury was assessed by measuring haemodynamic function, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release and infarct size. Protein kinase C (PKC) activity and glycogen content were measured in hearts after the treatment. In a separate group of hearts, Cyclosporine A (CsA), a mitochondria permeability transition pore (MPTP) inhibitor, was added with Iso/Ade. Failing hearts extracted after 16 weeks of ligation of left coronary artery in 2 months old rats were also subjected to Iso/Ade treatment followed by ischaemia/reperfusion. RESULTS: Recovery of the rate pressure product (RPP) in Iso/Ade-treated hearts was significantly higher than in controls. Thus in Iso/Ade treated hearts with 5 nM Iso and no washout period, RPP recovery was 76.3+-6.9% of initial value vs. 28.5+-5.2% in controls. This was associated with a 3 fold reduction in LDH release irrespective to the duration of the washout period. Hearts with no washout of the drugs (Ade) had least infarct size, highest PKC activity and also showed reduced glycogen content. Cardioprotection with CsA was not additive to the effect of Iso/Ade treatment. Iso/Ade treatment conferred significant protection to failing hearts. Thus, RPP recovery in failing hearts subjected to the treatment was 69.0+-16.3% while in Control hearts 19.7+-4.0%. LDH release in these hearts was also 3 fold lower compared to Control. CONCLUSIONS: Consecutive Iso/Ade treatment of normal heart can be effective at clinically-relevant doses and this effect appears to be mediated by glycogen depletion and inhibition of MPTP. This intervention protects clinically relevant failing heart model making it a promising candidate for clinical use."

We evaluated the effects of curcumin on the behaviour of mouse OECs to determine if it could be of use to further enhance the therapeutic potential of OECs. Curcumin, a natural polyphenol compound found in the spice turmeric, is known for its anti-cancer properties at doses over 10 microM, and often at 50 microM, and it exerts its effects on cancer cells in part by activation of MAP kinases. In contrast, we found that low-dose curcumin (0.5 microM) applied to OECs strikingly modulated the dynamic morphology, increased the rate of migration by up to 4-fold, and promoted significant proliferation of the OECs. Most dramatically, low-dose curcumin stimulated a 10-fold increase in the phagocytic activity of OECs. All of these potently stimulated behavioural characteristics of OECs are favourable for neural repair therapies. Importantly, low-dose curcumin gave a transient activation of p38 kinases, which is in contrast to the high dose curcumin effects on cancer cells in which these MAP kinases tend to undergo prolonged activation. Low-dose curcumin mediated effects on OECs demonstrate cell-type specific stimulation of p38 and ERK kinases. These results constitute the first evidence that low-dose curcumin can modulate the behaviour of olfactory glia into a phenotype potentially more favourable for neural repair and thereby improve the therapeutic use of OECs for neural repair therapies.

However, little is known about the effects and mechanisms of SST in dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the context of Parkinson's disease (PD). In the present study, a model of PD was generated by injecting lipopolysaccharide (LPS) into the substantia nigra (SN) of rats in order to investigate the effects of SST on LPS-induced degeneration of DA in vivo. Intramural injection of LPS resulted in a significant loss of DA neurons, while reduction of neuronal death by SST pretreatment was confirmed using immunohistochemical staining for tyrosine hydroxylase and Nissl. In parallel, immunohistochemical detection of OX-42 and hydroethidine staining were employed to determine the activation of microglia and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), respectively. It was found that SST inhibited the LPS-induced microglial activity and ROS production. ELISA revealed a decreased production of pro-inflammatory mediators, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1beta and prostaglandin E2 when SST was administered prior to LPS treatment. Western blot analysis showed that LPS-induced expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase-2 and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) p-p65 was attenuated by administration of SST prior to LPS application. The results indicated that LPS-induced loss of nigral DA neurons was inhibited by SST and the observed effects of SST on neuroprotection were associated with suppression of microglial activation and the NF-kappaB pathway, ensuing decreases of neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. The present study therefore suggested that SST is beneficial for treating neurodegenerative diseases, such as PD, through inhibiting the activation of microglia."

RESULTS: The response rate was 88%. Induction of anesthesia in patients with elevated intracranial pressure is carried out with propofol/fentanyl/rocuronium in >80% of the intensive care units (ICU), 60% use midazolam, 33.3% use esketamine, 13.3% use barbiturates and 6.7% use etomidate. For maintenance of analgosedation up to 72 h, propofol is used by 80% of the ICUs, followed by remifentanil (46.7%), sufentanil (40%) and fentanyl (6.7%). For long-term sedation, 86.7% of ICUs use midazolam, 73.3% sufentanil and 73.3% esketamine. For sedation periods longer than 7 days, 21.4% of ICUs use propofol. Reasons for discontinuing propofol are signs of rhabdomyolysis (92.9%), green urine, elevated liver enzymes (71.4% each) and elevated triglycerides (57.1%). Muscle relaxants are only used during invasive procedures. Inducing a barbiturate coma is rated as a last resort by 53.3% of respondents. The monitoring methods used are bispectral index (BIS , 61.5% of ICUs), somatosensory-evoked potentials (SSEP, 53.8%), processed electroencephalography (EEG, 38.5%), intraparenchymal partial pressure of oxygen (pO2, 38.5%) and microdialysis (23.1%).

Collagen type VI (COL VI) is upregulated in renal fibrosis. Endotrophin is released from COL VI and promotes pleiotropic pro-fibrotic effects. Kidney disease severity varies considerably and accurate information regarding CKD progression may improve clinical decisions. We tested the hypothesis that urinary endotrophin derived during COL VI deposition in fibrotic human kidneys is a marker for progression of CKD in the Renal Impairment in Secondary Care (RIISC) cohort, a prospective observational study of 499 CKD patients. Endotrophin localised to areas of increased COL VI deposition in fibrotic kidneys but was not present in histologically normal kidneys. The third and fourth quartiles of urinary endotrophin:creatinine ratio (ECR) were independently associated with one-year disease progression after adjustment for traditional risk factors (OR (95%CI) 3.68 (1.06-12.83) and 8.65 (2.46-30.49), respectively).

CollagenVI-alpha3 chain (COL6A3) is a biomarker for hepatic fibrosis and poor prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but its function in liver pathology remains unknown. High levels of COL6A3 and its cleaved product, endotrophin (ETP) in tumor-neighboring regions are strongly associated with poor prognosis in HCC patients. Here, we report that the high levels of ETP in injured hepatocytes induce JNK-dependent hepatocyte apoptosis and activate nonparenchymal cells to lead further activation of hepatic inflammation, fibrosis, and apoptosis. Nevertheless ETP per se showed limited phenotypic changes in normal liver tissues. Furthermore, inhibition of ETP activity by utilizing neutralizing antibodies efficiently suppressed the pathological consequences in chronic liver diseases. Our results implicate ETP mechanistically as a crucial mediator in reciprocal interactions among various hepatic cell populations in the pathogenesis of chronic liver disease, and it could be a promising therapeutic target particularly in individuals with high local levels of COL6A3.

In a phase 1 dose-finding study, a majority of the patients with advanced HER2-positive breast cancer had a response to trastuzumab deruxtecan (median response duration, 20.7 months). The efficacy of trastuzumab deruxtecan in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer previously treated with trastuzumab emtansine requires confirmation. METHODS: In this two-part, open-label, single-group, multicenter, phase 2 study, we evaluated trastuzumab deruxtecan in adults with pathologically documented HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer who had received previous treatment with trastuzumab emtansine. In the first part of the study, we evaluated three different doses of trastuzumab deruxtecan to establish a recommended dose; in the second part, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of the recommended dose.

During the study, the most common adverse events of grade 3 or higher were a decreased neutrophil count (in 20.7% of the patients), anemia (in 8.7%), and nausea (in 7.6%). On independent adjudication, the trial drug was associated with interstitial lung disease in 13.6% of the patients (grade 1 or 2, 10.9%; grade 3 or 4, 0.5%; and grade 5, 2.2%). CONCLUSIONS: Trastuzumab deruxtecan showed durable antitumor activity in a pretreated patient population with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. In addition to nausea and myelosuppression, interstitial lung disease was observed in a subgroup of patients and requires attention to pulmonary symptoms and careful monitoring.

        "text": "Inhaled Molgramostim Therapy in Autoimmune Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis.\nBACKGROUND: Autoimmune pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (aPAP) is a rare disease characterized by progressive surfactant accumulation and hypoxemia. It is caused by disruption of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) signaling, which pulmonary alveolar macrophages require to clear surfactant. Recently, inhaled GM-CSF was shown to improve the partial pressure of arterial oxygen in patients with aPAP. METHODS: In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-group trial, we randomly assigned patients with aPAP to receive the recombinant GM-CSF molgramostim (300 mug once daily by inhalation), either continuously or intermittently (every other week), or matching placebo. The 24-week intervention period was followed by an open-label treatment-extension period. The primary end point was the change from baseline in the alveolar-arterial difference in oxygen concentration (A-aDo2) at week 24. RESULTS: In total, 138 patients underwent randomization; 46 were assigned to receive continuous molgramostim, 45 to receive intermittent molgramostim, and 47 to receive placebo. Invalid A-aDo2 data for 4 patients (1 in each molgramostim group and 2 in the placebo group) who received nasal oxygen therapy during arterial blood gas measurement were replaced by means of imputation. For the primary end point - the change from baseline in the A-aDo2 at week 24 - improvement was greater among patients receiving continuous molgramostim than among those receiving placebo (-12.8 mm Hg vs. -6.6 mm Hg; estimated treatment difference, -6.2 mm Hg; P = 0.03 by comparison of least-squares means). Patients receiving continuous molgramostim also had greater improvement than those receiving placebo for secondary end points, including the change from baseline in the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire total score at week 24 (-12.4 points vs. -5.1 points; estimated treatment difference, -7.4 points; P = 0.01 by comparison of least-squares means). For multiple end points, improvement was greater with continuous molgramostim than with intermittent molgramostim. The percentages of patients with adverse events and serious adverse events were similar in the three groups, except for the percentage of patients with chest pain, which was higher in the continuous-molgramostim group. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with aPAP, daily administration of inhaled molgramostim resulted in greater improvements in pulmonary gas transfer and functional health status than placebo, with similar rates of adverse events.

        "text": "Golodirsen for Duchenne muscular dystrophy.\nDuchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a life-shortening X-linked genetic disorder characterized by progressive wasting and weakening of muscles in boys. Loss-of-function mutations in the DMD gene, which codes for dystrophin, lead to this disease. The majority of mutations in this gene result in the exclusion of one or more exons from the transcript, eventually causing the remaining exons not to fit together correctly (i.e., out-of-frame mutations). Antisense oligonucleotides, e.g., phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMOs), can induce therapeutic exon skipping during pre-mRNA processing to restore the reading frame of the primary transcript of DMD. As a result, truncated but partially functional dystrophin is produced, potentially slowing down the disease progression. Golodirsen is a provisionally approved PMO-based drug for approx. 8% of all DMD patients amenable to exon 53 skipping. This article summarizes golodirsen's pharmacology, efficacy and safety information. It also discusses some controversies that golodirsen met after the approval."

A retrospective study of 115 cases at a tertiary care hospital in Mexico.\nBACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Cutaneous mucormycosis is an emerging opportunistic mycosis caused by Mucorales. It can be divided into primary caused by trauma and secondary by extension of rhino-cerebral and disseminated cases. The objective is to present a retrospective study of cases of mucormycosis with cutaneous involvement. METHODS: A retrospective and descriptive study was carried out. Mucormycosis patients were included and divided into two groups: a) Primary Cutaneous and b) Secondary Cutaneous. Mycological tests were performed; the agents were identified by morphology and molecular studies (PCR and sequencing); some cases underwent histopathology. Clinical data and response to treatment were collected. RESULTS: 115 cases were included, 18 of primary, and 97 of secondary cutaneous mucormycosis. Primary cutaneous mucormycosis was most associated with adhesive bands (44.4%) and trauma from traffic accidents (33.3%). The principal clinical form was extensive and deep necrotic ulcers. Secondary cutaneous mucormycosis cases were rhino-cerebral with uncontrolled diabetes (81.4%) The most frequent clinical presentation was necrosis of the eyelid and the nose (65.9%). In both groups, the principal agent was Rhizopus arrhizus, 38.8% and 74.2% respectively. The most effective treatment was the combination of amphotericin B with surgical debridement. The clinical and mycological cure was achieved in 31.0% of primary cases, and 44.4% for secondary cases. CONCLUSION: Primary cutaneous mucormycosis is caused by implantation of the Mucorales due to trauma or rupture of the cutaneous barrier-breach, and secondary cutaneous mucormycosis develops as part of the rhino-cerebral process. The response to treatment depends on the extension and depth, as well as the predisposing factors."

METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted. Patients with COVID-19 admitted to Wenzhou Central Hospital from January 17 to February 14, 2020 were enrolled. The general information, chest CT before admission, the first laboratory parameters and chest CT within 24 hours after admission were collected. Patients were followed up for 30 days after the first onset of dyspnea or pulmonary imaging showed that the lesions progressed more than 50% within 24 to 48 hours (according to the criteria for severe cases) as the study endpoint. According to the endpoint, the patients were divided into two groups: mild type/common type group and severe/critical group, and the differences in general information and inflammation index of the two groups were compared. Logistic regression was used to analyze the inflammation index and the severity of COVID-19. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was draw to evaluate the predictive value of early inflammation indicators for severe/critical in patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 140 patients with COVID-19 were included, 74 males and 66 females; the average age was (45+-14) years old; 6 cases (4.3%) of mild type, 107 cases (76.4%) of common type, and 22 cases (15.7%) of severe type, 5 cases (3.6%) were critical. There were significantly differences in ages (years old: 43+-13 vs. 57+-13), the proportion of patients with one chronic disease (17.7% vs. 55.6%), C-reactive protein [CRP (mg/L): 7.3 (2.3, 21.0) vs. 40.1 (18.8, 62.6)], lymphocyte count [LYM (x109/L): 1.3 (1.0, 1.8) vs. 0.8 (0.7, 1.1)], the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio [NLR: 2.1 (1.6, 3.0) vs. 3.1 (2.2, 8.8)] and multilobularinltration, hypo-lymphocytosis, bacterial coinfection, smoking history, hyper-tension and age [MuLBSTA score: 5.0 (3.0, 5.0) vs. 5.0 (5.0, 7.0)] between mild/common group and severe/critical group (all P < 0.05). Univariate Logistic regression analysis showed that CRP, NLR, MuLBSTA score, age, and whether chronic diseases were associated with the severity of COVID-19 [odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) were 1.037 (1.020-1.055), 1.374 (1.123-1.680), 1.574 (1.296-1.911), 1.082 (1.042-1.125), 6.393 (2.551-16.023), respectively, all P < 0.01]. Further multivariate Logistic regression analysis showed that CRP and MuLBSTA score were risk factors for the development of COVID-19 to severe/critical cases [OR and 95%CI were 1.024 (1.002-1.048) and 1.321 (1.027-1.699) respectively, both P < 0.05]. ROC curve analysis showed that the area under the curve for CRP and MuLBSTA score to predict severe/critical cases were both 0.818, and the best cut-off points were 27.4 mg/L and 6.0 points, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: CRP and MuLBSTA score are related to the severity of COVID-19, and may have good independent predictive ability for the development of severe/critical illness."

The accumulation of the mutant ataxin-3 proteins carrying expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) leads to selective degeneration of neurons. Since the pathogenesis of SCA3 has not been fully elucidated, and no effective therapies have been identified, it is crucial to investigate the pathogenesis and seek new therapeutic strategies of SCA3. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can be used as the ideal cell model for the molecular pathogenesis of polyQ diseases. Abnormal CAG expansions mediated by CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering technologies have shown promising potential for the treatment of polyQ diseases, including SCA3. In this study, SCA3-iPSCs can be corrected by the replacement of the abnormal CAG expansions (74 CAG) with normal repeats (17 CAG) using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homologous recombination (HR) strategy. Besides, corrected SCA3-iPSCs retained pluripotent and normal karyotype, which can be differentiated into a neural stem cell (NSCs) and neuronal cells, and maintained electrophysiological characteristics. The expression of differentiation markers and electrophysiological characteristics were similar among the neuronal differentiation from normal control iPSCs (Ctrl-iPSCs), SCA3-iPSCs, and isogenic control SCA3-iPSCs. Furthermore, this study proved that the phenotypic abnormalities in SCA3 neurons, including aggregated IC2-polyQ protein, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and glutathione expressions, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), intracellular Ca2+ concentrations, and lipid peroxidase malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, all were rescued in the corrected SCA3-NCs. For the first time, this study demonstrated the feasibility of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated HR strategy to precisely repair SCA3-iPSCs, and reverse the corresponding abnormal disease phenotypes. In addition, the importance of genetic control using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated iPSCs for disease modeling. Our work may contribute to providing a potential ideal model for molecular mechanism research and autologous stem cell therapy of SCA3 or other polyQ diseases, and offer a good gene therapy strategy for future treatment."

These fungi are found in the environment such as soil, decaying vegetation, and organic matters. Sporangiospores present in the environment enter the human body through inhalation or direct skin inoculation by trauma or ingestion and result in pulmonary, cutaneous, and gastrointestinal mucormycosis, respectively, in immunocompromised hosts. Patients with uncontrolled diabetes, hematological malignancies, high-dose glucocorticoid therapy, iron overload, and organ transplantation are at high risk of acquiring mucormycosis. The second wave of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2] affected India severely with the highest number of cases and deaths compared to all other countries. Additionally, the country was affected by emergence of rare but life-threatening mucormycosis. Currently, many coronavirus disease 2019 patients with underlying risk factors such as uncontrolled diabetes, high-dose steroid therapy, and exposure to mechanical ventilation have developed mucormycosis. Inhalation is the most common mode of transmission that results in colonization of sporangiospores in the nose. In immunocompromised host, sporangiospores germinate, and subsequently form hyphae. These hyphae invade into tissues, and produce tissue infarction, necrosis, and thrombosis. Angioinvasion causes hematogenous dissemination to many organs, predominantly to brain, that result in rhino-orbital-cerebral mucormycosis. Clinical characteristics, radio imaging, fungal culture, histopathology, and molecular techniques are the key diagnostic methods. Surgical intervention and aggressive antifungal therapy are the main management strategies. Amphotericin B is the drug of choice for treatment of mucormycosis, whereas posaconazole or isavuconazole is used for step-down therapy and salvage therapy."

Though incompletely understood, fibroid etiology is multifactorial, a combination of genetic alterations and endocrine, autocrine, environmental, and other factors such as race, age, parity, and body mass index. Black women have greater than an 80% incidence of fibroids by age 50, whereas White women have an incidence approaching 70%. Fibroid symptoms are protean, and menorrhagia is most frequent. The societal economic burden of symptomatic fibroids is large, 5.9 to 34.3 billion dollars annually. There are a variety of treatment options for women with symptomatic fibroids ranging from medical therapy to hysterectomy. Myomectomy and uterine fibroid embolization are the most common uterine sparing therapies. Pelvic ultrasound (transabdominal and transvaginal) with Doppler and MRI with and without intravenous contrast are the best imaging modalities for the initial diagnosis of fibroids, the initial treatment of known fibroids, and for surveillance or posttreatment imaging. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer-reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios.

Thus, the aim of the study was to evaluate the global perception of stress and the menstrual distress in patients with UFs. A cross-sectional observational study was conducted on a group (n = 69) of fertile age women with UFs compared to age-matched controls, by administering two questionnaires: the perceived stress scale (PSS) and the Menstrual Distress Questionnaire (MEDI-Q). The PSS, MEDI-Q Total Score and 3 subscales-menstrual symptoms (MS), menstrual symptoms distress (MSD), and menstrual specificity index (MESI)-were evaluated. Patients with UFs showed higher PSS than controls (18.5 +- 5.0 vs. 13.8 +- 5.0, p < 0.001) and PSS values were very high in those with HMB, severe dysmenorrhea, and impaired social and working life. Patients with UFs also showed significantly higher score for MEDI-Q Total Score (16.51 +- 12.99 vs. 10.86 +- 12.36) (p < 0.01) as well as for the subscales MSD (2.54 +- 1.07 vs. 1.57 +- 0.98) (p < 0.001) and MESI (0.76 +- 0.30 vs 0.60 +- 0.39) (p < 0.05). The menstrual distress was associated to being uncomfortable about uterine bleeding; in fact, MEDI-Q Total Score was significantly higher in women with HMB compared to those with moderate/normal bleeding. UF characteristics (number, type, and size) did not correlate with perceived stress or menstrual distress. In conclusion, women with UFs have significantly higher levels of perceived stress and menstrual distress than controls and HMB plays a major role in determining such conditions."

The key to oncogenic KRAS and MYC working together is the stabilization of MYC expression due to KRAS activating the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, which phosphorylates MYC at serine 62 (Ser 62). This prevents the proteasomal degradation of MYC while enhancing its transcriptional activity. Here, we identify how this essential signaling connection between oncogenic KRAS and MYC expression is mediated by the inhibitor of apoptosis protein family member Survivin. This discovery stemmed from our finding that Survivin expression is downregulated upon treatment of pancreatic cancer cells with the KRASG12C inhibitor Sotorasib. We went on to show that oncogenic KRAS increases Survivin expression by activating extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 in pancreatic cancer cells and that treating the cells either with siRNAs targeting Survivin or with YM155, a small molecule that potently blocks Survivin expression, downregulates MYC and strongly inhibited their growth. We further determined that Survivin protects MYC from degradation by blocking autophagy, which then prevents cellular inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A from undergoing autophagic degradation. Cellular inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A, by inhibiting protein phosphatase 2A, helps to maintain MYC phosphorylation at Ser 62, thereby ensuring its cooperation with oncogenic KRAS in driving cancer progression. Overall, these findings highlight a novel role for Survivin in mediating the cooperative actions of KRAS and MYC during malignant transformation and raise the possibility that targeting Survivin may offer therapeutic benefits against KRAS-driven cancers."

Dysregulation of the interleukin (IL)-6-mediated Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (JAK/STAT3) signaling pathway are closely associated with the development of colorectal cancer (CRC). METHODS: Here, we have evaluated the modulation of the IL-6/JAK/STAT3 pathway of curcumin, desmethoxycurcumin, and bisdesmethoxycurcumin in LoVo and HT-29 colorectal cancer cells with a single molecular array (Simoa), western blot analysis, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and pathway analysis system. RESULTS: The study showed that curcuminoids suppressed the amount of IL-6 in LoVo and HT-29 colorectal cancer cells. Meanwhile, curcuminoids inhibited the expression of inflammation regulator-related microRNA (miRNA). We also found that the expression of total STAT3 was downregulated by curcuminoids. Moreover, the pathway analysis system showed that curcuminoids inactivated the JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway. Taken together, we demonstrated that the anti-cancer activities of curcuminoids against colorectal cancer are due to the modulation of the IL-6/JAK/STAT3 cascade. CONCLUSION: Curcuminoids could be a promising anti-cancer agent for the treatment of human colorectal cancer."

Finally, we compared AUF1 and HuR expression with accumulation of one common target mRNA, c-myc. The similar spatio-temporal distribution of these proteins and of c-myc mRNA is in agreement with a potential concerted role in ARE-mediated control of mRNA stability."

Phenotypic characteristics including intracellular Ca2+ handling, proliferation, viability, RyR2:FKBP12.6 interaction, and beat rate in resting HL-1 cells expressing mutant hRyR2 were indistinguishable from wild-type (WT) hRyR2. However, Ca2+ release was augmented in cells expressing mutant hRyR2 after RyR activation (caffeine and 4-chloro-m-cresol) or beta-adrenergic stimulation (isoproterenol). RyR2:FKBP12.6 interaction remained intact after caffeine or 4-CMC activation, but was dramatically disrupted by isoproterenol or forskolin, an activator of adenylate cyclase. Isoproterenol and forskolin elevated cyclic-AMP to similar magnitudes in all cells and were associated with equivalent hyperphosphorylation of mutant and WT hRyR2. CPVT-linked mutations in hRyR2 did not alter resting cardiomyocyte phenotype but mediated augmented Ca2+ release on RyR-agonist or beta-AR stimulation. Furthermore, equivalent interaction between mutant and WT hRyR2 and FKBP12.6 was demonstrated."

The final step in our methodology consists of fine mapping of the candidate susceptible DNA regions by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) analysis. This approach was validated upon application to rheumatoid arthritis, a destructive joint disease affecting up to 1% of the population. A total of 47 candidate regions were identified. The top seven loci, withstanding the most stringent statistical tests, were dissected down to individual genes and/or SNPs on four chromosomes, including the previously known 6p21.3-encoded Major Histocompatibility Complex gene, HLA-DRB1.

While intracranial complications of sinusitis are rare, the morbidity and mortality remain high. Subdural empyema is recognized as the most common sinogenic intracranial complication. We undertook a review of our cases of subdural empyema and other intracranial complications of sinusitis over the past 8 years at a busy inner city hospital. Our intent was to identify factors that may predispose children to these serious complications. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted using ICD-9 codes to identify pediatric patients treated for complications of sinusitis at University Hospital (UH) from 1996 to 2004. Only patients age 18 or younger at the time of admission were included in this study. The following data were collected from hospital medical records: age, gender, past medical and social history, presenting symptoms, history of present illness, microbiology, surgical and medical intervention, and outcome. RESULTS: Twelve patients were identified that fit the criteria for this study. The mean age of these patients was 14.1 years, and 10 of our 12 patients were male (83.3%). The most common presenting complaints were fever, headache, altered mental status, orbital cellulitis, nasal symptoms, nausea and vomiting, and photophobia. In the week prior to admission for intracranial complications, nine patients were seen by a physician: five patients were seen in the ER and four by a primary care physician. Subdural empyema was the most commonly observed intracranial complication in this series. Microaerophilic and anaerobic organisms were most commonly identified in this series. Most sinus procedures consisted of endoscopic ethmoid and maxillary sinus drainage. There was a long-term morbidity rate of 16% and a mortality rate of 8%. CONCLUSIONS: Three conclusions may be drawn from this study. First, the morbidity and mortality of intracranial complications of sinusitis remain high in the pediatric inner-city population despite adequate access to medical care. Second, subdural empyema appears to arise in the setting of subacute rather than acute frontal sinusitis. Lastly, there may be an under-diagnosis and delay in treatment of patients with frontal sinusitis, resulting in subsequent intracranial complications."

While scientific knowledge about PGx is rapidly increasing, implementation of PGx findings to patient care has yet to be fully achieved. One area where significant progress has been made is in the identification of PGx markers associated with variable response to antiretroviral medicines. For example, the major histocompatibility complex HLA-B*5701 allele has been associated with hypersensitivity to abacavir (ABC) by several independent researchers. While PGx associations have been identified largely through retrospective examination, the clinical utility of these PGx markers in patient care has not been prospectively determined in a randomized study. This paper outlines the design of a study to evaluate the utility of prospective screening for HLA-B*5701 to reduce the incidence of ABC hypersensitivity in an ABC-naive population of HIV-infected subjects. This represents the first fully powered, randomized, blinded, prospective study to determine the clinical utility of PGx screening to reduce drug-associated adverse events in any patient population. This type of trial design may have utility for other important medicines which have treatment-limiting side effects."

PGX is often viewed as an extension of disease association genetics, and although this information may be related, it is not the study of drug response. Although medicines are used to treat diseases, the value of strategies that identify and incorporate DNA biomarkers associated with clinical efficacy, or DNA biomarkers for untoward clinical responses, can be applied directly to pharmaceutical pipelines. The growth of adverse event PGX studies involving marketed medicines generally uses relatively large numbers of affected patients, but has been productive. However, the two critical strategies for pipeline genetics must make use of fewer patients: (1) the early identification of efficacy signals so that they can be applied early in development for targeted therapies and (2) identification of safety signals that can subsequently be validated prospectively during development using the least number of patients with adverse responses. Assumptions are often made that large numbers of patients are necessary to recognize PGX hypotheses and to validate DNA biomarkers. In some ways, pipeline pharmacogenetics may be viewed as the opposite of current genome-wide scanning designs. The goal is to obtain PGX signals in as few patients as possible, and then validate PGX hypotheses for specificity and sensitivity as development trials go forward--not using hundreds of thousand of markers to detect strong linkage disequilibrium signals in thousands of patients and their controls. Drug development takes 5-7 years for a drug candidate to traverse to registration--and this is similar to the timeframe for validating genetic biomarkers using sequential clinical trials. Two important examples are discussed, the association of APOE genotypes to the demonstration of actionable efficacy signals for the use of rosiglitazone for Alzheimer's disease; and the identification of HLA-B(*)5701 as a highly sensitive and specific predictive marker for abacavir treated patients who will develop hypersensitivity syndrome (HSS). The rosiglitazone study prevented pipeline attrition by changing the interpretation of a critical Phase IIB proof of concept study (2005) from a failed study, to a positive efficacy response in a genetically predictable proportion of patients. Now, three years later, a Phase III program of clinical trials using pharmacogenetic designs is months away from completion (late08). If successfully registered (early09), millions of patients could benefit, and efficacy PGX would have achieved its first prospective block-buster. The use of safety candidate gene association genetics in patients who received abacavir therapy and developed HSS starting in 1998 culminated in a double blind clinical trial that determined sensitivity > 97% and specificity >99% in 2007. Clinical consensus panels rapidly recommended abacavir as the preferred therapy along with HLA-B(*)5701 pre-testing, immediately increasing the market share of abacavir with respect to other reverse transcriptases that are associated with there own adverse events. Targeting of medicines during drug development is now possible, practical, and profitable."

By two-dimensional gel analysis, yeast forks pause at stable DNA protein complexes, and this pausing is greatly increased in the absence of the Rrm3 helicase. We used a genome-wide approach to identify 96 sites of very high DNA polymerase binding in wild-type cells. Most of these binding sites were not previously identified pause sites. Rather, the most highly represented genomic category among high DNA polymerase binding sites was the open reading frames (ORFs) of highly transcribed RNA polymerase II genes. Twice as many pause sites were identified in rrm3 compared with wild-type cells, as pausing in this strain occurred at both highly transcribed RNA polymerase II genes and the previously identified protein DNA complexes. ORFs of highly transcribed RNA polymerase II genes are a class of natural pause sites that are not exacerbated in rrm3 cells."

Among patients who initially respond to trastuzumab therapy, resistance typically arises within 1 year. BT/Her(R) cells are trastuzumab-resistant variants of Her2-positive BT474 breast cancer cells. The salient feature of BT/Her(R) cells is failure to downregulate phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt signaling on trastuzumab binding. The current work addresses the mechanism of sustained signaling in BT/Her(R) cells, focusing on the protein kinase A (PKA) pathway. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We performed microarray analysis on BT/Her(R) and BT474 cell lines to identify genes that were upregulated or downregulated in trastuzumab-resistant cells. Specific genes in the PKA pathway were quantified using reverse transcription-PCR and Western hybridization. Small interfering RNA transfection was used to determine the effects of gene knockdown on cellular response to trastuzumab. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were used to measure cyclic AMP-responsive element binding activity under defined conditions. Immunohistochemistry was used to analyze protein expression in clinical samples. RESULTS: BT/Her(R) cells had elevated PKA signaling activity and several genes in the PKA regulatory network had altered expression in these cells. Downregulation of one such gene, the PKA-RIIalpha regulatory subunit, conferred partial trastuzumab resistance in Her2-positive BT474 and SK-Br-3 cell lines. Forskolin activation of PKA also produced significant protection against trastuzumab-mediated Akt dephosphorylation. In patient samples, PKA signaling appeared to be enhanced in residual disease remaining after trastuzumab-containing neoadjuvant therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Activation of PKA signaling may be one mechanism contributing to trastuzumab resistance in Her2-positive breast cancer. We propose a molecular model by which PKA confers its effects."

The Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) is believed to regulate transcriptional repression by catalysing the di- and tri-methylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27me2/3). At present, it is unknown how the PcG proteins are recruited to their target promoters in mammalian cells. Here we show that PRC2 forms a stable complex with the Jumonji- and ARID-domain-containing protein, JARID2 (ref. 4). Using genome-wide location analysis, we show that JARID2 binds to more than 90% of previously mapped PcG target genes. Notably, we show that JARID2 is sufficient to recruit PcG proteins to a heterologous promoter, and that inhibition of JARID2 expression leads to a major loss of PcG binding and to a reduction of H3K27me3 levels on target genes. Consistent with an essential role for PcG proteins in early development, we demonstrate that JARID2 is required for the differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells. Thus, these results demonstrate that JARID2 is essential for the binding of PcG proteins to target genes and, consistent with this, for the proper differentiation of embryonic stem cells and normal development."

Previous reports suggested a dynamic modulation of the chromatin landscape during adipocyte differentiation. We thus hypothesized that PARP1 plays an important transcriptional role in adipogenesis and metabolism and therefore used adipocyte development and function as a model to elucidate the molecular action of PARP1 in obesity-related diseases. Our results show that PARP1-dependent ADP-ribose polymer (PAR) formation increases during adipocyte development and, at late time points of adipogenesis, is involved in the sustained expression of PPARgamma2 and of PPARgamma2 target genes. During adipogenesis, PARP1 was recruited to PPARgamma2 target genes such as CD36 or aP2 in a PAR-dependent manner. Our results also reveal a PAR-dependent decrease in repressory histone marks (e.g. H3K9me3) and an increase in stimulatory marks (e.g. H3K4me3) at the PPARgamma2 promoter, suggesting that PARP1 may exert its regulatory function during adipogenesis by altering histone marks. Interestingly, activation of PARP1 enzymatic activity was prevented with a topoisomerase II inhibitor. These data hint at topoisomerase II-dependent, transient, site-specific double-strand DNA breaks as the cause for poly(ADP)-ribose formation, adipogenic gene expression, and adipocyte function. Together, our study identifies PARP1 as a critical regulator of PPARgamma2-dependent gene expression with implications in adipocyte function and obesity-related disease models."

Nucleosomes can determine the underlying DNA methylation status. Herein, we show that the opposite is also true: DNA methylation can determine nucleosome positioning. Using a cancer model and digital nucleosome positioning techniques, we demonstrate that the induction of DNA hypomethylation events by genetic (DNMT1/DNMT3B deficient cells) or drug (a DNA demethylating agent) approaches is associated with the eviction of nucleosomes from previously hypermethylated CpG islands of tumor suppressor genes. Most importantly, the establishment of a stable cell line that restores DNMT1/DNMT3B deficiency shows that nucleosomes reoccupy their positions in de novo methylated CpG islands. Finally, we extend these results to the genomic level, combining a DNA methylation microarray and the nucleosome positioning technique. Using this global approach, we observe the dependency of nucleosome occupancy upon the DNA methylation status. Thus, our results suggest that there is a close association between hypermethylated CpG islands and the presence of nucleosomes, such that each of these epigenetic mechanisms can determine the recruitment of the other.

The present study evaluates whether periodontal treatment may affect serum antibodies to P. gingivalis and citrulline levels in relation to disease activity of RA. METHODS: Fifty-five patients with RA were randomly assigned to receive oral hygiene instruction and supragingival scaling (treatment group, n = 26) or no periodontal treatment (control group, n = 29). Periodontal and rheumatologic parameters and serum levels of cytokine and inflammatory markers citrulline and immunoglobulin (Ig)G to P. gingivalis were examined at baseline and 8 weeks later. RESULTS: Both groups did not differ statistically in any parameters except percentage of sites with probing depth and clinical attachment level >= 4 mm at baseline. The treatment group exhibited a significantly greater decrease in disease activity score including 28 joints using C-reactive protein (DAS28-CRP) (P = 0.02), serum levels of IgG to P. gingivalis hemin binding protein (HBP)35 (P = 0.04), and citrulline (P = 0.02) than the control group. Serum levels of IgG to P. gingivalis HBP35 were significantly correlated positively with those of anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies (P = 0.0002). The same correlation was obtained between serum levels of IgG to P. gingivalis-sonicated extracts and those of rheumatoid factor (P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that supragingival scaling decreases DAS28-CRP and serum levels of IgG to P. gingivalis HBP35 and citrulline in patients with RA. These observations may reflect a role of P. gingivalis in the protein citrullination, which is related to the pathogenesis of RA."

We used a lentiviral vector to transfer a functional ARSA gene into hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from three presymptomatic patients who showed genetic, biochemical, and neurophysiological evidence of late infantile MLD. After reinfusion of the gene-corrected HSCs, the patients showed extensive and stable ARSA gene replacement, which led to high enzyme expression throughout hematopoietic lineages and in cerebrospinal fluid. Analyses of vector integrations revealed no evidence of aberrant clonal behavior. The disease did not manifest or progress in the three patients 7 to 21 months beyond the predicted age of symptom onset. These findings indicate that extensive genetic engineering of human hematopoiesis can be achieved with lentiviral vectors and that this approach may offer therapeutic benefit for MLD patients. "

In afibrinogenemia and hypofibrinogenemia, most mutations of the FGA, FGB, or FGG fibrinogen encoding genes are null mutations. In some cases, missense or late truncating nonsense mutations allow synthesis of the corresponding fibrinogen chain but intracellular fibrinogen assembly and/or secretion are impaired. Afibrinogenemia is associated with mild-to-severe bleeding, whereas hypofibrinogenemia is most often asymptomatic. Thromboembolism may occur either spontaneously or in association with fibrinogen substitution therapy. Women with afibrinogenemia suffer from recurrent pregnancy loss but this can also occur in women with hypofibrinogenemia. Dysfibrinogenemia, caused mainly by missense mutations, is commonly associated with bleeding, thrombophilia, or both; however, most individuals are asymptomatic. Hypodysfibrinogenemia is a subcategory of this disorder. Even in specialized laboratories, the precise diagnosis of some fibrinogen disorders may be difficult. Determination of the molecular defects is important because it gives the possibility to confirm the diagnosis, to elaborate a diagnostic strategy, to distinguish in some cases that the patient is at risk of thrombosis rather than bleeding, and to enable prenatal diagnosis. However, genotype-phenotype correlations are not easy to establish. Replacement therapy is effective in treating bleeding episodes, but because the pharmacokinetics of fibrinogen after replacement therapy is highly variable among patients, it is important to adjust the treatment individually.

Three members of the family on three generations had typical multiple CCM lesions and no clinical signs related to CCM. No mutation was detected using genomic DNA sequencing and quantitative multiplex PCR of short fluorescent fragments (QMPSF). cDNA sequencing showed a 99-nucleotide insertion between exons 5 and 6 of CCM1, resulting from a mutation located deep into intron 5 (c.262+132_262+133del) that activates a cryptic splice site. This pseudoexon leads to a premature stop codon. These data highly suggest that deep intronic mutations explain part of the incomplete mutation detection rate in CCM patients and underline the importance of analyzing the cDNA to provide comprehensive CCM diagnostic tests.

PGRN mutations were identified in patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and recently its role as risk factor has been described in patients with probable Alzheimer's disease (AD). To date, more than 100 genetic variants in GRN gene have been described and the pathogenic nature is still unclear for almost 36% of them. OBJECTIVE: Here, we describe three clinical cases carrying the PGRN variation Cys139Arg in order to increase the knowledge on the association of this variant to the clinical spectrum of FTLD. METHODS: The genetic analysis was performed using high resolution melting analysis. The Human Progranulin ELISA Kit was used in order to determine PGRN expression levels in the plasma samples. RESULTS: The three patients carrying the genetic variation showed three final different clinical diagnosis, respectively behavioral frontotemporal dementia, semantic dementia, and corticobasal syndrome, thus underlining the clinical heterogeneity typically associated with GRN mutations. All cases shared similar plasma PGRN levels that resulted intermediate between those measured in controls and in GRN null mutation carriers, showing a partial reduction of the protein in plasma. Moreover, according to the bioinformatics software, the Cys139Arg variation causes a decreased stability of the structure of the protein. CONCLUSION: We describe three new patients affected by neurological syndromes included in the clinical spectrum of FTLD carrying the Cys139Arg genetic variant, thus suggesting a possible implication in the pathogenesis of FTLD."

DESIGN: Case series. PARTICIPANTS: Three hundred forty-seven unrelated families affected by arRP and 33 unrelated families affected by retinitis pigmentosa (RP) plus noncongenital and progressive hearing loss, ataxia, or both, respectively. METHODS: A whole exome sequencing (WES) analysis was performed in 2 families segregating arRP. A mutational screening was performed in 378 additional unrelated families for the exon-intron boundaries of the ABHD12 gene. To establish a genotype-phenotype correlation, individuals who were homozygous or compound heterozygotes of mutations in ABHD12 underwent exhaustive clinical examinations by ophthalmologists, neurologists, and otologists. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: DNA sequence variants, best-corrected visual acuity, visual field assessments, electroretinogram responses, magnetic resonance imaging, and audiography. RESULTS: After a WES analysis, we identified 4 new mutations (p.Arg107Glufs*8, p.Trp159*, p.Arg186Pro, and p.Thr202Ile) in ABHD12 in 2 families (RP-1292 and W08-1833) previously diagnosed with nonsyndromic arRP, which cosegregated with the disease among the family members. Another homozygous mutation (p.His372Gln) was detected in 1 affected individual (RP-1487) from a cohort of 378 unrelated arRP and syndromic RP patients. After exhaustive clinical examinations by neurologists and otologists, the 4 affected members of the RP-1292 had no polyneuropathy or ataxia, and the sensorineural hearing loss and cataract were attributed to age or the normal course of the RP, whereas the affected members of the families W08-1833 and RP-1487 showed clearly symptoms associated with polyneuropathy, hearing loss, cerebellar ataxia, RP, and early-onset cataract (PHARC) syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Null mutations in the ABHD12 gene lead to PHARC syndrome, a neurodegenerative disease including polyneuropathy, hearing loss, cerebellar ataxia, RP, and early-onset cataract. Our study allowed us to report 5 new mutations in ABHD12. This is the first time missense mutations have been described for this gene.

        "text": "Risk of diabetes in patients treated with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors.\nOBJECTIVE: 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) are used to control blood cholesterol levels and reduce cardiovascular disease. It has been repeatedly reported that statins may cause new-onset diabetes mellitus (DM). However, limited evidence exists from direct head to head comparisons of statins on whether the risk of DM differs among statins. We investigated the risk of development of new-onset diabetes in subjects treated with different statins. METHODS: We retrospectively enrolled consecutive 3680 patients without DM or impaired fasting glucose who started receiving statin treatment for cholesterol control. We evaluated the incidence of new-onset diabetes according to the type of statin. RESULTS: The mean duration of follow-up was 62.6+-15.3 months. The incidence of DM was significantly higher in the pitavastatin group (49 of 628; 7.8%) compared to that in the other statin groups [atorvastatin (68 of 1327; 5.1%), rosuvastatin (77 of 1191; 6.5%), simvastatin (11 of 326; 3.4%), and pravastatin (12 of 298; 5.8%); p=0.041]. The risk of diabetes was the highest in the pitavastatin group compared with that in the simvastatin group [hazard ratio (HR)=2.68, p=0.011]. Other statins showed no significant risk differences compared to that for simvastatin. Fasting blood glucose (FBG) level at baseline and body-mass index (BMI) were associated with the development of diabetes [FBG, HR=1.11, p<0.001; BMI, HR=1.02, p=0.005]. CONCLUSIONS: Among the five statins, pitavastatin showed the strongest effect on the development of new-onset diabetes."

Therefore, drugs targeting autophagy are promising in the management of malignant gliomas. In this study, we investigated the anti-glioma potential of curcumin in vitro, and further examined the molecular mechanisms of curcumin-induced cell death in human malignant glioma. Here, we provide evidence that curcumin is cytotoxic against human malignant glioma cell lines, and the mechanism of cell death caused by curcumin is associated with features of autophagy. Curcumin suppresses the growth of human malignant glioma cells via ROS-dependent prostate apoptosis response-4 (Par-4) induction and ceramide generation. Extracellular supplementation of antioxidants such as glutathione and N-acetylcysteine to glioma cells abrogated the Par-4 induction, ceramide generation, and in turn, prevented curcumin-induced autophagic cell death. Moreover, tumor cells transfected with Par-4 gene sensitized the curcumin-induced autophagic cell death. Overall, this study describes a novel signaling pathway by which curcumin induces ROS-dependent Par-4 activation and ceramide generation, leading to autophagic cell death in human malignant glioma cells.

Adenosine deaminases that act on RNA (ADARs) catalyze the adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) conversion, the most common type of RNA editing in higher eukaryotes. Caenorhabditis elegans has two ADARs, ADR-1 and ADR-2, but their functions remain unclear. Here, we profiled the RNA editomes of C. elegans at different developmental stages of wild-type and ADAR mutants. We developed a new computational pipeline with a \"bisulfite-seq-mapping-like\" step and achieved a threefold increase in identification sensitivity. A total of 99.5% of the 47,660 A-to-I editing sites were found in clusters. Of the 3080 editing clusters, 65.7% overlapped with DNA transposons in noncoding regions and 73.7% could form hairpin structures. The numbers of editing sites and clusters were highest at the L1 and embryonic stages. The editing frequency of a cluster positively correlated with the number of editing sites within it. Intriguingly, for 80% of the clusters with 10 or more editing sites, almost all expressed transcripts were edited. Deletion of adr-1 reduced the editing frequency but not the number of editing clusters, whereas deletion of adr-2 nearly abolished RNA editing, indicating a modulating role of ADR-1 and an essential role of ADR-2 in A-to-I editing. Quantitative proteomics analysis showed that adr-2 mutant worms altered the abundance of proteins involved in aging and lifespan regulation. Consistent with this finding, we observed that worms lacking RNA editing were short-lived. Taken together, our results reveal a sophisticated landscape of RNA editing and distinct modes of action of different ADARs. "

The length of the expanded polyQ stretch correlates positively with the severity of the disease and inversely with the age at onset. To date, we cannot fully explain the mechanism underlying neurobiological abnormalities of this disease. Yet, accumulating reports have demonstrated the functions of ataxin-3 protein in the chaperone system, ubiquitin-proteasome system, and aggregation-autophagy, all of which suggest a role of ataxin-3 in the clearance of misfolded proteins. Notably, the SCA3 pathogenic form of ataxin-3 (ataxin-3(exp)) impairs the misfolded protein clearance via mechanisms that are either dependent or independent of its deubiquitinase (DUB) activity, resulting in the accumulation of misfolded proteins and the progressive loss of neurons in SCA3. Some drugs, which have been used as activators/inducers in the chaperone system, ubiquitin-proteasome system, and aggregation-autophagy, have been demonstrated to be efficacious in the relief of neurodegeneration diseases like Huntington's disease (HD), Parkinson's (PD), Alzheimer's (AD) as well as SCA3 in animal models and clinical trials, putting misfolded protein clearance on the list of potential therapeutic targets. Here, we undertake a comprehensive review of the progress in understanding the physiological functions of ataxin-3 in misfolded protein clearance and how the polyQ expansion impairs misfolded protein clearance. We then detail the preclinical studies targeting the elimination of misfolded proteins for SCA3 treatment. We close with future considerations for translating these pre-clinical results into therapies for SCA3 patients. "

Co-occurrence of acetylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27ac) and mono methylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me1) has been widely used for identification of active enhancers. However, increasing evidence suggests that using this combination of marks alone for enhancer identification gives an incomplete picture of the active enhancer repertoire. We have shown that the H3 globular domain acetylations, H3K64ac and H3K122ac, and an H4 tail acetylation, H4K16ac, are enriched at active enhancers together with H3K27ac, and also at a large number of enhancers without detectable H3K27ac. We propose that acetylations at these lysine residues of histones H3 and H4 might function by directly affecting chromatin structure, nucleosome-nucleosome interactions, nucleosome stability, and transcription factor accessibility."

Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) is known for its function in nuclear DNA repair. In this study, we have employed genetic deletion and chemical inhibition approaches to determine the role of PARP1 in maintaining mtDNA dependent mitochondrial function in Chagas disease. Our data show that expression of PARP1 and protein PARylation were increased by >2-fold and >16-fold, respectively, in the cytosolic, nuclear, and mitochondrial fractions of the human cardiac myocytes and the myocardium of wildtype (WT) mice chronically infected with T. cruzi. The nuclear and cytosolic PARP1/PAR did not interfere with the transcription and translation of the components of the mtDNA replisome machinery in infected cardiomyocytes and chagasic murine myocardium. However, PARP1 binding to Polymerase gamma and mtDNA in mitochondria were increased, and associated with a loss in mtDNA content, mtDNA-encoded gene expression, and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) capacity, and an increase in mitochondrial ROS production in cells and heart of WT mice infected with T. cruzi. Subsequently, an increase in oxidative stress, and cardiac collagen deposition, and a decline in LV function was noted in chagasic mice. Genetic deletion of PARP1 or treatment with selective inhibitor of PARP1 (PJ34) improved the mtDNA content, mitochondrial function, and oxidant/antioxidant balance in human cardiomyocytes and chronically infected mice. Further, PARP1 inhibition was beneficial in preserving the cardiac structure and left ventricular function in chagasic mice. We conclude that PARP1 overexpression is associated with a decline in Pol gamma-dependent maintenance of mtDNA content, mtDNA-encoded gene expression, and mitochondrial respiratory function, and subsequently contributes to an increase in mtROS and oxidative stress in chagasic myocardium. Inhibition of mitochondrial PARP1/PAR offers a novel therapy in preserving the mitochondrial and LV function in chronic Chagas disease."

While inflammation is present at all stages of MS, it is more pronounced in the relapsing forms of the disease, whereas progressive MS (PMS) shows significant neuroaxonal damage and grey and white matter atrophy. Hence, disease-modifying treatments beneficial in patients with relapsing MS have limited success in PMS. BAF312 (siponimod) is a novel sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulator shown to delay progression in PMS. Besides reducing inflammation by sequestering lymphocytes in lymphoid tissues, BAF312 crosses the blood-brain barrier and binds its receptors on neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. To evaluate potential direct neuroprotective effects, BAF312 was systemically or locally administered in the CNS of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis mice with distinct grey- and white-matter lesions (focal experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis using an osmotic mini-pump). Ex-vivo flow cytometry revealed that systemic but not local BAF312 administration lowered immune cell infiltration in animals with both grey and white matter lesions. Ex-vivo voltage-sensitive dye imaging of acute brain slices revealed an altered spatio-temporal pattern of activation in the lesioned cortex compared to controls in response to electrical stimulation of incoming white-matter fiber tracts. Here, BAF312 administration showed partial restore of cortical neuronal circuit function. The data suggest that BAF312 exerts a neuroprotective effect after crossing the blood-brain barrier independently of peripheral effects on immune cells. Experiments were carried out in accordance with German and EU animal protection law and approved by local authorities (Landesamt fur Natur, Umwelt und Verbraucherschutz Nordrhein-Westfalen; 87-51.04.2010.A331) on December 28, 2010."

It is estimated that congenital fibrinogen disorder accounts for 8% of rare coagulation factor deficiencies. Most of congenital fibrinogen disorders are suspected in individuals with bleeding tendency or coincidentally discovered, for instance prior to surgery. Fibrinogen disorders could be also found in patients with thrombotic events, impaired wound healing, and recurrent spontaneous abortions. Afibrinogenemia manifests as mild to severe bleeding, while hypofibrinogenemia is often asymptomatic. Dysfibrinogenemia, a qualitative fibrinogen disorder, is associated with bleeding, thrombosis, or with no symptoms. Recent recommendations issued by the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis in 2018 do not encourage routine evaluation of thrombin time or other coagulation tests in patients with suspected congenital fibrinogen disorders, highlighting the value of fibrinogen antigen measurement and genetic analysis, added to the key finding, that is, reduced fibrinogen concentration determined with a coagulometric assay.

Infections may result from ingestion of contaminated food, inhalation of spores into the nares or lungs, or inoculation into disrupted skin or wounds. In developed countries, mucormycosis occurs primarily in severely immunocompromised hosts (e.g., those with hematological malignancies, organ transplantation, neutropenia, autoimmune disorders, or other impairments in immunity). Only 6 to 10% of cases occur in subjects with no underlying disease. In contrast, in developing countries, most cases of mucormycosis occur in persons with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus or in immunocompetent subjects following trauma. Mucormycosis exhibits a marked propensity to invade blood vessels, leading to thrombosis, necrosis, and infarction of tissue. Mortality associated with invasive mucormycosis is high (> 30-50%), with 90% mortality associated with disseminated disease. Mortality rates are much lower, though still significant (10-30%), among patients with localized cutaneous disease.The diagnosis of mucormycosis relies upon histopathology and culture. Blood tests are of limited diagnostic value. Even with disseminated disease, blood cultures are usually negative. Mucorales have a distinct histological appearance, with irregular, nonseptate hyphae that branch at right angles. Cultures and/or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are important to identify the genera.Based on anatomic localization, mucormycosis can be classified as one of six forms: (1) rhino-orbital-cerebral mucormycosis (ROCM), (2) pulmonary, (3) cutaneous, (4) gastrointestinal (GI), (5) disseminated, and (6) mucormycosis of uncommon sites. Among diabetics, ROCM is the most common clinical presentation, whereas lung involvement is uncommon. In contrast, among organ transplant recipients or patients with hematological malignancies (HemeM), pulmonary and disseminated diseases are most common. Mucormycosis can progress rapidly, and delay in initiation of treatment by even a few days markedly worsens outcomes.Due to the rarity of mucormycosis, randomized controlled therapeutic trials have not been performed. Lipid formulations of amphotericin B (LFAB) are the mainstay of therapy, but the newer triazoles, posaconazole (POSA) and isavuconazole (ISAV) (the active component of the prodrug isavuconazonium sulfate), may be effective in patients refractory to or intolerant of LFAB. Early surgical debridement or excision plays an important adjunctive role. Additional studies are required to assess the optimal duration of therapy as well as the specific roles of LFAB and the triazoles in the treatment of mucormycosis."

These proteins bind to adenine uridine-rich element (ARE) in the 3'untranslated region of target messenger RNA and stimulate target degradation. ZFP36 functions as an anti-inflammatory modulator in murine models of inflammatory diseases by down-regulating the production of inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha. However, how ZFP36L1 and ZFP36L2 alter the function of CD4+ T cells is not completely understood. We addressed this issue by searching for the target genes of ZFP36L2 by comprehensive transcriptome analysis. We observed that ZFP36L2 is highly expressed in naive CD4+ T cells; however, when CD4+ T cells are stimulated through their T cell receptors, ZFP36L2 expression is rapidly reduced in both humans and mice. Among CD4+ T cell populations, the expression levels of ZFP36L2 in regulatory T cells (Tregs) were significantly lower than those in naive or effector CD4+ T cells. RNA-sequence analysis revealed that the forced expression of ZFP36L2 decreased Ikzf2 (encoding Helios) expression in Foxp3+ Tregs and inhibited the ability of induced Tregs (iTregs). ZFP36L2 directly bound to and destabilized the 3'untranslated region of Ikzf2 mRNA, which contains AU-rich elements. These results indicate that ZFP36L2 reduces the expression of Ikzf2 and suppresses iTreg function, raising the interesting possibility that the inhibition of ZFP36L2 in iTregs could be a therapeutic strategy for autoimmune diseases."

Here, we show that TLK loss results in severe chromatin decompaction and altered genome accessibility, particularly affecting heterochromatic regions. Failure to maintain heterochromatin increases spurious transcription of repetitive elements and induces features of alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT). TLK depletion culminates in a cGAS-STING-TBK1-mediated innate immune response that is independent of replication-stress signaling and attenuated by the depletion of factors required to produce extra-telomeric DNA. Analysis of human cancers reveals that chromosomal instability correlates with high TLK2 and low STING levels in many cohorts.

In addition, the local recurrence and distant metastasis of AB also sometimes occurs, which resembles one of the typical malignant potentials. From these points of view, to understand better the mechanisms of AB cell migration or invasion is necessary for the better clinical therapy and improvements of the patients' quality of life. Microtubules in eukaryotic cells reveal the shape of hollow cylinders made up of polymerized alpha (alpha)- and beta (beta)-tubulin dimers and form the cytoskeleton together with microfilaments and intermediate filaments.

Curcumin, as a traditional Chinese medicine extract with anti-tumor and anti-inflammatory effects, can affect the development of diverse human diseases including cancer. The aim of this research was to probe the mechanism by which curcumin regulates colon cancer progression. Colon cancer cells were processed with graded concentrations of curcumin. The proliferation and apoptosis of the treated cells were determined by MTT, colony formation assay and flow cytometry. Expression of signaling pathway-related proteins and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) was measured by western blotting. The effect of curcumin on tumor cell growth was verified through T cell-mediated killing and ELISA assays. The relationship between target gene expression and the survival rate of colon cancer patients was analyzed by a survival curve. Curcumin treatment restrained proliferation and accelerated apoptosis of colon cancer cells. It elevated miR-206 expression, which in turn affected colon cancer cell function. miR-206 enhanced colon cancer cell apoptosis and inhibited PD-L1 expression; thus, curcumin enhanced the killing effect of T cells on tumor cells by suppressing PD-L1 through inhibiting the JAK/STAT3 pathway. Patients with high expression of miR-206 had better survival rates than those with low expression. Curcumin can regulate miR-206 expression and inhibit the malignant behavior of colon cancer cells and enhance T cell killing through the JAK/STAT3 pathway."

European Union (EU) Collaborative Study Group of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD).\nBACKGROUND: Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy. Genetic and iatrogenic forms have been recognised but most are sporadic and of unknown cause. We have studied risk factors for CJD as part of the 1993-95 European Union collaborative studies of CJD in Europe. METHODS: The 405 patients with definite or probable CJD who took part in our study had taken part in population-based studies done between 1993 and 1995 in Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and the UK. Data on putative risk factors from these patients were compared with data from 405 controls. FINDINGS: We found evidence for familial aggregation of CJD with dementia due to causes other than CJD (relative risk [RR] 2.26, 95% CI 1.31-3.90). No significant increased risk of CJD in relation to a history of surgery and blood transfusion was shown. There was no evidence for an association between the risk of CJD and the consumption of beef, veal, lamb, cheese, or milk. No association was found with occupational exposure to animals or leather. The few positive findings of the study include increased risk in relation to consumption of raw meat (RR 1.63 [95% CI 1.18-2.23]) and brain (1.68 [1.18-2.39]), frequent exposure to leather products (1.94 [1.13-3.33]), and exposure to fertiliser consisting of hoofs and horns (2.32 [1.38-2.91]). Additional analyses, for example stratification by country and of exposures pre-1985 and post-1985, suggest that these results should be interpreted with great caution. INTERPRETATION: Within the limits of the retrospective design of the study, our findings suggest that genetic factors other than the known CJD mutations may play an important part in CJD. Iatrogenic transmission of disease seems rare in this large population-based sample of patients with CJD. There is little evidence for an association between the risk of CJD and either animal exposure, or consumption of processed bovine meat or milk products for the period studied."

A method to image apoptosis in vivo, rather than requiring histologic evaluation of tissue, could assist with therapeutic decision making in these disorders. Programmed cell death is associated with a well-choreographed series of events resulting in the cessation of normal cell function, and the ultimate disappearance of the cell. One component of apoptosis is signaling adjacent cells that this cell is committing suicide by externalizing phosphatidylserine to the outer leaflet of the cell membrane. Annexin V, a 32-kDa endogenous human protein, has a high affinity for membrane-bound phosphatidylserine. We have coupled annexin V with the bifunctional hydrazinonicotinamide reagent (HYNIC) to prepare technetium-99m HYNIC-annexin V and demonstrated localization of radioactivity in tissues undergoing apoptosis in vivo. In this report we describe the results of a series of experiments in mice and rats to characterize the biologic behavior of (99m)Tc-HYNIC- annexin V. Biodistribution studies were performed in groups of rats at 10-180 min after intravenous injection of (99m)Tc-HYNIC-annexin V. In order to estimate the degree of apoptosis required for localization of (99m)Tc-annexin V in vivo, mice were treated with dexamethasone at doses ranging from 1 to 20 mg/kg, 5 h prior to (99m)Tc-HYNIC-annexin V administration, to induce thymic apoptosis. Thymus was excised 1 h after radiolabeled HYNIC-annexin V injection; thymocytes were isolated, incubated with Hoechst 33342 followed by propidium iodide, and analyzed on a fluorescence-activated cell sorter. Each sorted cell population was counted in a scintillation counter. To test (99m)Tc-HYNIC-annexin V as a tracer for external radionuclide imaging of apoptotic cell death, radionuclide imaging of Fas-defective mice (lpr/lpr mice) and wild-type mice treated with the antibody to Fas (anti-Fas) was carried out 1 h post injection. Rat biodistribution studies demonstrated a blood clearance half-time of less than 10 min for (99m)Tc-HYNIC-annexin V. The kidneys had the highest concentration of radioactivity at all time points. Studies in the mouse thymus demonstrated a 40-fold increase in (99m)Tc-HYNIC-annexin V concentration in apoptotic thymocytes compared with the viable cell population. A correlation of r=0.78 was found between radioactivity and flow cytometric and histologic evidence of apoptosis. Imaging studies in the lpr/lpr and wild-type mice showed a substantial increase of activity in the liver of wild-type mice treated with anti-Fas, while there was no significant change, irrespective of anti-Fas administration, in lpr/lpr mice. Excellent images of hepatic apoptosis were obtained in wild-type mice 30 min after injection of (99m)Tc-HYNIC-annexin V. The imaging results were consistent with histologic analysis in these animals. In conlusion, these studies confirm the value of (99m)Tc-HYNIC-annexin V uptake as a marker for the detection and quantification of apoptotic cells in vivo."

Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured in 20 white, premenopausal women with prolactinoma and in 60 healthy control white women, using quantitative ultrasound (QUS) at the os calcis, with an Achilles Lunar Plus device. We measured all three parameters of QUS: broadband ultrasound attenuation (BUA), speed of sound (SOS) and stiffness. BMD results were expressed also as T- and Z-scores. Age and body mass index (BMI) were not statistically significantly different between the two groups. Comparative analysis showed reduced values of QUS parameters in women with prolactinoma versus controls. Only the difference in SOS parameter was statistically significant between the two studied groups (p = 0.0001). The Z-score was significant lower in women with prolactinoma than in healthy women. These data reveal a significant bone loss in women with prolactinoma compared to controls. The SOS parameter showed a good negative correlation with age, and all the QUS parameters were positively correlated with BMI. The relative risk for developing osteoporosis in women with prolactinoma was found to be 4.5, indicating that hyperprolactinemia in women is a major risk factor for osteoporosis."

Despite the use of advanced imaging facilities, modern antibiotic therapy and aggressive neurosurgical protocols, this condition still carries significant morbidity and mortality. CASE REPORT: We report an unusual case of sinusitis-associated acute subdural empyema in a 13-year-old patient, presenting in a catastrophic manner with acutely raised intracranial pressure. Emergency bifrontal decompressive craniectomy was necessary both to reduce the intracranial pressure and to drain the subdural empyema. RESULTS: The full range of intracranial complications subsequently occurred, including brain abscesses, recurrent subdural empyema and ventriculitis. Despite this, the patient's outcome was good, with minimal intellectual deficits. CONCLUSION: In cases of severe intracranial infection, we therefore advocate an aggressive surgical approach coupled with appropriate antibiotics to ensure a good outcome."

These two orders produce dramatically different infections. Genera from the order Mucorales (Rhizopus, Mucor, Rhizomucor, Absidia, Apophysomyces, Cunninghamella and Saksenaea) cause an angioinvasive infection called mucormycosis. Mucormycosis presents with rhino-orbito-cerebral, pulmonary, disseminated, cutaneous, or gastrointestinal involvement. Immunocompromising states such as haematological malignancy, bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell transplantation, neutropenia, solid organ transplantation, diabetes mellitus with or without ketoacidosis, corticosteroids, and deferoxamine therapy for iron overload predispose patients to infection. Mucormycosis in immunocompetent hosts is rare, and is often related to trauma. Mortality rates can approach 100% depending on the patient's underlying disease and form of mucormycosis. Early diagnosis, along with treatment of the underlying medical condition, surgery, and an amphotericin B product are needed for a successful outcome. Genera from the order Entomophthorales produce a chronic subcutaneous infection called entomophthoramycosis in immunocompetent patients. This infection occurs in tropical and subtropical climates. The genus Basidiobolus typically produces a chronic subcutaneous infection of the thigh, buttock, and/or trunk. Rarely, it has been reported to involve the gastrointestinal tract. The genus Conidiobolus causes a chronic infection of the nasal submucosa and subcutaneous tissue of the nose and face. This paper will review the clinical manifestations, diagnosis and treatment of mucormycosis and entomophthoramycosis."

One example of the regulatory, rather than proteolytic, function of ubiquitin is provided by study of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor (TRAF) proteins, which function as ubiquitin ligases to synthesize lysine 63 (K(63))-linked polyubiquitin chains to mediate protein kinase activation through a proteasome-independent mechanism. Some TRAF proteins, such as TRAF2 and TRAF3, have recently been shown to have a positive role in the canonical pathway that activates nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) through IkappaB kinase beta (IKKbeta), but a negative role in the noncanonical pathway that activates NF-kappaB through IKKalpha. These opposing roles of TRAF proteins may be linked to their ability to synthesize distinct forms of polyubiquitin chains. Indeed, the TRAF2-interacting protein RIP can mediate IKK activation when it is modified by K(63) polyubiquitin chains, but is targeted to degradation by the proteasome when it is K(48)-polyubiquitinted by the NF-kappaB inhibitor A20. Thus, ubiquitin chains are dynamic switches that can influence signaling outputs in dramatically different ways."

The gene responsible for the phenotype was mapped to chromosome 7q31 and identified as the FOXP2 gene, coding for a transcription factor containing a polyglutamine tract and a forkhead DNA-binding domain. Because of linkage studies implicating 7q31 in autism, where language impairment is a component of the disorder, and in specific language impairment, FOXP2 has also been considered as a potential susceptibility locus for the language deficits in autism and/or specific language impairment. In this study, we characterized mice with a disruption in the murine Foxp2 gene. Disruption of both copies of the Foxp2 gene caused severe motor impairment, premature death, and an absence of ultrasonic vocalizations that are elicited when pups are removed from their mothers. Disruption of a single copy of the gene led to modest developmental delay but a significant alteration in ultrasonic vocalization in response to such separation. Learning and memory appear normal in the heterozygous animals. Cerebellar abnormalities were observed in mice with disruptions in Foxp2, with Purkinje cells particularly affected. Our findings support a role for Foxp2 in cerebellar development and in a developmental process that subsumes social communication functions in diverse organisms."

This review focuses on the current knowledge of associations between polymorphisms and treatment outcomes in HIV with particular emphasis on clinically relevant relationships likely to lead to the individualization of antiretroviral therapy. RECENT FINDINGS: Our understanding of the immunogenetic basis of drug toxicity has been furthered by human leucocyte antigen associations with hypersensitivities for the antiretroviral drugs abacavir and nevirapine. For abacavir in particular, the use of HLA-B*5701 as a screening test appears to be generalizable across racially diverse populations and has been supported by both observational, and blinded randomized controlled trials. SUMMARY: Differences in HIV acquisition and progression as well as antiretroviral efficacy and toxicity will continue to provide the basis for research to define the genetic basis of such diversity. Despite the plethora of research in this area, numerous barriers exist to the successful operationalization of genetic testing to the clinic. HLA-B*5701 screening to prevent abacavir hypersensitivity is currently the most relevant to clinical practice and highlights that the promise of cost-effective testing can be facilitated by robust laboratory methodology and quality assurance programs that can be applied to diverse treatment settings."

Widely used tools for prediction of mortality are fundamentally limited in that they do not account for effects of withdrawal of care and are not designed to predict functional recovery. We developed an acute clinical score to predict likelihood of functional independence. METHODS: We prospectively characterized 629 consecutive patients with ICH at hospital presentation. Predictors of functional independence (Glasgow Outcome Score > or = 4) at 90 days were used to develop a logistic regression-based risk stratification scale in a random subset of two thirds and validated in the remaining one third of the cohort. RESULTS: At 90 days, 162 (26%) patients achieved independence. Age, Glasgow Coma Scale, ICH location, volume (all P<0.0001), and pre-ICH cognitive impairment (P=0.005) were independently associated with Glasgow Outcome Score > or = 4. The FUNC score was developed as a sum of individual points (0-11) based on strength of association with outcome. In both the development and validation cohorts, the proportion of patients who achieved Glasgow Outcome Score > or = 4 increased steadily with FUNC score. No patient assigned a FUNC score < or = 4 achieved functional independence, whereas > 80% with a score of 11 did. The predictive accuracy of the FUNC score remained unchanged when restricted to ICH survivors only, consistent with absence of confounding by early withdrawal of care. CONCLUSIONS: FUNC score is a valid clinical assessment tool that identifies patients with ICH who will attain functional independence and thus, can provide guidance in clinical decision-making and patient selection for clinical trials."

Among many genetic lesions, mutational inactivation of p53 tumor suppressor, the \"guardian of the genome,\" is the most frequent event found in 50% of human cancers. p53 plays a critical role in tumor suppression mainly by inducing growth arrest, apoptosis, and senescence, as well as by blocking angiogenesis. In addition, p53 generally confers the cancer cell sensitivity to chemoradiation. Thus, p53 becomes the most appealing target for mechanism-driven anticancer drug discovery. This review will focus on the approaches currently undertaken to target p53 and its regulators with an overall goal either to activate p53 in cancer cells for killing or to inactivate p53 temporarily in normal cells for chemoradiation protection. The compounds that activate wild type (wt) p53 would have an application for the treatment of wt p53-containing human cancer. Likewise, the compounds that change p53 conformation from mutant to wt p53 (p53 reactivation) or that kill the cancer cells with mutant p53 using a synthetic lethal mechanism can be used to selectively treat human cancer harboring a mutant p53. The inhibitors of wt p53 can be used on a temporary basis to reduce the normal cell toxicity derived from p53 activation. Thus, successful development of these three classes of p53 modulators, to be used alone or in combination with chemoradiation, will revolutionize current anticancer therapies and benefit cancer patients."

However, the relative contribution of selenoproteins and small Se compounds in cancer protection is still a matter of debate. The tumor suppressor p53 is the most frequently mutated gene in human cancer and is often referred to as the \"guardian of the genome\".

They are, however, extremely important, playing key roles in several cell functions and bacterial pathogenicity. TMBBs are included in the lipid bilayer with a beta-barrel structure and are presently found in the outer membranes of Gram-negative bacteria, mitochondria and chloroplasts. Recently, we developed two top-performing methods based on machine-learning approaches to tackle both the detection of TMBBs in sets of proteins and the prediction of their topology. Here, we present our BETAWARE program that includes both approaches and can run as a standalone program on a linux-based computer to easily address in-home massive protein annotation or filtering.

        "text": "Coenzyme Q10 ameliorates the reduction in GLUT4 transporter expression induced by simvastatin in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.\nBACKGROUND: Statins significantly reduce cardiovascular events in a broad population of patients with hyperlipidemia. However, a small, but significant risk of new-onset diabetes has been reported in patients treated with statins. The mechanism by which statins cause diabetes has not been elucidated and therefore preventive strategies have yet to be defined. METHOD: Our goal was to study the differing effects of a lipophilic (simvastatin) statin, hydrophilic (pravastatin) statin, and ezetimibe on glucose transporter-4 (GLUT4) protein expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. We hypothesized that the reductions in GLUT4 protein secondary to statin treatment would be prevented when cells were co-incubated with coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10). GLUT4 protein expression was determined using the In-Cell Western technique. Confluent adipocytes were differentiated using a hormonal cocktail for 3 days; followed by treatment with simvastatin, pravastatin, ezetimibe and CoQ10. Cell morphology was observed after treatment using phase-contrast microscopy. RESULTS: Treatment with simvastatin (P<0.001) and simvastatin plus ezetimibe (P<0.001) significantly decreased GLUT4 protein expression in the adipocytes compared to control conditions. GLUT4 protein levels were similar to control after treatment with ezetimibe alone (P=0.52) or pravastatin (P=0.32). There was no significant difference (P=0.098) in GLUT4 protein levels after co-treatment with CoQ10 between any of the treatments and control conditions. CONCLUSION: Our studies have shown that lipophilic statins (simvastatin) reduce the GLUT4 protein levels in adipocytes, whereas hydrophilic statins (pravastatin) or ezetimibe do not. Co-treatment with CoQ10 appears to prevent the reduction in GLUT4 protein levels caused by simvastatin."

Testing >20 human lymphoma and leukemia B cell lines, we found that most can be transdifferentiated at least partially into macrophage-like cells, provided that C/EBPalpha is expressed at sufficiently high levels. A tamoxifen-inducible subclone of the Seraphina Burkitt lymphoma line, expressing C/EBPalphaER, could be efficiently converted into phagocytic and quiescent cells with a transcriptome resembling normal macrophages. The converted cells retained their phenotype even when C/EBPalpha was inactivated, a hallmark of cell reprogramming. Interestingly, C/EBPalpha induction also impaired the cells' tumorigenicity. Likewise, C/EBPalpha efficiently converted a lymphoblastic leukemia B cell line into macrophage-like cells, again dramatically impairing their tumorigenicity. Our experiments show that human cancer cells can be induced by C/EBPalpha to transdifferentiate into seemingly normal cells at high frequencies and provide a proof of principle for a potential new therapeutic strategy for treating B cell malignancies."

It is characterized by the development of multiple, benign tumors in several organs throughout the body. Lesions occur in the brain, kidneys, heart, liver, lungs, and skin and result in seizures and epilepsy, mental retardation, autism, and renal and pulmonary organ system dysfunction, as well as other complications. Elucidation of the molecular pathways and etiological factors responsible for causing TSC has led to a paradigm shift in the management and treatment of the disease. TSC1 or TSC2 mutations lead to constitutive upregulation of the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway, which affects many cellular processes involved in tumor growth. By targeting mammalian target of rapamycin with everolimus, an orally active rapamycin derivative, clinically meaningful and statistically significant reductions in tumor burden have been achieved for the main brain (subependymal giant cell astrocytoma) and renal manifestations (angiomyolipoma) associated with TSC. This review provides an overview of TSC, everolimus, and the clinical trials that led to its approval for the treatment of TSC-associated subependymal giant cell astrocytoma and renal angiomyolipoma.

Dabigatran is an oral direct thrombin inhibitor which has been approved for prophylaxis of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. The use of dabigatran etexilate increased rapidly due to many benefits. However, questions have been raised constantly regarding the safety of dabigatran etexilate. Case. A 58-year-old Caucasian male with a history of recurrent paroxysmal atrial fibrillation status after pacemaker and end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis came to the Emergency Department with the complaint of severe epistaxis. He had been started on dabigatran 150 mg twice a day about 4 months ago as an outpatient by his cardiologist. His prothrombin time (PT) was 63 seconds with international normalized ratio (INR) of 8.8 and his activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) was 105.7 seconds. Otherwise, all labs were unremarkable including the liver function test. Dabigatran was stopped immediately. His INR and aPTT trended downward, reaching normal levels 5 days after admission. Conclusion. Dabigatran is contraindicated in patients with severe kidney insufficiency as it is predominantly excreted via the kidney (~80%). Elderly patients over 75 and patients with chronic renal impairment should be carefully evaluated before starting dabigatran. Despite studies showing only mild increase in aPTT and PT/INR in patients receiving dabigatran, close monitoring may be reasonable in patients with renal insufficiency. "

This study sought to investigate whether lower levels of kidney function were associated with prevalent or incident frailty in Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) participants. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: CHS enrolled community-dwelling adults age >=65 years between 1989-1990 and 1992-1993. To examine prevalent frailty, included were 4150 participants without stroke, Parkinson disease, prescribed medications for Alzheimer disease or depression, or severely impaired cognition. To examine incident frailty, included were a subset of 3459 participants without baseline frailty or development of exclusion criteria during follow-up. The primary predictor was estimated GFR (eGFR) calculated using serum cystatin C (eGFR(cys)). Secondary analyses examined eGFR using serum creatinine (eGFR(SCr)). Outcomes were prevalent frailty and incident frailty at 4 years of follow-up. Frailty was ascertained on the basis of weight loss, exhaustion, weakness, slowness, and low physical activity. RESULTS: The mean age was 75 years and the median eGFR(cys) was 73 ml/min per 1.73 m(2). Among participants with an eGFR(cys) <45 ml/min per 1.73 m(2), 24% had prevalent frailty. In multivariable analysis and compared with eGFR(cys) >=90 ml/min per 1.73 m(2), eGFR(cys) categories of 45-59 (odds ratio [OR], 1.80; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.17 to 2.75) and 15-44 (OR, 2.87; 95% CI, 1.72 to 4.77) were associated with higher odds of frailty, whereas 60-75 (OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.76 to 1.70) was not. In multivariable analysis, eGFR(cys) categories of 60-75 (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 1.72; 95% CI, 1.07 to 2.75) and 15-44 (IRR, 2.28; 95% CI, 1.23 to 4.22) were associated with higher incidence of frailty whereas 45-59 (IRR, 1.53; 95% CI, 0.90 to 2.60) was not. Lower levels of eGFR(SCr) were not associated with higher risk of prevalent or incident frailty. CONCLUSIONS: In community-dwelling elders, lower eGFR(cys) was associated with a higher risk of prevalent and incident frailty whereas lower eGFR(SCr) was not. These findings highlight the importance of considering non-GFR determinants of kidney function."

Recently we published the initial subset of imaging findings for specific regions in a cohort of individuals with autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease. We now extend this work to include a larger cohort, whole-brain analyses integrating all three imaging modalities, and longitudinal data to examine regional differences in imaging biomarker dynamics. The anatomical distribution of imaging biomarkers is described in relation to estimated years from symptom onset. Autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease mutation carrier individuals have elevated PiB levels in nearly every cortical region 15 y before the estimated age of onset. Reduced cortical glucose metabolism and cortical thinning in the medial and lateral parietal lobe appeared 10 and 5 y, respectively, before estimated age of onset. Importantly, however, a divergent pattern was observed subcortically. All subcortical gray-matter regions exhibited elevated PiB uptake, but despite this, only the hippocampus showed reduced glucose metabolism. Similarly, atrophy was not observed in the caudate and pallidum despite marked amyloid accumulation. Finally, before hypometabolism, a hypermetabolic phase was identified for some cortical regions, including the precuneus and posterior cingulate. Additional analyses of individuals in which longitudinal data were available suggested that an accelerated appearance of volumetric declines approximately coincides with the onset of the symptomatic phase of the disease.

However, their efficacy may be limited by immunosuppressive elements in the immune system and tumor microenvironment. Therefore, strategies to reverse the effects of the immunosuppressive elements are needed. We observed that regulatory T cells (Tregs) were increased in the peripheral blood at diagnosis and persisted in high numbers after induction of clinical remission with a cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin-containing chemotherapy regimen in FL patients. High levels of peripheral blood Tregs prior to therapy were associated with decreased progression-free survival in FL patients treated with either chemotherapy or combination immunotherapy that targeted CD20 and PD-1 with monoclonal antibodies rituximab and pidilizumab, respectively. Intratumoral and peripheral blood Tregs potently suppressed autologous antitumor effector T cells in FL. However, the effects of FL Tregs could be reversed by triggering Toll-like receptors (TLR) with TLR ligands Pam3 CSK4 (TLR 1/2), flagellin (TLR 5), and CpG-B (TLR 9), and/or OX40. The TLR ligands synergized with each other as well as OX40 signaling to inhibit Tregs. Furthermore, they restored the function of FL tumor-specific effector T cells. Our results suggest that a state of tolerance exists in FL patients at diagnosis and after induction of clinical remission, and agents that activate TLRs 1/2, 5, and 9, and OX40 may serve as adjuvants to enhance the efficacy of antitumor immunotherapeutic strategies and preventive vaccines against infectious diseases in these patients."

Physical activity has been demonstrated to improve health-related quality of life in several patient populations with chronic disease. There are very few studies investigating the effects of physical activity on health-related quality of life in inflammatory bowel disease. The primary purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of 10 weeks of moderate physical activity on health-related quality of life in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: Thirty patients with mild to moderate IBD (Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) <220 or Rachmilewitz Index (RI) <11) were randomized 1:1 to either supervised moderate-intensity running thrice a week for 10 weeks or a control group who were not prescribed any exercise. Health-related quality of life, symptoms, and inflammation were assessed at baseline and after 10 weeks. RESULTS: Participants were 41 +- 14 years (73% female), had a body mass index of 22.8 +- 4.1 kg/m(2), and an average CDAI or RI of 66.8 +- 42.4 and 3.6 +- 3.1. No adverse events occurred during the 10-week training period. Health-related quality of life, reported as IBDQ total score, improved 19% in the intervention group and 8% in the control group. Scores for the IBDQ social sub-scale were significantly improved in the intervention group compared with controls (DeltaIBDQsocial = 6.27 +- 5.46 vs. 1.87 +- 4.76, p = 0.023). CONCLUSION: Patients suffering from moderately active IBD are capable of performing symptom-free regular endurance exercise. Our data support the assumption that PA is feasible in IBD patients. PA may furthermore improve quality of life through improvements in social well-being, and may, therefore, be a useful adjunct to IBD therapy."

METHODS: Randomized, double-blind, first-in-human study of bimekizumab in 39 subjects who received single-dose intravenous bimekizumab (8-640 mg) or placebo (NCT02529956). RESULTS: Bimekizumab demonstrated dose-proportional linear PK and was tolerated across the dose range assessed. No subject discontinued due to treatment-emergent adverse events and no severe adverse events were reported. Bimekizumab demonstrated fast onset of clinically-meaningful effects on skin of patients with mild psoriasis as early as Week 2. Maximal improvements (100% or near 100% reductions from baseline) in all measures of disease activity were observed between Weeks 8-12 in subjects receiving 160-640 mg bimekizumab. The duration of effect at doses >=160 mg was evident up to Weeks 12-20 after a single intravenous dose, dependent on endpoint. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to demonstrate the safety, tolerability and clinical efficacy of a dual IL-17A and IL-17F inhibitor, in subjects with mild psoriasis. Bimekizumab showed fast onset of clinically-meaningful efficacy by Week 2, with a maximal or near-maximal magnitude of response that was maintained up to study Weeks 12-20. These findings support the continued clinical development of bimekizumab for diseases mediated by both IL-17A and IL-17F, including psoriasis."

OBJECTIVE: To determine the evolution of IMHs after long-term follow-up and to identify the predictive factors of IMH outcomes in the Chinese population. METHODS: A total of 123 IMH patients with clinical and imaging follow-up data were retrospectively studied. The primary endpoints were aortic disease-related death, aortic dissection, penetrating aortic ulcer (PAU), thickening of the aortic hematoma and aortic complications requiring surgical or endovascular treatment. RESULTS: All 123 IMH patients were monitored clinically. The follow-up duration ranged from 1.4 to 107 months (median, 20 months). Thirty-nine patients had type A IMH, and 84 had type B. The multivariate analysis showed that a baseline MAD >= 44.75 mm (2.9% vs 61.4%, P < 0.001) and acute PAUs (2.9% vs 34.1%, P = 0.008) were independent predictors of aorta-related events.

The interaction of lymphocytes with endothelial cells and platelets, termed thromboinflammation, fosters microvascular dysfunction and secondary infarct growth. Siponimod is an S1PR (sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor) modulator, which blocks the egress of lymphocytes from lymphoid organs and has demonstrated beneficial effects in multiple sclerosis treatment. We investigated the effect of treatment with siponimod on stroke outcome in a mouse model of cerebral ischemia. Methods- Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion was induced in middle-aged wild-type mice. Animals were either treated with siponimod (3 mg/kg; intraperitoneal) or vehicle for 6 days. Stroke outcome was assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (spleen volume: prestroke, day 3, and day 7; infarct volume: days 1, 3, and 7) and behavioral tests (prestroke, day 2, and day 6). Immune cells of the peripheral blood and brain-infiltrating cells ipsilateral and contralateral were analyzed by VETScan and by flow cytometry. Results- Siponimod significantly induced lymphopenia on day 7 after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion and reduced T-lymphocyte accumulation in the central nervous system. No effect was detected for lesion size. Conclusions- For siponimod administered at 3 mg/kg in transient middle cerebral artery occlusion mouse model, our findings do not provide preclinical evidence for the use of S1PR1/5 modulators as neuroprotectant in stroke therapy."

A single mutation in the human GRN gene resulting in reduced PGRN expression causes types of frontotemporal lobar degeneration resulting in frontotemporal dementia. Prosaposin (PSAP) is also a multifunctional neuroprotective secreted protein and regulator of lysosomal function. Interactions of PGRN and PSAP affect their functional properties. Their roles in Alzheimer's disease (AD), the leading cause of dementia, have not been defined. In this report, we examined in detail the cellular expression of PGRN in middle temporal gyrus samples of a series of human brain cases (n = 45) staged for increasing plaque pathology. Immunohistochemistry showed PGRN expression in cortical neurons, microglia, cerebral vessels and amyloid beta (Abeta) plaques, while PSAP expression was mainly detected in neurons and Abeta plaques, and to a limited extent in astrocytes. We showed that there were increased levels of PGRN protein in AD cases and corresponding increased levels of PSAP. Levels of PGRN and PSAP protein positively correlated with amyloid beta (Abeta), with PGRN levels correlating with phosphorylated tau (serine 205) levels in these samples. Although PGRN colocalized with lysosomal-associated membrane protein-1 in neurons, most PGRN associated with Abeta plaques did not. Abeta plaques with PGRN and PSAP deposits were identified in the low plaque non-demented cases suggesting this was an early event in plaque formation. We did not observe PGRN-positive neurofibrillary tangles. Co-immunoprecipitation studies of PGRN from brain samples identified only PSAP associated with PGRN, not sortilin or other known PGRN-binding proteins, under conditions used. Most PGRN associated with Abeta plaques were immunoreactive for PSAP showing a high degree of colocalization of these proteins that did not change between disease groups. As PGRN supplementation has been considered as a therapeutic approach for AD, the possible involvement of PGRN and PSAP interactions in AD pathology needs to be further considered."

Bimekizumab is a monoclonal IgG1 antibody that selectively inhibits interleukin (IL)-17F in addition to IL-17A. We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of bimekizumab with placebo and ustekinumab in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis over 52 weeks. METHODS: BE VIVID was a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, active comparator and placebo controlled phase 3 trial done across 105 sites (clinics, hospitals, research units, and private practices) in 11 countries in Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America. Adults aged 18 years or older with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (Psoriasis Area and Severity Index [PASI] score >=12, >=10% body surface area affected by psoriasis, and Investigator's Global Assessment [IGA] score >=3 on a five point scale) were included. Randomisation was stratified by geographical region and previous exposure to biologics; patients, investigators, and sponsors were masked to treatment assignment. Patients were randomly assigned (4:2:1) using an interactive response technology to bimekizumab 320 mg every 4 weeks, ustekinumab 45 mg or 90 mg (baseline weight-dependent dosing) at weeks 0 and 4, then every 12 weeks, or placebo every 4 weeks. At week 16, patients receiving placebo switched to bimekizumab 320 mg every 4 weeks. All study treatments were administered as two subcutaneous injections. Coprimary endpoints were the proportion of patients with 90% improvement in the PASI (PASI90) and the proportion of patients with an IGA response of clear or almost clear (score 0 or 1) at week 16 (non-responder imputation). Efficacy analyses included the intention-to-treat population; safety analysis included patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. This trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03370133 (completed). FINDINGS: Between Dec 6, 2017, and Dec 13, 2019, 735 patients were screened and 567 were enrolled and randomly assigned (bimekizumab 320 mg every 4 weeks n=321, ustekinumab 45 mg or 90 mg every 12 weeks n=163, placebo n=83). At week 16, 273 (85%) of 321 patients in the bimekizumab group had PASI90 versus 81 (50%) of 163 in the ustekinumab group (risk difference 35 [95% CI 27-43]; p<0 0001) and four (5%) of 83 in the placebo group (risk difference 80 [74-86]; p<0 0001). At week 16, 270 (84%) patients in the bimekizumab group had an IGA response versus 87 (53%) in the ustekinumab group (risk difference 30 [95% CI 22-39]; p<0 0001) and four (5%) in the placebo group (risk difference 79 [73-85]; p<0 0001). Over 52 weeks, serious treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in 24 (6%) of 395 patients in the bimekizumab group (including those who switched from placebo at week 16) and 13 (8%) of 163 in the ustekinumab group. INTERPRETATION: Bimekizumab was more efficacious than ustekinumab and placebo in the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. The bimekizumab safety profile was consistent with that observed in previous studies. FUNDING: UCB Pharma."

Heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding the progranulin protein (Granulin Precursor, GRN) are a common cause of familial frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Gene therapy approaches that aim to increase progranulin expression from a single wild-type allele, an area of active investigation for the potential treatment of GRN-dependent FTD, will benefit from the availability of a mouse model that expresses a genomic copy of the human GRN gene. Here we report the development and characterization of a novel mouse model that expresses the entire human GRN gene in its native genomic context as a single copy inserted into a defined locus (Hprt) in the mouse genome. We show that human and mouse progranulin are expressed in a similar tissue-specific pattern, suggesting that the two genes are regulated by similar mechanisms. Human progranulin rescues a phenotype characteristic of progranulin-null mice, the exaggerated and early deposition of the aging pigment lipofuscin in the brain, indicating that the two proteins are functionally similar. Longitudinal behavioural and neuropathological analyses revealed no significant differences between wild-type and human progranulin-overexpressing mice up to 18 months of age, providing evidence that long-term increase of progranulin levels is well tolerated in mice. Finally, we demonstrate that human progranulin expression can be increased in the brain using an antisense oligonucleotide that inhibits a known GRN-regulating micro-RNA, demonstrating that the transgene is responsive to potential gene therapy drugs. Human progranulin-expressing mice represent a novel and valuable tool to expedite the development of progranulin-modulating therapeutics."

Besides their impact on genome size, TEs are also functionally important as they can alter gene expression and influence phenotypic variation. In plants, most top-down studies focus on extremely clear phenotypes such as the shape or the color of individuals and do not explore fully the role of TEs in evolution. Assessing the impact of TEs in a more systematic manner, however, requires identifying active TEs to further study their impact on phenotypes. In this chapter, we describe an in planta approach that consists in activating TEs by interfering with pathways involved in their silencing. It enables to directly investigate the functional impact of single TE families at low cost."

Among these newfound roles, the relationship between MITF and aging is attractive; however, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Here, we review the documented cues that highlight the implication of MITF in the aging process and particularly discuss the possible mechanisms underlying the participation of MITF in cellular senescence. First, it summarizes the association of MITF with melanocytic senescence, including the roles of MITF in cell cycle regulation, DNA damage repair, oxidative stress response, and the generation of senescence-associated secretory phenotype. Then, it collects the information involving MITF-related senescent changes in nonmelanocytes, such as retinal pigment epithelium cells, osteoclasts, and cardiomyocytes. This review may deepen the understanding of MITF function and be helpful to develop new strategies for improving geriatric health."

Melanin-producing melanocytes maintain a gene expression program ensuring appropriate enzymatic conversion of metabolites into the pigment, melanin, and transfer to surrounding cells. During neuroectodermal development, SMARCA4 (BRG1), the catalytic subunit of SWItch/Sucrose Non-Fermentable (SWI/SNF) chromatin remodeling complexes, is essential for lineage specification. SMARCA4 is also required for development of multipotent neural crest precursors into melanoblasts, which differentiate into pigment-producing melanocytes. In addition to the catalytic domain, SMARCA4 and several SWI/SNF subunits contain bromodomains which are amenable to pharmacological inhibition. We investigated the effects of pharmacological inhibitors of SWI/SNF bromodomains on melanocyte differentiation. Strikingly, treatment of murine melanoblasts and human neonatal epidermal melanocytes with selected bromodomain inhibitors abrogated melanin synthesis and visible pigmentation. Using functional genomics, iBRD9, a small molecule selective for the bromodomain of BRD9 was found to repress pigmentation-specific gene expression. Depletion of BRD9 confirmed a requirement for expression of pigmentation genes in the differentiation program from melanoblasts into pigmented melanocytes and in melanoma cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that iBRD9 disrupts the occupancy of BRD9 and the catalytic subunit SMARCA4 at melanocyte-specific loci. These data indicate that BRD9 promotes melanocyte pigmentation whereas pharmacological inhibition of BRD9 is repressive."

Objective: To identify factors associated with screening for T1D prevention trials. Methods: This study included TrialNet Pathway to Prevention participants who were eligible for a prevention trial: oral insulin (TN-07, TN-20), teplizumab (TN-10), abatacept (TN-18), and oral hydroxychloroquine (TN-22). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to examine participant, site, and study factors at the time of prevention trial accrual. Results: Screening rates for trials were: 50% for TN-07 (584 screened/1172 eligible), 9% for TN-10 (106/1249), 24% for TN-18 (313/1285), 17% for TN-20 (113/667), and 28% for TN-22 (371/1336). Younger age and male sex were associated with higher screening rates for prevention trials overall and for oral therapies. Participants with an offspring with T1D showed lower rates of screening for all trials and oral drug trials compared with participants with other first-degree relatives as probands. Site factors, including larger monitoring volume and US site vs international site, were associated with higher prevention trial screening rates. Conclusions: Clear differences exist between participants who screen for prevention trials and those who do not screen and between the research sites involved in prevention trial screening. Participant age, sex, and relationship to proband are significantly associated with prevention trial screening in addition to key site factors. Identifying these factors can facilitate strategic recruitment planning to support rapid and successful enrollment into prevention trials."

A review of safety considerations.\nThe sedative thalidomide was withdrawn from the market 30 years ago because of its teratogenic and neurotoxic adverse effects. The compound was later discovered to be extremely effective in the treatment of erythema nodosum leprosum, a complication of lepromatous leprosy. This effect is probably due to a direct influence on the immune system, because thalidomide possesses no antibacterial activity. The compound is presently used as an experimental drug in the treatment of a variety of diseases with an autoimmune character, including recurrent aphthosis of nonviral and nonfungal origin in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients. This article reviews the most important chemical and pharmacokinetic properties of thalidomide. The possible mechanisms of the nonsedative effects of thalidomide with respect to the safety of its use in HIV patients are discussed. Because the mechanism of the immunomodulatory effect of thalidomide is unknown, the possibility that the administration of this compound will accelerate the deterioration of the immunological status of HIV patients cannot be excluded. Clinical evidence suggests that thalidomide may aggravate the condition of patients with preexisting peripheral neuropathy. Hypersensitivity reactions to thalidomide may occur more frequently in HIV patients than in other patient groups. Because of the teratogenic activity of thalidomide, reliable contraception must be provided to female patients of childbearing age. Before the introduction of thalidomide therapy to an HIV patient presenting with oral ulcers, a fungal or viral origin of the lesions should be excluded. Thalidomide should not be used in patients with preexisting HIV-related peripheral polyneuropathy, polyradiculopathy or encephalopathy. In patients experiencing a complete remission, the discontinuation of thalidomide treatment and its reintroduction in the case of a relapse are preferable to maintenance therapy."

CASE REPORT: In a 57-year-old female patient, who was admitted with fluctuating central neurological abnormalities and generalized purpura, was made the diagnosis of a thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP, Moschcowitz' syndrome). On admission there were a distinct anemia and thrombocytopenia. Corresponding to the hemolysis the laboratory findings showed raised reticulocytes and elevated LDH with > 900 U/l. The peripheral blood smear showed an enrichment of fragmented red cells (15%) and the bone marrow indicated a hyperplastic erythrocytopoesis and a left shift in megakaryocytopoesis. An increase of eosinophilic granulocytes and the tissue basophilic cells directed to a possible allergic phenomenon of the underlying disease. Until 3 weeks before admission she had been on ticlopidine after a left heart catheter with stenting the left coronary artery 6 weeks earlier. Beside taking of acetylsalicylacid and thyroid hormone there was no other regular medication. An early treatment with fresh frozen plasma and plasmapheresis with plasma exchange with fresh frozen plasma led directly to an elevation of thrombocytes and a normalization of hemolytic parameters. CONCLUSION: This case demonstrates the possible relationship between thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and the administration of ticlopidine."

Stabilization of the RNA transcripts for these genes, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), is an important molecular pathway for this up-regulation. HuR, a member of the Elav family of RNA-binding proteins, has been implicated in this pathway through its binding to adenine and uridine (AU)-rich stability elements (ARE) located in the 3' untranslated regions (3'-UTRs) of the mRNA. Whereas three of the Elav family members (Hel-N1, HuC, and HuD) are restricted to young and mature neurons, HuR is more broadly expressed, including proliferating cells of the developing CNS. Because RNA stabilization of labile genes may promote tumor growth, we analyzed and compared the expression pattern of HuR in 35 freshly resected and cultured CNS tumors to determine whether there was any correlation with tumor grade or histological type. We found that HuR mRNA was consistently expressed in all of the tumors, regardless of cell origin or degree of malignancy. Using a novel HuR-specific polyclonal antibody, we found that strong HuR protein expression was limited to high-grade malignancies (glioblastoma multiforme and medulloblastoma). Within the glioblastoma multiforme, prominent HuR expression was also detected in perinecrotic areas in which angiogenic growth factors are up-regulated. To further define its role as a potential RNA stabilizer, we analyzed whether HuR could bind to the stability motifs within the 3'-UTRs of cytokines and growth factors linked to brain tumor progression. We used a novel ELISA-based RNA binding assay and focused on the 3'-UTRs of angiogenic factors VEGF, COX-2, and (interleukin) IL-8 as well as the immunomodulating factors IL-6, transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha as potential RNA ligands. Our results indicated overall a very high binding affinity to these RNA targets. A comparison of these ligands revealed a hierarchy of binding affinities with the angiogenic factors, and TGF-beta showing the highest (Kd of 1.8-3.4 nM), and TNF-alpha the lowest (Kd of 18.3 nM). The expression pattern of HuR, coupled with the RNA binding data, strongly suggests a role for this protein in the posttranscriptional regulation of these genes in CNS tumors."

A meta-analysis was performed statistically pooling all available observational studies on this topic in order to evaluate this suspected association. METHODS: Using previously described methods, a protocol was developed for a meta-analysis examining the association between maternal smoking during pregnancy and subsequent development of primary brain tumors in their offspring. Literature search techniques, study inclusion criteria and statistical procedures were prospectively defined. Data from epidemiological studies were pooled using a general variance-based meta-analytic method employing confidence intervals previously described by Greenland. The outcome of interest was a summary relative risk (RRs) reflecting the risk of childhood brain tumor development associated with mother's smoking during the index pregnancy. Sensitivity analyses were performed when necessary to explain any observed statistical heterogeneity and/or to evaluate the impact of demographic or study characteristics on the summary estimate of effect. RESULTS: Twelve observational studies meeting protocol specified inclusion criteria were obtained via a comprehensive literature search. These studies enrolled a total of 6566 patients. Analysis for homogeneity demonstrated that the data were homogeneous (P > 0.50) and could be statistically combined. Pooling all twelve reports yielded an RRs of 1.05 (0.90-1.21), a non-statistically significant result suggesting no clear association between maternal smoking during pregnancy and risk of childhood brain tumor development. Numerous sensitivity analyses examining the possible effect of study design and various patient characteristics failed to show any influence on the RRs further supporting the observed lack of association. CONCLUSION: The available epidemiological data do not support a clear association between maternal smoking during pregnancy and pediatric brain tumor development. Although it appears likely that no association exists, limitations in study designs limit definitive conclusions based on available data."

In patients with cavernomas, constitutional mutations of the KRIT1 gene have been identified. The pathogenetic mechanisms leading to cerebral cavernous malformations (CCM) development are poorly understood. CCM development might be induced in utero owing to the underlying KRIT1 defect, and is triggered by environmental factors. Another model suggests that CCM develop according to the two-hit model of tumorigenesis associated with biallelic inactivation of KRIT1. So far, CCM specimens themselves have not been subjected to mutation analysis. We identified two somatic mutations in the cavernoma of a sporadic case, suggesting that pathogenesis is associated with somatic KRIT1 alterations. To gain a better understanding of the role of KRIT1 during morphogenesis, the main goal of this study was to provide a detailed description of the spatio-temporal expression pattern of Krit1 and its interaction partner Rap1A during mouse embryogenesis. We did not observe enhanced expression of either gene in the heart or large vessels; however, their expression in the developing small vessels or capillaries could not be assessed by the methods applied. At early embryonic stages, Krit1 and, to a lesser extent, Rap1A are expressed in the developing nervous system. During later phases of fetal development, specific expression of both genes is observed in regions of ossification, the dermis, tendons and in the meninges. These findings provide evidence of differential Krit1 and Rap1A expression during mouse ontogenesis and suggest a more widespread functional significance of Krit1, not restricted to vascular endothelial cells."

Since some patients with DBA develop a reduction in thrombocytes and granulocytes with age, we asked whether multipotent hematopoietic progenitors from DBA patients had normal proliferative capacity in liquid expansion cultures. CD34(+) cells derived from DBA patients showed deficient proliferation in liquid culture containing IL-3, IL-6, and SCF. Single CD34(+) CD38(-) cells from DBA patients exhibited deficient proliferation recruitment in a limiting dilution assay containing IL-3, IL-6, SCF, Tpo, FL, and G-CSF or containing IL-3, IL-6, and SCF. Our findings suggest that the underlying hematopoietic defect in DBA may not be limited to the erythroid lineage. Since a fraction of DBA patients have a deficiency in ribosomal protein S19 (RPS19), we constructed lentiviral vectors containing the RPS19 gene for overexpression in hematopoietic progenitors from RPS19-deficient DBA patients. Enforced expression of the RPS19 transgene improved the proliferation of CD34(+) cells from DBA patients with RPS19 mutation. Similarly, enforced expression of RPS19 improved erythroid development of RPS19-deficient hematopoietic progenitors as determined by colony assays and erythroid differentiation cultures.

A certain, though according to several case series, variable percentage of patients with clinically diagnosed TTP and most patients with other forms of thrombotic icroangiopathies (TMA) do not show severe ADAMTS-13 deficiency. METHODS: We determined ADAMTS-13 activity in 508 plasma samples of 309 patients referred to our laboratory in 2001 and 2002. Plasma samples with ADAMTS-13 activity <5% were additionally tested for the presence of inhibitory antibodies. Patients were assigned to ten predefined clinical categories according to information provided in the referral letter (TMA not specified; TMA associated with neoplasia or chemotherapy; TMA following haematopoietic stem cell transplantation; TMA with additional disorder; idiopathic TTP; haemolytic-uraemic syndrome (HUS) not specified; HUS with diarrhoea prodrome; atypical HUS; other haematological disorder; no clinical information available). RESULTS: We detected 50 (16%) patients with severe ADAMTS-13 deficiency. Forty-four (88%) of these patients had been classified as idiopathic TTP, 2 as neoplasia- or chemotherapy-associated, and 4 as non-specified TMA. Among the patients labelled as acute idiopathic TTP, the prevalence of severe ADAMTS-13 deficiency was 63% (44/70). Inhibitory antibodies were found in 31 (62%) patients with ADAMTS-13 activity <5%. Of the 44 patients with acute idiopathic TTP, at initial presentation or at relapse, with ADAMTS-13 activity <5%, 11 were identified to have (probable) constitutional severe ADAMTS-13 deficiency. CONCLUSION: Severe ADAMTS-13 deficiency is found in about 60% of patients diagnosed with idiopathic TTP but in none of 111 diagnosed with HUS. Plasma ADAMTS-13 activity <5%, however, does not identify all patients clinically diagnosed with TTP. Detection of inhibitory antibodies against ADAMTS-13 helps to differentiate between acquired and constitutional forms of TTP, which may be important for treatment strategies."

We previously demonstrated that the dual specificity phosphatases (DSPs) MKP7 and M3/6 bind the scaffold JNK-interacting protein-1 (JIP-1) and inactivate the bound subset of JNK (1). The G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) adaptor beta-arrestin 2 is also a JNK3 scaffold. It binds the upstream kinases ASK1 and MKK4 and couples stimulation of the angiotensin II receptor AT1aR to activation of a cytoplasmic pool of JNK3. Here we report that MKP7 also binds beta-arrestin 2 via amino acids 394-443 of MKP7, the same region that interacts with JIP-1. This region of MKP7 interacts with beta-arrestin 2 at a central region near the JNK binding domain. MKP7 dephosphorylates JNK3 bound to beta-arrestin 2, either following activation by ASK1 overexpression or following AT1aR stimulation. Initial AT1aR stimulation causes a rapid (within 5 min) dissociation of MKP7 from beta-arrestin 2. MKP7 then reassociates with beta-arrestin 2 on endocytic vesicles 30-60 min after initial receptor stimulation. This dynamic interaction between phosphatase and scaffold permits signal transduction through a module that binds both positive and negative regulators."

RNA polymerase II synthesizes pre-mRNAs whose 5'-cap structures are scavenged by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase during synthesis of viral mRNAs. Drugs that inhibit RNAP-II therefore block viral replication, but not necessarily solely by denying the viral polymerase a source of cap-donor molecules. We show here that 5,6-dichloro-1-beta-D-ribofuranosyl-benzimidazole (DRB), a compound that prevents processive transcription by RNAP-II, inhibits expression of the viral HA, M1 and NS1 genes at the post-transcriptional level. Abundant quantities of functionally and structurally intact viral mRNAs are made in the presence of DRB but with the exception of NP and NS2 mRNAs, are not efficiently translated. Taking M1 and NP mRNAs as representatives of DRB-sensitive and insensitive mRNAs, respectively, we found that the block to translation operates at the level of nuclear export. Furthermore, removal of DRB reversed this block unless a variety of chemically and mechanistically distinct RNAP-II inhibitors were added instead. We conclude that influenza A virus replication requires RNAP-II activity not just to provide capped mRNA substrates but also to facilitate nuclear export of selected viral mRNAs."

Tpl2(-/-) macrophages have abrogated TNF production but overproduce IL-12 in response to TLR ligands. Despite enhanced IL-12 production, Tpl2(-/-) T cells have impaired IFN-gamma production. Therefore, the role of Tpl2 in a bona fide bacterial infection where all of these cytokines are important in host defense is unclear. To address this issue, we infected Tpl2(-/-) mice with the model pathogen Listeria monocytogenes. We found that Tpl2(-/-) mice infected i.v. with L. monocytogenes had increased pathogen burdens compared with wild-type mice and rapidly succumbed to infection. Enhanced susceptibility correlated with impaired signaling through TLR2 and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 2, two receptors previously shown to mediate Listeria recognition. Surprisingly, TNF production in response to infection was not significantly impaired, even though Tpl2 has been implicated in the regulation of TNF. We found that the role of Tpl2 has cell-type specific effects in regulating TNF and transduces signals from some, but not all, pattern recognition receptors (PRR). In contrast to the cell-type- and receptor-specific regulation of TNF, we found that Tpl2 is essential for IL-1beta production from both macrophages and dendritic cells. These studies implicate Tpl2 as an important mediator for collaboration of pattern recognition receptors with danger-associated molecular patterns to induce TNF and IL-1beta production and optimal host defense."

The chemopreventive agent curcumin has known antioxidant and tumor cell radiosensitizing properties. Its usefulness in preventing radiation-induced pneumonopathy has not been tested previously. We evaluated dietary curcumin in radiation-induced pneumonopathy and lung tumor regression in a murine model. Mice were given 1% or 5% (w/w) dietary curcumin or control diet prior to irradiation and for the duration of the experiment. Lungs were evaluated at 3 weeks after irradiation for acute lung injury and inflammation by evaluating bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid content for proteins, neutrophils and at 4 months for pulmonary fibrosis. In a separate series of experiments, an orthotopic model of lung cancer using intravenously injected Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells was used to exclude possible tumor radioprotection by dietary curcumin. In vitro, curcumin boosted antioxidant defenses by increasing heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) levels in primary lung endothelial and fibroblast cells and blocked radiation-induced generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Dietary curcumin significantly increased HO-1 in lungs as early as after 1 week of feeding, coinciding with a steady-state level of curcumin in plasma. Although both 1% and 5% w/w dietary curcumin exerted physiological changes in lung tissues by significantly decreasing LPS-induced TNF-alpha production in lungs, only 5% dietary curcumin significantly improved survival of mice after irradiation and decreased radiation-induced lung fibrosis. Importantly, dietary curcumin did not protect LLC pulmonary metastases from radiation killing. Thus dietary curcumin ameliorates radiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis and increases mouse survival while not impairing tumor cell killing by radiation."

Enzymatic citrullination abolishes positive charges of native protein molecules, inevitably causing significant alterations in their structure and functions. Citrullinated protein has an important physiological purpose; the formation of a cornified layer of skin that covers the human body. Despite this beneficial function, citrullinated protein also has a negative side, because this protein's accumulation in the brain is a possible cause of Alzheimer's disease. In the present review, we introduce PAD and their protein citrullination function, now considered critical for advancing research on aging and disease."

Commonly referred as a \"guardian of the genome\", p53 is responsible for determining the fate of the cell when the integrity of its genome is damaged. The development of tumors requires breaching this defense line. All known tumor cells either mutate the p53 gene, or in a similar number of cases, use internal cell p53 modulators, Mdm2 and Mdmx proteins, to disable its function. The release of functional p53 from the inhibition by Mdm2 and Mdmx should in principle provide an efficient, nongenotoxic means of cancer therapy. In recent years substantial progress has been made in developing novel p53-activating molecules thanks to several reported crystal structures of Mdm2/x in complex with p53-mimicking peptides and nonpeptidic drug candidates. Understanding the structural attributes of ligand binding holds the key to developing novel, highly effective, and selective drug candidates. Two low-molecular-weight compounds have just recently progressed into early clinical studies."

The expression and activity of ADAM17 increase under some pathological conditions such as stroke and cancer. ADAM17 promotes neural progenitor cell migration and contributes to neurogenesis after stroke and breast cancer growth and invasion. In the present study, we sought to elucidate whether ADAM17 contributes to glioma progression. To this end, we examined the role of ADAM17 in the proliferation, invasion, and tube formation of U87 human glioma cells in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Stable transfection of the U87 cell line with either a plasmid for over-expression of human ADAM17, or a siRNA to ADAM17 was employed in this study to establish high- or low-ADAM17 expression in glioma cells, respectively. For study of mechanism, the ADAM17 inhibitor TAPI-2 and the PI3K-AKT inhibitor LY294002 were used to counteract high-ADAM17 expression and the activated PI3K-AKT pathway, respectively. Proliferation of glioma cells were tested by thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, bromodeoxyuridine incorporation assay, growth curve, and sulforhodamine B assay. Matrigel invasion assays were used to assess the ability of U87 cells to penetrate the extracellular matrix (ECM). A Matrigel tube formation assay was performed to test capillary tube formation ability. EGFR-PI3K-Akt pathway activation in U87 cells under different ADAM17 expression levels were tested by Western blot. Our data show that ADAM17 promotes the U87 malignant phenotype by increased proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis, and in vivo tumor growth. Tumor growth in nude mice was significantly inhibited by ADAM17 inhibitor and A17-shRNA in vivo transfection. TGF-alpha, VEGF secretion, and VEGF expression was increased by ADAM17 and counteracted by ADAM17 siRNA, TAPI-2, and LY294002 in U87 cells. ADAM17 activated, whereas ADAM17 siRNA, TAPI-2, and LY294002 deactivated the EGFR-PI3K-AKT signal pathway, which correlated with U87 cell malignant phenotype changes. This study suggests ADAM17 contributes to glioma progression through activation of the EGFR-PI3K-AKT signal pathway."

Based on the clinical trials, this study evaluated the medical costs for clinical events among NVAF patients >=75 and <75 years of age treated with individual OACs vs warfarin. METHODS: Rates for primary and secondary efficacy and safety outcomes (i.e., clinical events) among NVAF patients receiving warfarin or each of the OACs were determined for NVAF populations aged >=75 years and <75 years of age from the OAC vs warfarin trials. One-year incremental costs among patients with clinical events were obtained from published literature and inflation adjusted to 2010 costs. Medical costs, excluding medication costs, for clinical events associated with each OAC and warfarin were then estimated and compared. RESULTS: Among NVAF patients aged >=75, compared to warfarin, use of either apixaban or rivaroxaban was associated with a reduction in medical costs per patient year (apixaban = -$825, rivaroxaban =-$23), while dabigatran use was associated with increased medical costs of $180 per patient year. Among NVAF patients <75 years of age medical costs per patient year were estimated to be reduced -$254, -$367, and -$88, for apixaban, dabigatran, and rivaroxaban, respectively, in comparison to warfarin. LIMITATIONS: This economic analysis was based on clinical trial data and, therefore, the direct application of the results to routine clinical practice will require further assessment. CONCLUSIONS: Difference in medical costs between OAC and warfarin treated NVAF patients vary by age group and individual OACs. Although reductions in medical costs for NVAF patients aged >=75 and <75 were observed for those using either apixaban or rivaroxaban vs warfarin, the reductions were greater per patient year for both the older and younger NVAF populations using apixaban."

It has been proven that defects of ribosomal proteins can lead to this disease and that RPS19 is the most frequently mutated gene in DBA patients. Previous studies suggest that p53-dependent genes and pathways play important roles in RPS19-deficient embryos. However, whether there are other vital factors linked to DBA has not been fully clarified. In this study, we compared the whole genome RNA-Seq data of zebrafish embryos injected with RPS19 morpholino (RPS19 MO), RPS19 and p53 morpholino simultaneously (RPS19+p53 MO) and control morpholino (control). We found that genes enriched in the functions of hematological systems, nervous system development and skeletal and muscular disorders had significant differential expression in RPS19 MO embryos compared with controls. Co-inhibition of p53 partially alleviates the abnormalities for RPS19-deficient embryos. However, the hematopoietic genes, which were down-regulated significantly in RPS19 MO embryos, were not completely recovered by the co-inhibition of p53. Furthermore, we identified the genome-wide p53-dependent and -independent genes and pathways. These results indicate that not only p53 family members but also other factors have important impacts on RPS19-deficient embryos. The detection of potential pathogenic genes and pathways provides us a new paradigm for future research on DBA, which is a systematic and complex hereditary disease. "

This is advantageous when equal amounts of gene products are required. Production of protein complexes with an uneven stoichiometry, however, requires tuning mechanisms to generate subunits in appropriate relative quantities. Using comparative genomic analysis, we show that differential translation is a key determinant of modulated expression of genes clustered in operons and that codon bias generally is the best in silico indicator of unequal protein production. Variable ribosome density profiles of polycistronic transcripts correlate strongly with differential translation patterns. In addition, we provide experimental evidence that de novo initiation of translation can occur at intercistronic sites, allowing for differential translation of any gene irrespective of its position on a polycistronic messenger. Thus, modulation of translation efficiency appears to be a universal mode of control in bacteria and archaea that allows for differential production of operon-encoded proteins."

In this study we investigated the reference intervals of the serum CysC/Cr ratio for neonates including very low birth weight infants. CASE-DIAGNOSIS/TREATMENT: A total of 883 blood samples were collected from 246 neonates during the first 30 days of life for the concurrent measurement of serum CysC and Cr levels. Infants with symptoms or signs of acute kidney injury, systemic illness, congenital anomaly, or renal pathology were excluded. The association between serum CysC/Cr ratio and the subgroups of patients was also analyzed. Reference intervals of serum CysC/Cr ratio were determined according to the postnatal age and post-conceptional age (PCA). CysC/Cr ratio level increased according to PCA, except in the first three postnatal days. The serum CysC/Cr ratio correlated positively with gestational age at birth, birth weight, postnatal age, and PCA, and negatively with serum CysC and Cr (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Reference levels of serum CysC/Cr ratio were determined according to postnatal age and PCA.

This study examined if there was greater hepatic, pancreatic, splenic, or renal injury in mice that would die during sepsis induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) compared with that of those that would survive. Mice were stratified into groups predicted to die (Die-P) or predicted to live (Live-P) in the first 5 days after CLP based on plasma interleukin 6 levels. Groups were sacrificed to harvest organs for histology. Separate animals were followed for survival with daily blood sampling to examine renal function. No significant histological evidence of organ injury was observed in either the Live-P or Die-P mice. Minimal hepatic injury occurred as plasma aspartate transaminase demonstrated less than a 2-fold increase over normal in both groups. In addition, pancreatic injury was minimal as there was also less than a 2-fold increase in plasma amylase levels. In contrast, blood urea nitrogen levels were nearly five times higher within 24 h in Die-P mice compared with those of mice predicted to live. Mice with blood urea nitrogen levels higher than 44 mg/dL had a 17.6 higher relative risk of dying (95% confidence interval, 4.5-69.4). Cystatin C, a more specific kidney function biomarker, was also elevated at 24 h after CLP. When the cystatin C levels were analyzed relative to the hours before death, rather than hours after CLP, they were also significantly increased in mice Dead by day 5 compared with those Alive after day 5. We conclude that limited liver, pancreas, and spleen injury develops during murine CLP-induced sepsis while significant kidney injury is present. The renal injury becomes worse closer to death. "

BACKGROUND: The ROCKET AF trial demonstrated similar risks of stroke/systemic embolism and major/nonmajor clinically relevant bleeding (principal safety endpoint) with rivaroxaban and warfarin. METHODS: The risk of the principal safety and component bleeding endpoints with rivaroxaban versus warfarin were compared, and factors associated with major bleeding were examined in a multivariable model. RESULTS: The principal safety endpoint was similar in the rivaroxaban and warfarin groups (14.9 vs. 14.5 events/100 patient-years; hazard ratio: 1.03; 95% confidence interval: 0.96 to 1.11). Major bleeding risk increased with age, but there were no differences between treatments in each age category (<65, 65 to 74, >=75 years; pinteraction = 0.59). Compared with those without (n = 13,455), patients with a major bleed (n = 781) were more likely to be older, current/prior smokers, have prior gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, mild anemia, and a lower calculated creatinine clearance and less likely to be female or have a prior stroke/transient ischemic attack. Increasing age, baseline diastolic blood pressure (DBP) >=90 mm Hg, history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or GI bleeding, prior acetylsalicylic acid use, and anemia were independently associated with major bleeding risk; female sex and DBP <90 mm Hg were associated with a decreased risk.

Both the elevation and reduction of this ratio have been linked with male infertility suggesting that abnormalities in protamine expression, processing and replacement may be responsible for effects on semen parameters observed in infertile males affected by deficient protamination, along with abnormalities in associated regulatory processes. Abnormal protamination may result in insufficient condensation in the sperm nucleus, thus rendering paternal DNA susceptible to damage, which could have detrimental consequences upon embryogenesis. Consequently, it is imperative that Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ARTs) endeavour to utilise sperm devoid of protamine abnormalities, especially because retained histones are present in imprinted gene clusters. Emerging evidence indicates that abnormalities in protamine content may influence epigenetic signals transmitted via paternal DNA. Indeed, an increase in rare imprinting disorders has been observed in children conceived via in vitro fertilisation (IVF).

However, the underlying mechanisms by which curcumin suppresses the metastasis of pancreatic cancer are still not fully elucidated. Our previous study demonstrated that a moderate amount of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is able to promote pancreatic cancer invasion. The aim of this study was to determine whether curcumin can suppress H2O2-induced tumor invasive and migratory abilities. Human pancreatic cancer BxPC-3 and Panc-1 cells were exposed to H2O2 with or without curcumin or N-acetylcysteine (NAC; a scavenger of free radicals). The effects of curcumin on pancreatic cancer cell proliferation was analyzed using MTT assay. The intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) was determined using 2,7-dichlorodihydrofluorecein diacetate. The cellular invasive and migratory abilities were analyzed using Transwell Matrigel invasion assay and wound healing assay, respectively. The expressions of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 were determined using qT-PCR and western blotting at mRNA and protein level. The activation of p-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and p-nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) were measured by western blotting. Our data showed that curcumin inhibited cancer cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Curcumin and NAC were able to inhibit H2O2-induced ROS production, reduce the migration and invasion, and decrease the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in pancreatic cancer cells. In addition, the H2O2-induced elevation of p-ERK and p-NF-kappaB in BxPC-3 and Panc-1 cells were reduced by curcumin, NAC and PD 98059 (an ERK inhibitor). These data indicate that curcumin suppresses pancreatic cancer migration and invasion through the inhibition of the ROS/ERK/NF-kappaB signaling pathway. This study suggests that curcumin may be a potential anticancer agent for pancreatic cancer. "

By combining chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with mass spectrometry, we investigated cis-regulatory regions in macrophages to comprehensively identify histone marks specifically associated with enhancers, and to profile their dynamics after transcriptional activation elicited by an inflammatory stimulation. The intersection of the proteomics data with ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analyses revealed the existence of novel subpopulations of enhancers, marked by specific histone modification signatures: specifically, H3K4me1/K36me2 marks transcribed enhancers, while H3K4me1/K36me3 and H3K4me1/K79me2 combinations mark distinct classes of intronic enhancers.

Patients with RPS19 mutations had the fewest number of defects, while patients with RPL5 had the greatest number of birth defects. This is the first study to show differences between DBA genetic groups with regards to treatment. Previously unreported differences in the rate and types of birth defects were also identified. These data allow better patient counseling, a more personalized monitoring plan, and may also suggest differential functions of DBA genes on ribosome and extra-ribosomal functions."

Immune modulating antibodies have recently emerged as a highly promising treatment modality in multiple cancer types. We present results from the first study to evaluate the immune modulating antibody MDV9300 (pidilizumab) in pediatric patients with DIPG. All patients aged 3 years and older, diagnosed with DIPG between February 2014 and June 2015 in Israel, were offered to participate in the study. Enrolled patients were started on biweekly 6 mg/kg MDV9300 after radiation completion. Treatment was continued until disease progression on imaging. Patients were followed biweekly for the occurrence of neurological deficit toxicities and side effects. Secondary endpoints were event free survival and overall survival. Of 13 children diagnosed with DIPG during the study period, nine were enrolled in the study. The patients underwent radiotherapy and none had chemotherapy. A total of 83 cycles of MDV9300 (range 2-16) were applied. The main side effects were neutropenia (CTCAE grade 1-3), mild to moderate fatigue, and acute elevation of blood pressure. Four patients died within 1 year of the diagnosis, another three died within 2 years and two children are still alive nearly 30 months from diagnosis, with stable disease. The median event free survival is 9.3 months (range 6.8-24) and the median overall survival is 15.6 months (range 6.9-28). Preliminary results demonstrate that MDV9300 treatment is safe and may be effective in the treatment of children with DIPG."

In breast cancer, adipocytes are not only found adjacent to cancer cells, but they also play an active role in the entire process of cancer development, progression, metastasis, and treatment response. Factors including the secretion of adipokines such as leptin and adiponectin, as well as autotaxin, interleukin 6, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and hepatic growth factor, metabolic remodeling that supports the growth of breast cancer by transfer of fatty acids to increase mitochondrial beta-oxidation, extracellular matrix remodeling and endotrophin production from type IV collagen, and cancer-associated fibroblast phenotype changes have all been implicated in this comprehensive process. Moreover, adipocytes may act as obstacles to therapy, as they are involved in mechanisms of resistance against various breast cancer treatments. Adipose tissues may also be a reservoir for dormant tumor cells during postsurgical autologous fat grafting. Thus, adipocytes, and the processes and pathways in which they are involved, could be effective therapeutic targets for breast cancer. In this review, we focus on the current understanding of adipocyte biology as it affects breast cancer."

However, many aggressive cancers, including breast cancer, were reported to escape the successful killing of NK cells in a tumor microenvironment. In this study, we investigated the anti-cancer effect of curcumin in coculture of human breast carcinoma MDA-MB-231 and NK (NK-92) cells. We found that curcumin had an immune-stimulatory effect on NK-92 by increasing the surface expression of the CD16+ and CD56dim population of NK-92. We confirmed that the cytotoxic effect of NK-92 on MDA-MB-231 was significantly enhanced in the presence of curcumin, which was highly associated with the activation of Stat4 and Stat5 proteins in NK-92. Finally, this improved anticancer effect of curcumin was correlated with decreased expression of pErk and PI3K in MDA-MB-231."

Exon skipping uses synthetic antisense oligonucleotides (AONs) to splice out frame-disrupting exon(s) of DMD mRNA to restore the reading frame of the gene products and produce truncated yet functional proteins. The FDA conditionally approved the first exon-skipping AON, called eteplirsen (brand name ExonDys51), targeting exon 51 of the DMD gene, in late 2016. Using a cocktail of AONs, multiple exons can be skipped, which can theoretically treat 80-90% of patients with DMD. Although the success of multiple exon skipping in a DMD dog model has made a significant impact on the development of therapeutics for DMD, unmodified AONs such as phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMOs) have little efficacy in cardiac muscles. Here, we describe our technique of intravenous injection of a cocktail of peptide-conjugated PMOs (PPMOs) to skip multiple exons, exons 6 and 8, in both skeletal and cardiac muscles in dystrophic dogs and the evaluation of the efficacy and toxicity."

PCOS model rats were established by dehydroepiandrosterone injection. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) measured serum sex hormones. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was used to examine histological changes of the ovarian tissues. The expression levels of FKBP52 were detected by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining, reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analysis and western blotting (WB). In addition, RT-qPCR analysis was used to detect the mRNA expression of AR, and WB was used to detect the protein expression levels of AR, ERK1/2 and phosphorylated (p-)ERK1/2. In granulosa cell (GC) experiments, primary GCs were extracted and cultured. FKBP4 is the FKBP52-encoding gene, therefore, adenovirus vectors Ad-Oe-FKBP4-EGFP and Ad-siRNA-FKBP4-EGFP were constructed to examine the association among the above factors using the RT-qPCR and WB methods. In the animal experiment, the vaginal smear, H&E staining and ELISA results showed that the PCOS model was successfully established. The IHC staining revealed that the expression of FKBP52 in the GCs of the PCOS model group was higher than the remaining groups (P<0.01). The mRNA and expression levels of FKBP52 and AR in the PCOS model rats were significantly increased, when compared with levels in the other rats (P<0.05). The expression level of p-ERK1/2 was also higher (P<0.05). In the GC experiment, following overexpression of the FKBP4 gene, the mRNA and expression levels of FKBP52 and AR were increased (P<0.05). The expression level of p-ERK1/2 was also increased (P<0.05). Following FKBP4 gene silencing, the mRNA and expression levels of FKBP52 and AR were decreased (P<0.05). The expression level of ERK1/2 was also decreased (P<0.05). However, the expression level of p-ERK1/2 was increased (P<0.05). In conclusion, the upregulation of co-chaperone FKBP52 may mediate the activation of AR through the MAPK/ERK pathway."

Interestingly, location is associated with the underlying disease as pulmonary mucormycosis is more frequent in hematological malignancy patients whereas rhino-orbito-cerebral mucormycosis is associated with diabetes. Cutaneous mucormycosis results from direct inoculation, mainly after trauma or surgery. Gastro-intestinal mucormycosis occurs after ingestion of contaminated food or with contaminated device and involves the stomach or colon.

This organization ensures coordinated gene expression by co-transcription. Often, however, alternative genetic responses to specific stress conditions demand the discoordination of operon expression. During cold temperature stress, accumulation of the gene encoding the sole Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (DEAD)-box RNA helicase in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, crhR (slr0083), increases 15-fold. Here, we show that crhR is expressed from a dicistronic operon with the methylthiotransferase rimO/miaB (slr0082) gene, followed by rapid processing of the operon transcript into two monocistronic mRNAs. This cleavage event is required for and results in destabilization of the rimO transcript. Results from secondary structure modeling and analysis of RNase E cleavage of the rimO-crhR transcript in vitro suggested that CrhR plays a role in enhancing the rate of the processing in an auto-regulatory manner. Moreover, two putative small RNAs are generated from additional processing, degradation, or both of the rimO transcript. These results suggest a role for the bacterial RNA helicase CrhR in RNase E-dependent mRNA processing in Synechocystis and expand the known range of organisms possessing small RNAs derived from processing of mRNA transcripts."

The KRAS p.G12C mutation occurs in 13% of non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) and in 1 to 3% of colorectal cancers and other cancers. Sotorasib is a small molecule that selectively and irreversibly targets KRASG12C. METHODS: We conducted a phase 1 trial of sotorasib in patients with advanced solid tumors harboring the KRAS p.G12C mutation. Patients received sotorasib orally once daily. The primary end point was safety. Key secondary end points were pharmacokinetics and objective response, as assessed according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1. RESULTS: A total of 129 patients (59 with NSCLC, 42 with colorectal cancer, and 28 with other tumors) were included in dose escalation and expansion cohorts. Patients had received a median of 3 (range, 0 to 11) previous lines of anticancer therapies for metastatic disease. No dose-limiting toxic effects or treatment-related deaths were observed. A total of 73 patients (56.6%) had treatment-related adverse events; 15 patients (11.6%) had grade 3 or 4 events. In the subgroup with NSCLC, 32.2% (19 patients) had a confirmed objective response (complete or partial response) and 88.1% (52 patients) had disease control (objective response or stable disease); the median progression-free survival was 6.3 months (range, 0.0+ to 14.9 [with + indicating that the value includes patient data that were censored at data cutoff]). In the subgroup with colorectal cancer, 7.1% (3 patients) had a confirmed response, and 73.8% (31 patients) had disease control; the median progression-free survival was 4.0 months (range, 0.0+ to 11.1+). Responses were also observed in patients with pancreatic, endometrial, and appendiceal cancers and melanoma. CONCLUSIONS: Sotorasib showed encouraging anticancer activity in patients with heavily pretreated advanced solid tumors harboring the KRAS p.G12C mutation. Grade 3 or 4 treatment-related toxic effects occurred in 11.6% of the patients. (Funded by Amgen and others; CodeBreaK100 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03600883.)."

Diabetes, use of corticosteroids, metabolic/diabetic acidosis and Covid-19 mediated immunosuppression are reported in more than 70% of cases in mucormycosis patients. Coexisting mucormycosis, Covid-19 along with diabetes mellitus increase the likelihood of mortality.

Patients who have undergone the Fontan procedure have decreased cardiac output, increased systemic vascular resistance, abnormal diastolic function, and decreased exercise capacity compared with normal people. METHODS AND RESULTS: To test the hypothesis that afterload reduction therapy alters hemodynamic variables and augments exercise capacity in patients after a Fontan procedure, we compared the results of graded exercise with maximal effort from 18 subjects (14.5+/-6.2 years of age, 4 to 19 years after Fontan procedure) in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial using enalapril (0.2 to 0.3 mg x kg[-1] x d[-1], maximum 15 mg). Each treatment was administered for 10 weeks. Diastolic filling patterns at rest were assessed by Doppler determination of the systemic atrioventricular valve flow velocity at the conclusion of each therapy. No difference was detected in resting heart rate, blood pressure, or cardiac index. Diastolic filling patterns were also similar. Exercise duration was not different (6.4+/-2.6 [enalapril] versus 6.7+/-2.6 minutes [placebo]). The mean percent increase in cardiac index from rest to maximum exercise was slightly but significantly decreased in subjects after 10 weeks of enalapril therapy (102+/-34% [enalapril] versus 125+/-34% [placebo]; P<.02). At maximal exercise, cardiac index (3.5+/-0.9 [enalapril] versus 3.8+/-0.9 L x min[-1] x m2 [placebo]), oxygen consumption (18.3+/-9 [enalapril] versus 20.5+/-7 mL x min[-1] x kg[-1] [placebo]), minute ventilation (57.5+/-17 [enalapril] versus 55.4+/-19 L/min [placebo]), and total work (247+/-181 [enalapril] versus 261+/-197 W [placebo]) were not different.

One case group involved children under the age of 15 years having a tumor of the central nervous system (CNS). PROCEDURE: For both studies, one conducted in the northwestern area of Germany, the other covering the whole of West Germany, incident cases were identified from the nationwide German Childhood Cancer Registry, and controls were randomly selected from complete population registration files. RESULTS: In total 466 pediatric CNS tumor cases and 2,458 controls were available for analyses. We observed only few positive associations, namely, between CNS tumors and low birth weight [<2,500 g; odds ratio (OR), 1.73; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.06-2.84], between ependymoma and maternal smoking during pregnancy (>10 cigarettes per day: OR, 4.71; 95% CI, 1.69-13.1), and between astrocytoma and exposure to wood preservatives (OR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.22-3.01).

A reduced incidence of postoperative AF has been described in CABG patients receiving IV tri-iodothyronine (T3). This study was designed to define the role of thyroid metabolism on the genesis of postoperative AF. METHODS AND RESULTS: Free T3 (fT3), free thyroxine (fT4), and thyroid stimulating hormone were assayed at admission in 107 consecutive patients undergoing isolated CABG surgery. Patients with thyroid disease or taking drugs known to interfere with thyroid function were excluded. A preoperative rhythm other than sinus rhythm was considered an exclusion criterion. Thirty-three patients (30.8%) had postoperative AF. An older age (P=0.03), no therapy with beta-blockers (P=0.08), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (P=0.08), lower left ventricle ejection fraction (P=0.09) and lower fT3 concentration (P=0.001), were univariate predictors of postoperative AF. On multivariate analysis, low fT3 concentration and lack of beta-blocking therapy were independently related with the development of postoperative AF (odds ratio, OR, 4.425; 95% confidence interval, CI, 1.745-11.235; P=0.001 and OR 3.107; 95% CI 1.087-8.875; P=0.03, respectively).

Almost all patients have headache, but the greatest morbidity of the disorder is visual loss related to optic disc swelling. Common radiographic findings in pseudotumor cerebri include an empty sella, dilation of the optic nerve sheaths and elevation of the optic disc. The CSF, aside from elevated opening pressure, is normal without evidence of infection or inflammation. Treatment of patients with no or mild to moderate visual loss is primarily medical, with acetazolamide as the first-line agent. Acetazolamide decreases CSF production.

The methods have been benchmarked using KEGG pathway data and RegulonDB Escherichia coli operon data. With optimum parameters, the specificity of the GNM is 93% and the sensitivity is 70%. For the GGM, the specificity is 95% and the sensitivity is 68%. Together, the two methods have a sensitivity of 87.2%, while joint predictions have a sensitivity of 50% and a specificity of 98%.

Among congenital fibrinogen deficiencies, quantitative defects (also called type I deficiencies; i.e. congenital afibrino-genemia [CAF] and hypofibrinogenemia) are characterized by the concomitant absence or reduction of coagulant activity and immunoreactive protein, while qualitative defects (type II deficiencies; i.e. dysfibrinogenemia and hypodysfibrino-genemia) show low clotting protein in contrast with normal or moderately reduced antigen. Patients affected by CAF (Mendelian Inheritance in Man, [MIM] #202400) or severe hypofibrinogenemia (MIM+134820, *134830, and *134850) may experience bleeding manifestations varying from mild to catastrophic. Although many cases of fibrinogen deficiencies have been described from a clinical point of view, only in a minority of cases the causal mutation was identified. The genetic defects so far described, most unique for any analyzed family, are invariantly located in the fibrinogen cluster; for only few of them the pathogenic role either at the protein or at the mRNA level has been investigated. This review, besides providing a concise description of the main structural and functional properties of fibrinogen and giving an overview of the clinical manifestations, the laboratory diagnosis and therapeutic approches, will be focused on the present knowledge on the genetic basis of quantitative fibrinogen deficiencies. Our systematic analysis of the available clinical and genetic data on these disorders evidences their high allelic heterogeneity, the existence of different pathogenic mechanisms, and the absence of strong genotype/phenotype correlations."

The features include (i) the identification of TMBs using the preference of residue pairs in globular, transmembrane helical (TMH) and TMBs, (ii) elimination of globular/TMH proteins that show sequence identity of more than 70% for the coverage of 80% residues with known structures, (iii) elimination of globular/TMH proteins that have sequence identity of more than 60% with known sequences in SWISS-PROT, and (iv) exclusion of TMH proteins using SOSUI, a prediction system for TMH proteins. Our approach picked up 7% TMBs in all the considered genomes. The comparison between the identified TMBs in E. coli genome and available experimental data demonstrated that the new approach could correctly identify all the 11 known TMBs, whose crystal structures are available. Further, it revealed the presence of 19 TMBs, homology with known structures, 60 TMBs similar to well annotated sequences, and 54 TMBs that have high sequence similarity with Escherichia coli beta-barrel proteins deposited in Transport Classification Database (TCDB). Interestingly, the present approach identified TMBs from all 15 families in TCDB. In human genome, the occurrence of TMBs varies from 0 to 3% in different chromosomes. We suggest that our approach could lead to a step forward in the advancement of structural and functional genomics."

Because of its complexity, biochemical analysis of the spliceosome has been previously limited to bulk assays in largely unfractionated cell extracts. We now report development of methodologies for studying the splicing of isolated single pre-mRNA molecules in real time. In this system, a fluorescently tagged pre-mRNA is tethered to a glass surface via its 3'-end. Splicing can be observed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae whole cell extract by monitoring loss of intron-specific fluorescence with a multi-wavelength total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscope. To prolong fluorophore lifetime, two enzyme-based O2 scavenging systems compatible with splicing were also developed. This work provides a powerful new approach for elucidating the mechanisms of spliceosome function and demonstrates the feasibility of utilizing TIRF microscopy for biochemical studies of single molecules in highly complex environments."

Frequent alteration in the expression of MITF is detected in melanoma, but the mechanism(s) underlying the alteration in expression have not been completely determined. In these studies, we have identified microRNA-137 (miR-137) as a regulator of MITF expression. The genomic locus of miR-137 at chromosome 1p22 places it in a region of the human genome previously determined to harbor an allele for melanoma susceptibility. Here, we show that expression of mature miR-137 in melanoma cell lines down-regulates MITF expression. Further, we have identified a 15-bp variable nucleotide tandem repeat located just 5' to the pre-miR-137 sequence, which alters the processing and function of miR-137 in melanoma cell lines."

The aim was to evaluate the correlation between endoscopic disease activity and fecal calprotectin, Clinical Activity Index, C-reactive protein (CRP), and blood leukocytes. METHODS: UC patients undergoing colonoscopy were prospectively enrolled and scored independently according the endoscopic and clinical part of the Rachmilewitz Index. Patients and controls provided fecal and blood samples for measuring calprotectin, CRP, and leukocytes. RESULTS: Values in UC patients (n = 134) compared to controls (n = 48): calprotectin: 396 +- 351 versus 18.1 +- 5 mug/g, CRP 16 +- 13 versus 3 +- 2 mg/L, blood leukocytes 9.9 +- 3.5 versus 5.4 +- 1.9 g/L (all P < 0.001). Endoscopic disease activity correlated closest with calprotectin (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient r = 0.834), followed by Clinical Activity Index (r = 0.672), CRP (r = 0.503), and leukocytes (r = 0.461). Calprotectin levels were significantly lower in UC patients with inactive disease (endoscopic score 0-3, calprotectin 42 +- 38 mug/g), compared to patients with mild (score 4-6, calprotectin 210 +- 121 mug/g, P < 0.001), moderate (score 7-9, calprotectin 392 +- 246 mug/g, P = 0.002), and severe disease (score 10-12, calprotectin 730 +- 291 mug/g, P < 0.001). The overall accuracy for the detection of endoscopically active disease (score >=4) was 89% for calprotectin, 73% for Clinical Activity Index, 62% for elevated CRP, and 60% for leukocytosis. CONCLUSIONS: Fecal calprotectin correlated closest with endoscopic disease activity, followed by Clinical Activity Index, CRP, and blood leukocytes. Furthermore, fecal calprotectin was the only marker that reliably discriminated inactive from mild, moderate, and highly active disease, which emphasizes its usefulness for activity monitoring."

The predominant epigenetic mechanisms are DNA methylation, modifications to chromatin, loss of imprinting and non-coding RNA. Epigenetic regulation of gene expression appears to have long-term effects and wide-ranging effects on health. Diet and environmental exposures may potentially alter the level and scope of epigenetic regulation, thus interesting developments in the study of epigenetics might explain correlations that researchers have found between lifestyle and risk of disease. Aberrant epigenetic patterns have been linked to a number of digestive diseases including Barrett's esophagus, cirrhosis, inflammatory bowel disease, and numerous gastrointestinal malignancies. In fact, many exciting discoveries about epigenetics in general have been made by studying diseases of the gastrointestinal tract and hepatobiliary tree. Epigenetic modifications of DNA in cancer and precancerous lesions offer hope and the promise of novel biomarkers for early cancer detection, prediction, prognosis, and response to treatment. Furthermore, reversal of epigenetic changes represents a potential target of novel therapeutic strategies and medication design. In the future, it is anticipated that innovative diagnostic tests, treatment regimens, and even lifestyle modifications will be based on epigenetic mechanisms and be incorporated into the practice of medicine."

In addition, iPSCs provide a unique opportunity to model human diseases with complex genetic traits, and a panel of human diseases have been successfully modeled in vitro by patient-specific iPSCs. Despite these progresses, recent studies have raised the concern for genetic and epigenetic abnormalities of iPSCs that could contribute to the immunogenicity of some cells differentiated from iPSCs. The oncogenic potential of iPSCs is further underscored by the findings that the critical tumor suppressor p53, known as the guardian of the genome, suppresses induced pluripotency.

Recent studies on high-grade pediatric GBM have identified two recurrent mutations (K27M and G34R/V) in genes encoding histone H3 (H3F3A for H3.3 and HIST1H3B for H3.1). The two histone H3 mutations are mutually exclusive and give rise to tumors in different brain compartments. Recently, we and others have shown that the histone H3 K27M mutation specifically altered the di- and tri-methylation of endogenous histone H3 at Lys27. Genome-wide studies using ChIP-seq on H3.3K27M patient samples indicate a global reduction of H3K27me3 on chromatin. Remarkably, we also found a dramatic enrichment of H3K27me3 and EZH2 (the catalytic subunit H3K27 methyltransferase) at hundreds of gene loci in H3.3K27M patient cells. Here, we discuss potential mechanisms whereby H3K27me3 is enriched at chromatin loci in cells expressing the H3.3K27M mutation and report effects of Lys-to-Met mutations of other well-studied lysine residues of histone H3.1/H3.3 and H4 on the corresponding endogenous lysine methylation. We suggest that mutation(s) on histones may be found in a variety of human diseases, and the expression of mutant histones may help to address the function of histone lysine methylation and possibly other modifications in mammalian cells."

BACKGROUND: Because symptoms of HFpEF are typically exertional, optimization of diastolic filling time by controlling heart rate may delay the onset of symptoms. METHODS: Sixty-one patients with HFpEF were randomly assigned to ivabradine 5 mg twice daily (n = 30) or placebo (n = 31) for 7 days in this double-blind trial. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing with echocardiographic assessment of myocardial function and left ventricular filling were undertaken at rest and after exercise. RESULTS: The ivabradine group demonstrated significant improvement between baseline and follow-up exercise capacity (4.2 +- 1.8 METs vs. 5.7 +- 1.9 METs, p = 0.001) and peak oxygen uptake (14.0 +- 6.1 ml/min/kg vs. 17.0 +- 3.3 ml/min/kg, p = 0.001), with simultaneous reduction in exercise-induced increase in the ratio of peak early diastolic mitral flow velocity to peak early diastolic mitral annular velocity (3.1 +- 2.7 vs. 1.3 +- 2.0, p = 0.004). Work load-corrected chronotropic response (the difference in heart rate at the same exercise time at the baseline and follow-up tests) showed a slower increase in heart rate during exercise than in the placebo-treated group. Therapy with ivabradine (beta = 0.34, p = 0.04) and change with treatment in exertional increase in the ratio of peak early diastolic mitral flow velocity to peak early diastolic mitral annular velocity (beta = -0.30, p = 0.02) were independent correlates of increase in exercise capacity, and therapy with ivabradine (beta = 0.32, p = 0.007) was independently correlated with increase in peak oxygen uptake. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with HFpEF, short-term treatment with ivabradine increased exercise capacity, with a contribution from improved left ventricular filling pressure response to exercise as reflected by the ratio of peak early diastolic mitral flow velocity to peak early diastolic mitral annular velocity. Because this patient population is symptomatic on exertion, therapeutic treatments targeting abnormal exercise hemodynamic status may prove useful.

However, for any given protein of interest, determining which of the identified polypeptides represent bona fide interactors versus those that are background contaminants (for example, proteins that interact with the solid-phase support, affinity reagent or epitope tag) is a challenging task. The standard approach is to identify nonspecific interactions using one or more negative-control purifications, but many small-scale AP-MS studies do not capture a complete, accurate background protein set when available controls are limited. Fortunately, negative controls are largely bait independent. Hence, aggregating negative controls from multiple AP-MS studies can increase coverage and improve the characterization of background associated with a given experimental protocol. Here we present the contaminant repository for affinity purification (the CRAPome) and describe its use for scoring protein-protein interactions.

Twenty-five years ago, abnormal calcium cycling was identified as a characteristic of failing human myocardium. Sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA2a), the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium pump, was found to be a key factor in the alteration of calcium cycling. With the advancement of gene vectors, SERCA2a emerged as an attractive clinical target for gene delivery purposes. Using adeno-associated virus constructs, SERCA2a upregulation has been found to improve myocardial function in animal models. The clinical benefits of overexpressing SERCA2a have been demonstrated in the phase I study Calcium Upregulation by Percutaneous Administration of Gene Therapy in Cardiac Disease (CUPID). This study has demonstrated that a persistent expression of the transgene SERCA2a is associated with a significant improvement in associated biochemical alterations and clinical symptoms of heart failure. In the coming years, additional targets will likely emerge that are amenable to genetic manipulations along with the development of more advanced vector systems with safer delivery approaches."

In neurosurgery, 5-aminolevulinic acid based photodynamic therapy (5-ALA PDT) is used for malignant glioma in vitro and in vivo. Data about PDT in meningioma, which is the second most frequent primary brain tumor, is sparse. Preliminary work indicated that meningiomas are more resistant to PDT than gliomas. In the present study we evaluated whether the effect of 5-ALA PDT on malignant meningioma cells can be increased by ciprofloxacin and changes in incubation time, factors known to influence the effectiveness of PDT in other tumor entities. METHODS: An in vitro-PDT model of a malignant human meningioma cell line (KT21-MG) was chosen as screening method. Cultured cells were incubated with varying 5-ALA concentrations for 4h and exposed to PDT (control group). Two experimental groups, one with 5-ALA and ciprofloxacin (group I) and one with 24-h ALA incubation time (group II), were studied, respectively. Cell viability was assessed by WST-1 assay. RESULTS: Ciprofloxacin and longer ALA incubation time significantly increased the lethal effect of 5-ALA PDT on meningioma cells. CONCLUSIONS: Efficacy of 5-ALA PDT could be increased by adjunction of ciprofloxacin in conventional clinical dosing and by prolongation of ALA incubation time. As ciprofloxacin is a common antibiotic with good tissue penetration, low toxicity and a favorable risk profile it represents a clinically interesting method for future PDT trials in meningiomas."

Sorted Treg cells of RA patients were analysed for expression of anti-apoptotic regulators Bcl-2 and microRNA-21 (miR-21) by RT-PCR. RESULTS: Treg cells displaying a memory phenotype were abundant in the SF of RA patients. SF Treg cells more frequently expressed the proliferation marker Ki-67 than conventional T cells. Only few SF Treg cells were apoptotic, as indicated by limited annexin V staining of these cells. SF Treg cells displayed high transcription levels of Bcl-2 and miR-21 in comparison with SF conventional T cells and peripheral blood Treg cells.

Both CD16 isoforms undergo a rapid down-regulation in expression by ADAM17-mediated proteolytic cleavage upon cell activation by various stimuli. We examined soluble CD16 released from activated NK cells and neutrophils by mass spectrometric analysis, and identified three separate cleavage sites in close proximity at P1/P1' positions alanine195/valine196, valine196/serine197, and threonine198/isoleucine199, revealing a membrane proximal cleavage region in CD16. Substitution of the serine at position 197 in the middle of the cleavage region for a proline (S197P) effectively blocked CD16a and CD16b cleavage in cell-based assays. We also show that CD16a/S197P was resistant to cleavage when expressed in the human NK cell line NK92 and primary NK cells derived from genetically-engineered human induced pluripotent stem cells. CD16a is a potent activating receptor and despite blocking CD16a shedding, the S197P mutation did not disrupt IgG binding by the receptor or its activation of NK92 cells by antibody-treated tumor cells.

Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors target DNA repair and are specifically active in cells that have impaired repair of DNA by the homologous recombination (HR) pathway. Cells with mutated BRCA function have HR deficiency (HRD), which is also present in a significant proportion of non-BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer. DESIGN: In the last decade, olaparib, the first and most-investigated oral PARP inhibitor, has undergone phase I-III trials as a single agent, in comparison with and in addition to chemotherapy, and as a maintenance therapy following chemotherapy. RESULTS: The greatest benefit to-date has been in the maintenance setting, prolonging the progression-free survival of high-grade serous ovarian cancer with a BRCA1/2 mutation. In this group of patients, olaparib has received approval as maintenance following chemotherapy from the EMA, and accelerated approval as a single agent in women who have had three or more lines of therapy. Olaparib can be given for a prolonged period with few significant side-effects in most patients. Similar trials with other PARP inhibitors (rucaparib, niraparib and veliparib) are in progress and include non-BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer. Second-generation studies are exploring the combination of PARP inhibitors with anti-angiogenic drugs. CONCLUSIONS: PARP inhibitors represent a step change in the management of ovarian cancer. BRCA mutations are the first genotypic predictive markers in ovarian cancer and can be used to select patients who will most likely benefit from PARP inhibitors. BRCA testing is now becoming a routine part of the evaluation of women with ovarian cancer, and tests for HRD are being used to evaluate PARP inhibitors in an extended population of non-BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer."

        "text": "Epstein-Barr Virus Oncoprotein LMP1 Mediates Epigenetic Changes in Host Gene Expression through PARP1.\nUNLABELLED: The latent infection of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is associated with 1% of human cancer incidence. Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (PARylation) is a posttranslational modification catalyzed by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) that mediate EBV replication during latency. In this study, we detail the mechanisms that drive cellular PARylation during latent EBV infection and the effects of PARylation on host gene expression and cellular function. EBV-infected B cells had higher PAR levels than EBV-negative B cells. Moreover, cellular PAR levels were up to 2-fold greater in type III than type I latently infected EBV B cells. We identified a positive association between expression of the EBV genome-encoded latency membrane protein 1 (LMP1) and PAR levels that was dependent upon PARP1. PARP1 regulates gene expression by numerous mechanisms, including modifying chromatin structure and altering the function of chromatin-modifying enzymes. Since LMP1 is essential in establishing EBV latency and promoting tumorigenesis, we explored the model that disruption in cellular PARylation, driven by LMP1 expression, subsequently promotes epigenetic alterations to elicit changes in host gene expression. PARP1 inhibition resulted in the accumulation of the repressive histone mark H3K27me3 at a subset of LMP1-regulated genes. Inhibition of PARP1, or abrogation of PARP1 expression, also suppressed the expression of LMP1-activated genes and LMP1-mediated cellular transformation, demonstrating an essential role for PARP1 activity in LMP1-induced gene expression and cellular transformation associated with LMP1. In summary, we identified a novel mechanism by which LMP1 drives expression of host tumor-promoting genes by blocking generation of the inhibitory histone modification H3K27me3 through PARP1 activation. IMPORTANCE: EBV is causally linked to several malignancies and is responsible for 1% of cancer incidence worldwide. The EBV-encoded protein LMP1 is essential for promoting viral tumorigenesis by aberrant activation of several well-known intracellular signaling pathways. We have identified and defined an additional novel molecular mechanism by which LMP1 regulates the expression of tumor-promoting host genes. We found that LMP1 activates the cellular protein PARP1, leading to a decrease in a repressive histone modification, accompanied by induction in expression of multiple cancer-related genes. PARP1 inhibition or depletion led to a decrease in LMP1-induced cellular transformation. Therefore, targeting PARP1 activity may be an effective treatment for EBV-associated malignancies."

The biological diagnosis is based on a standard haemostasis assessment. All the coagulation tests that depend on the formation of fibrin as the end point are affected; although in dysfibrinogenemia the specificity and sensitivity of routine test depend on reagent and techniques. A genetic exploration permits to confirm the diagnosis and may enhance the prediction of the patient's phenotype. Homozygous or composite heterozygous null mutations are most often responsible for afibrinogenemia while hypofibrinogenemic patients are mainly heterozygous carrier of an afibrinogenemic allele. Heterozygous missense mutations are prevalent in dysfibrinogenemia, with two hot spot localized in exon 2 of the FGA and in the exon 8 of the FGG. The correlation between phenotype and genotype has been identified in some fibrinogen variants, including six mutations clustered in exons 8 and 9 of the FGG leading to hypofibrinogenemia with hepatic inclusions of abnormal fibrinogen aggregates as well as a few mutations associated with an increase risk of thrombotic events. A familial screening and additional functional assays should be carried out when possible. "

Although benign, its clinical behavior can often exhibit malignant characteristics. It is marked by slow and persistent growth with infiltration of adjacent tissues. Almost 70% occur in the mandible in patients older than 30 years. Recurrence of ameloblastoma from inadequate treatment is frequent. Because of its slow growth, recurrences can present decades after primary surgery. A primary ameloblastoma in an area outside the mandibular, maxillary, and infratemporal fossa regions has not been described in detail to date, with only 1 possible case mentioned in the literature. The authors present a case of primary temporal bone ameloblastoma in a 17-year-old boy. The tumor originated in the left mastoid, infiltrated the lateral semicircular canal, facial nerve, and cochlea, and adhered to the sigmoid sinus and posterior cranial fossa dura. Although invasion of multiple structures in the infratemporal fossa and temporal bone leads to variable disease presentation, this case is unique because the first symptom of disease was sudden and recurring unilateral sensorineural hearing loss. Surgery required transection of the facial nerve. Histopathology confirmed primary temporal bone ameloblastoma.

Moreover, recent findings are suggestive of the possibility that dysregulation of the enteric microbiota (i.e., dysbiosis) and associated bacterial translocation across the intestinal epithelium may be involved in the pathophysiology of stress-related psychiatric disorders, particularly depression. The current article reviews preliminary evidence linking the enteric microbiota and its metabolites to psychiatric illness, along with separate lines of empirical inquiry on the potential involvement of psychosocial stressors, proinflammatory cytokines and neuroinflammation, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and vagal nerve activation, respectively, in this relationship.

Many cellular processes and diseases are associated with this unique pleiotropic factor that include, but are not limited to, embryogenesis, tumorigenesis, inflammation, wound repair, neurodegeneration and lysosome function. Haploinsufficiency caused by autosomal dominant mutations within the GRN gene leads to frontotemporal lobar degeneration, a progressive neuronal atrophy that presents in patients as frontotemporal dementia. Frontotemporal dementia is an early onset form of dementia, distinct from Alzheimer's disease. The GRN-related form of frontotemporal lobar dementia is a proteinopathy characterized by the appearance of neuronal inclusions containing ubiquitinated and fragmented TDP-43 (encoded by TARDBP). The neurotrophic and neuro-immunomodulatory properties of progranulin have recently been reported but are still not well understood. Gene delivery of GRN in experimental models of Alzheimer's- and Parkinson's-like diseases inhibits phenotype progression.

The lack of available diagnostics to discriminate viral and bacterial etiologies contributes to this discordance. Recent efforts have focused on the host response as a source for novel diagnostic targets although none have explored the ability of host-derived microRNAs (miRNA) to discriminate between these etiologies. Methods: In this study, we compared host-derived miRNAs and mRNAs from human H3N2 influenza challenge subjects to those from patients with Streptococcus pneumoniae pneumonia. Sparse logistic regression models were used to generate miRNA signatures diagnostic of ARI etiologies. Generalized linear modeling of mRNAs to identify differentially expressed (DE) genes allowed analysis of potential miRNA:mRNA relationships. High likelihood miRNA:mRNA interactions were examined using binding target prediction and negative correlation to further explore potential changes in pathway regulation in response to infection. Results: The resultant miRNA signatures were highly accurate in discriminating ARI etiologies. Mean accuracy was 100% [88.8-100; 95% Confidence Interval (CI)] in discriminating the healthy state from S. pneumoniae pneumonia and 91.3% (72.0-98.9; 95% CI) in discriminating S. pneumoniae pneumonia from influenza infection. Subsequent differential mRNA gene expression analysis revealed alterations in regulatory networks consistent with known biology including immune cell activation and host response to viral infection. Negative correlation network analysis of miRNA:mRNA interactions revealed connections to pathways with known immunobiology such as interferon regulation and MAP kinase signaling. Conclusion: We have developed novel human host-response miRNA signatures for bacterial and viral ARI etiologies. miRNA host response signatures reveal accurate discrimination between S. pneumoniae pneumonia and influenza etiologies for ARI and integrated analyses of the host-pathogen interface are consistent with expected biology. These results highlight the differential miRNA host response to bacterial and viral etiologies of ARI, offering new opportunities to distinguish these entities."

HBV X protein (HBx), as the most frequently integrated viral gene sequence following HBV infection, plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of HCC. H3K27ac is a characteristic marker for identifying active enhancers and even indicates chromatin accessibility associated with super-enhancers (SEs). In this study, H3K27ac ChIP-seq was applied for high-quality SE annotation of HBx-induced SEs and chromatin accessibility evaluation. The results indicated that HBx preferentially affects enrichment of H3K27ac in transcription factor signaling pathway genes, including ETV4. RNA-seq indicated that ETV4 is upregulated by HBx and that upregulated ETV4 promotes HCC progression. Interestingly, ETV4 was also included in the 568 cancer driver gene pool obtained by the Integrative OncoGenomics pipeline. However, the biological function and mechanism of ETV4 remain incompletely understood. In vivo and in vitro, we found that increased ETV4 expression promotes HCC cell migration and invasion by upregulating DVL2 and activating Wnt/beta-catenin. The mRNA and protein levels of ETV4 are higher in tumor tissues compared with adjacent tissues, and high expression of ETV4 is associated with poor prognosis in HCC patients. In summary, we first confirm that ETV4 is significantly upregulated by HBx and involved in SE-associated chromatin accessibility. Increased expression of ETV4 promotes HCC cell invasion and metastasis by upregulating DVL2. The present study provides insight into the ETV4-DVL2-beta-catenin axis in HBV-related HCC, which will be helpful for treating patients with aggressive HCC."

In the CITYSCAPE trial, we aimed to assess the preliminary efficacy and safety of tiragolumab plus atezolizumab (anti-PD-L1) therapy as first-line treatment for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: CITYSCAPE is a phase 2, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Patients with chemotherapy-naive, PD-L1-positive (defined as a tumour proportion score of >=1% by 22C3 immunohistochemistry pharmDx assay; Dako, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) recurrent or metastatic NSCLC with measurable disease, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, and no EGFR or ALK alterations were enrolled from 41 clinics in Europe, Asia, and the USA. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1), via an interactive voice or web-based response system, to receive tiragolumab (600 mg) plus atezolizumab (1200 mg) or placebo plus atezolizumab intravenously once every 3 weeks. Investigators and patients were masked to treatment assignment. The co-primary endpoints were investigator-assessed objective response rate and progression-free survival as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 in the intention-to-treat population, analysed after approximately 80 progression-free survival events had been observed in the primary population. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03563716, and is ongoing. FINDINGS: Patients were enrolled between Aug 10, 2018, and March 20, 2019. At data cutoff for the primary analysis (June 30, 2019), 135 of 275 patients assessed for eligibility were randomly assigned to receive tiragolumab plus atezolizumab (67 [50%]) or placebo plus atezolizumab (68 [50%]). In this primary analysis, after a median follow-up of 5 9 months (4 6-7 6, in the intention-to-treat population, 21 patients (31 3% [95% CI 19 5-43 2]) in the tiragolumab plus atezolizumab group versus 11 patients (16 2% [6 7-25 7]) in the placebo plus atezolizumab group had an objective response (p=0 031). Median progression-free survival was 5 4 months (95% CI 4 2-not estimable) in the tiragolumab plus atezolizumab group versus 3 6 months (2 7-4 4) in the placebo plus atezolizumab group (stratified hazard ratio 0 57 [95% CI 0 37-0 90], p=0 015). 14 (21%) patients receiving tiragolumab plus atezolizumab and 12 (18%) patients receiving placebo plus atezolizumab had serious treatment-related adverse events. The most frequently reported grade 3 or worse treatment-related adverse event was lipase increase (in six [9%] patients in the tiragolumab plus atezolizumab group vs two [3%] in the placebo plus atezolizumab group). Two treatment-related deaths (of pyrexia and infection) occurred in the tiragolumab plus atezolizumab group. INTERPRETATION: Tiragolumab plus atezolizumab showed a clinically meaningful improvement in objective response rate and progression-free survival compared with placebo plus atezolizumab in patients with chemotherapy-naive, PD-L1-positive, recurrent or metastatic NSCLC. Tiragolumab plus atezolizumab was well tolerated, with a safety profile generally similar to that of atezolizumab alone. These findings demonstrate that tiragolumab plus atezolizumab is a promising immunotherapy combination for the treatment of previously untreated, locally advanced unresectable or metastatic NSCLC.

This results in a chronic inability to regulate blood glucose levels. The natural history of T1D is well-characterized in childhood. Evidence of two or more autoantibodies to the islet antigens insulin, GAD, IA-2 or ZnT8 in early childhood is associated with high risk of developing T1D in the future. Prediction of risk is less clear in adults and, overall, the factors controlling the progression rate from multiple islet autoantibody positivity to onset of symptoms are not fully understood. An anti-CD3 antibody, teplizumab, was recently shown to delay clinical progression to T1D in high-risk individuals including adults and older children. This represents an important proof of concept for those at risk of future T1D. Given their role in risk assessment, islet autoantibodies might appear to be the most obvious biomarkers to monitor efficacy. However, monitoring islet autoantibodies in clinical trials has shown only limited effects, although antibodies to the most recently identified autoantigen, tetraspanin-7, have not yet been studied in this context. Measurements of beta cell function remain fundamental to assessing efficacy and different models have been proposed, but improved biomarkers are required for both progression studies before onset of diabetes and in therapeutic monitoring.

It ranks as the third most prevalent angioinvasive fungal infection, following aspergillosis and candidiasis. This severe infection typically affects individuals with compromised immune systems, including those with hematological malignancies like leukemia and lymphoma, individuals who have undergone stem cell transplants, and people with diabetes mellitus. Individuals in good health are rarely affected, making immunocompromised individuals particularly vulnerable to this potentially fatal fungal disease. The aim of this study was to perform a comparative analysis of survivors versus non-survivors among diabetes patients admitted with mucormycosis. Methodology This was a descriptive observational study. A total of 338 patients were enrolled in the study. The study variables included demographics, COVID-19 infection, diabetes mellitus history, steroid use, use of oxygen support, and steam inhalation. Results Of the total 338 patients enrolled in the study, 253 (74.9%) were male and 85 (25.01%) were female. The number of survivors were 305 (90.2%) and non-survivors were 33(9.8%). The mean age of survivors was 52.50 +- 11.31 and non-survivors was 54.06 +- 8.54 years. Patients who underwent steam inhalation had a higher chance of survival compared to those who did not undergo steam inhalation and this association was statistically significant (p=0.01). Males showed a higher chance of survival (93.7%) as compared to females (80.0%). The associations between oxygen support, steroid use, and COVID-19 infection with the survival status were statistically non-significant. Conclusion There was a strong association between the history of steam inhalation and the outcome of mucormycosis among diabetes patients admitted with mucormycosis. Female patients demonstrated a higher fatality rate than males indicating a significant gender disparity observed in cases. Our findings may help to better identify and treat patients who are at higher risk for severe forms of mucormycosis."

To compare more directly the role of the Yaa and lpr genes in the development of the autoimmune syndrome, the Y chromosome of BXSB mice was transferred to MRL mice by backcross procedures, and the effect of the Yaa gene on the autoantibody formation and the development of lupus-like nephritis in MRL mice was investigated in comparison with those bearing the lpr mutation. The Yaa gene as well as the lpr gene were able to shorten the life span of MRL mice as a result of the accelerated development of lethal lupus-like nephritis. However, the acceleration promoted by the Yaa gene (50% mortality rate: 12 months) was less severe than that induced by the lpr gene (50% mortality rate: 7 months). This may be related to the finding that the lpr gene enhanced the production of a large spectrum of autoantibodies, including anti-DNA, rheumatoid factors and anti-gp70, and of cryoglobulins, whereas only anti-gp70 production among the autoantibodies studies was markedly enhanced by the Yaa gene. The selective autoimmune accelerating effect of the Yaa gene was similarly observed in (NZW X MRL)F1 hybrid mice. Our results suggest that the Yaa gene, unlike the lpr gene, exhibits selective autoimmune accelerating activity, but as a result of increased formation of certain nephritogenic autoantibodies such as anti-gp70 antibodies, the Yaa gene is able to accelerate the progression of lupus-like nephritis in lupus-prone mice."

As a result, morbidity and mortality from cardiomyopathy are likely to increase for patients with generalized myopathies. One hundred consecutive patients with dystrophin-deficient muscular dystrophy and a mean age of 17.2 yr (range, 5-41) satisfied criteria for having dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and received digitalis and diuretics. Nine of the 14 patients were symptom-free, despite left ventricular ejection fractions (LVEFs) of 25-40%. The five patients with symptomatic heart failure had severe ventricular dilatation, with LVEFs < 25%. Two of the five patients died of heart failure within 1 yr. For the remaining three patients, we evaluated the addition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril and, subsequently, the use of beta-blockers to the therapeutic regimen. Addition of these medications, never before attempted in the management of cardiomyopathy associated with generalized myopathic disease, complemented each other in relieving symptoms and reversing signs of congestive heart failure and DCM. We conclude that the combination of ACE inhibitor and beta-blocker deserves further exploration for inclusion in any management regimen for the treatment of muscular dystrophy-associated cardiomyopathy."

STUDY DESIGN: Two fresh human meningiomas were obtained from surgery and the frozen sections examined for type VI collagen and laminin with specific antibodies. RESULTS: Type VI collagen was found on the surface of the psammoma bodies. In addition, it was detected in the interstitial tissues surrounding the tumor cells and on the tumor cells themselves. Laminin was detected mainly in the walls of capillaries and large blood vessels. In contrast, in some psammoma bodies, laminin was detectable internally. Laminin was not found in the interstitial tissues or tumor cells. CONCLUSION: This is the first report to describe the involvement of type VI collagen in psammoma bodies and whorl formations in meningiomas. This specific type of collagen may serve an anchoring function in psammoma body development."

Defining the mechanisms underlying implantation at molecular level is challenging task in reproductive biology. In order to identify molecules involved in cellular interactions between trophoblastic and endometrial epithelial cells, we have established two human cell lines, trophoblastic HT-H and endometrial epithelial SNGM. These two cell types exhibit cell adhesion at their respective apical cell membranes. Molecules involved in this unique cell adhesion were identified by expression complementary DNA cloning and were named trophinin, tastin, and bystin. Trophinin is a membrane protein thought to have self-binding activity and thus mediates homophilic cell adhesion. Tastin and bystin are cytoplasmic proteins required for trophinin to exhibit cell adhesion activity. Trophinin is strongly expressed in trophectoderm of monkey blastocysts. In human endometrium, trophinin is expressed for a limited period in the luminal epithelium at the time expected for implantation. In human placenta, trophinin, tastin, and bystin are strongly expressed in trophoblast and endometrium at the uteroplacental interface at an early stage in pregnancy. All these molecules disappear from the human placenta in the second trimester. The unique expression pattern and cell adhesion activity exhibited by trophinin, tastin, and bystin suggest strongly the involvement of these molecules in the initial attachment of blastocyst to uterus."

Earlier we have shown that the novel MAR-associated protein SMAR1 interacts with p53. Here we delineate the minimal domain of SMAR1 (the arginine-serine-rich domain) that is phosphorylated by protein kinase C family proteins and is responsible for p53 interaction, activation, and stabilization within the nucleus. SMAR1-mediated stabilization of p53 is brought about by inhibiting Mdm2-mediated degradation of p53. We also demonstrate that this arginine-serine (RS)-rich domain triggers the various cell cycle modulating proteins that decide cell fate. Furthermore, phenotypic knock-down experiments using small interfering RNA showed that SMAR1 is required for activation and nuclear retention of p53. The level of phosphorylated p53 was significantly increased in the thymus of SMAR1 transgenic mice, showing in vivo significance of SMAR1 expression. This is the first report that demonstrates the mechanism of action of the MAR-binding protein SMAR1 in modulating the activity of p53, often referred to as the \"guardian of the genome.\""

DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: University hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Forty-six consecutive nonemergency patients 65 years or older undergoing cardiac surgery during 1999 to 2000 in Tampere University Hospital, Tampere, Finland. INTERVENTIONS: Free serum T3 concentration was used as a measure of serum triiodothyronine levels. Samples were taken preoperatively, on the fourth postoperative day, and at the 3-month follow-up. The hemodynamic state of the patients was estimated by whole-body impedance cardiography preoperatively, during the intensive care unit period, daily until the fourth postoperative day, and at the 3-month follow-up. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: AF occurred in 43% of the patients. The patients in the AF group had significantly more grafts (3.9 v 3.1, p = 0.02), and there was a small difference in age between the AF and non-AF groups (73 years v 69 years, p = 0.06). The free T3 concentration on the fourth postoperative day was significantly lower in the AF group (3.5 nmol/L v 4.6 nmol/L, p = 0.04). In logistic regression analysis, the independent predictors of AF were age, number of grafts, and serum free T3 concentration on the fourth postoperative day. In the group with low T3 concentration, the cardiac index was lower (1.4 v 1.8, p = 0.05) and the systemic vascular resistance index was higher (4,064 v 2,969, p = 0.04) but only immediately after the operation. Although the AF mostly appeared during the second to fourth postoperative days, there were no longer any differences in the hemodynamic state at that time. CONCLUSIONS: In a group of elderly patients undergoing cardiac surgery, there was a strong association between a postoperative decrease of serum triiodothyronine levels and atrial fibrillation. The decrease of serum triiodothyronine levels was related to the changes of hemodynamic parameters only in the immediate postoperative period."

It was withdrawn from the market worldwide in September 2004 because of an increased risk of cardiovascular events. Celecoxib, which belongs to the same class of drugs, is now under scrutiny for the risk of similar events. The objective of our study was to compare the incidence of gastrointestinal (GI) [symptomatic and complicated upper GI] events and thromboembolic (cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and peripheral venous) events reported for patients prescribed rofecoxib or celecoxib in primary care. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of selected events was conducted using data collected from previously conducted prescription-event monitoring (PEM) studies for rofecoxib and celecoxib. PEM is an observational cohort technique. Exposure data were derived from dispensed prescriptions for rofecoxib (July-November 1999) and celecoxib (May-December 2000) that were written by primary care general practitioners in England. Outcome data were clinical events and information on potential risk factors reported on simple questionnaires (posted to prescribers approximately 9 months after the date of the first prescription). Incidence rates of the first event during treatment within each thromboembolic and GI group were calculated during the 270 days after the patient started receiving either of the drugs; crude and adjusted rate ratios (RR) were calculated for rofecoxib compared with celecoxib using Poisson regression modelling. RESULTS: The rofecoxib and celecoxib PEM cohorts contained 15 268 and 17 458 patients, respectively. For the GI event groups, the adjusted RRs for rofecoxib compared with celecoxib were: 1.21 (95% CI 1.09, 1.36) for symptomatic upper GI events and 1.60 (95% CI 0.95, 2.70) for complicated upper GI conditions. For the thromboembolic event groups, the adjusted RRs were: 1.04 (95% CI 0.50, 2.17) for cardiovascular thromboembolic events; 1.43 (95% CI 0.86, 2.38) for cerebrovascular thromboembolic events; and 0.36 (95% CI 0.01, 1.34) for peripheral venous thromboembolic events. CONCLUSIONS: This study was a retrospective comparison of PEM studies conducted for rofecoxib and celecoxib. For symptomatic upper GI events, a 21% increase in the relative rate was found for rofecoxib users compared with celecoxib users after adjusting for identified risk factors. For complicated upper GI events, no statistically significant difference in the incidence was observed between rofecoxib and celecoxib users after adjusting for identified risk factors. For the three thromboembolic event groups, no evidence of a statistically significant difference between rofecoxib and celecoxib users was found after adjusting for identified risk factors. This study contributes to the understanding of the association between COX-2 inhibitors and thromboembolic events. However, it should be borne in mind that we had information on only a limited number of confounding variables for thromboembolic events. Further research is required to fully understand the risks and benefits of using celecoxib and other COX-2 inhibitors. Meanwhile, doctors should be cautious when prescribing these products, particularly to patients with risk factors for developing thromboembolic events."

Subsequently, ABC skin patch testing was introduced as a research tool to supplement clinical case ascertainment. In a randomized, prospective study evaluating the clinical utility of HLA-B*5701 screening, avoidance of ABC in HLA-B*5701-positive patients significantly reduced clinically diagnosed ABC HSR and eliminated patch test-positive ABC HSR. Finally, a retrospective PGx study supports the generalizability of the association across races. Prospective HLA-B*5701 screening should greatly reduce the incidence of ABC HSR by identifying patients at high risk for ABC HSR before they are treated."

In addition, they may compromise reproductive function, possibly contributing to subfertility, early pregnancy loss and later pregnancy complications such as pain, preterm labour, malpresentations, increased need for caesarean section, and postpartum haemorrhage. Large fibroids may distend the abdomen, which may be aesthetically displeasing to many women. Abnormal bleeding occurs in 30% of symptomatic women, and abnormal bleeding, bloating and pelvic discomfort due to mass effect constitute the most common symptoms. The incidence of fibroids is highest in Black women, who tend to have multiple and larger fibroids, and more symptomatic fibroids at the time of diagnosis. The prevalence of clinically significant myomas peaks in the perimenopausal years and declines after the menopause. It is not known why some fibroids are symptomatic while others are quiescent. The size, number and location of fibroids undoubtedly determine their clinical behaviour, but research has yet to correlate these parameters with clinical presentation of the fibroids."

Differences in opinion have arisen over the importance assigned to specific phosphorylation sites on RyR2, over the kinase (s) suggested to directly phosphorylate RyR2 and surrounding the possibility that altered phosphorylation of RyR2 is associated with contractile dysfunction observed in heart failure. Ca2+/calmodulin dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) can phosphorylate RyR2 and modulate its activity. This phosphorylation positively modulates cardiac inotropic function but in extreme situations such as heart failure, elevated CaMKII activity can adversely increase Ca2+ release from the SR and lead to arrhythmogenesis. Although other kinases can phosphorylate RyR2, most notably cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), evidence for a key role of CaMKII in mediating RyR2-dependent Ca2+ release is emerging. Future challenges include (i) fully identifying mechanisms of CaMKII interaction with the RyR2 complex and (ii) given the ubiquitous expression of CaMKII, developing selective strategies to modulate RyR2-targeted CaMKII activity and allow improved understanding of its role in normal and diseased heart."

The mutant frequencies (MFs) were determined 4 weeks after the irradiation. All doses of UVB irradiation enhanced gpt MFs by about 10 times than that of unirradiated mice. There were no significant differences in gpt MFs and the mutation spectra between p53(+/+) and p53(-/-) mice. The predominant mutations induced by UVB irradiation were G:C to A:T transitions at dipyrimidines. In contrast, in unirradiated p53(-/-) mice, the frequencies of Spi(-) large deletions of more than 1 kb and complex-type deletions with rearrangements were significantly higher than those of the Spi(-) large deletions in p53(+/+) counterparts. The specific Spi(-) mutation frequency of more than 1 kb deletions and complex types increased in a dose-dependent manner in the p53(+/+) mice. However, no increase of such large deletions was observed in irradiated p53(-/-) mice. These results suggest that the antigenotoxic effects of p53 may be specific to deletions and complex-type mutations induced by double-strand breaks in DNA."

My topics are etiology, herniosis, diverticulosis coli, and cancer. Hippocrates blamed wear and tear for herniation. Russell's (Lancet 1:1519-1523, 1902) explanation was congenital peritoneal \"buds\" extending down to the pelvis. Harrison (Arch Surg 4:680-689, 1922) attributed herniae to transversalis fascial degradation. Keith (Lancet 2(17):1398-1399, 1906) concluded that pathology was involved, even though Russell (Lancet 1:1519-1523, 1902) had denied it. Nevertheless, the congenital theory prevailed. According to McVay (Christopher's textbook of surgery, W.B. Saunders, Philadelphia, 1960, p. 159), defects arise in normal musculo-aponeurotic structures. Research showed that atrophy was caused by damaged fibroblasts producing less collagen, which was abnormal (having a reduced I/III ratio). The disease was systemic, later named herniosis. Nicotine addiction increased the incidence of herniation by an inflammatory process named metastatic emphysema. In 1948, Saint's Triad, an aggregation of hiatus hernia (later, any primary hernia), gallstones, and diverticulosis coli, was introduced. This association occurred eight times more often than expected, with herniosis appearing to be its cause, abetted by high blood cholesterol causing gallstones. In 2006, Krones et al. (Int J Colorectal Dis 21:18-24, 2006) provided evidence that colon cancer is accompanied by a reduction in diverticula. Klinge et al. (Hernia 8(4):300-301, 2004) showed that these entities require different extracellular matrices (ECMs). Ghajar and Bissell (Histochem Cell Biol 130:1105-1118, 2008) pointed out that the ECM, which comprises 80% of the breast, influences its epithelial genetic expression, likewise with other organs (kidney, skin, lung, colon, and ovaries). Recently, a fundamental change in our understanding of cancer growth and metastasis has taken place. Whereas the degradation of connective tissue was thought to encourage invasion, eliciting concern for the herniated, now, investigators report the reverse, a reactive vascularized stroma resembling wound healing with an increase in fibroblasts and collagen I. Words such as desmoplasia, fibrosis, and stiffening abound. In conclusion, degradation of the ECM may be why herniosis appears to be hostile to the development of cancer throughout the body. Studies are needed of patients with and without a history of hernia to determine their incidence of cancer. Data from smokers should be separated, since they carry their own high risk of malignancy."

Knowledge of genetic variants that predispose donors to iron deficiency would allow bleeding frequency and iron supplementation to be tailored to the individual donor. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The genotypes of five specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in three genes that have been previously associated with iron status and/or restless leg syndrome (RLS) were investigated in two groups of female blood donors. The first group had low iron stores (serum ferritin <= 12 microg/L, n = 657), and the second group had normal to high iron stores (serum ferritin > 30 microg/L, n = 645). Genotype distribution for each of the SNPs was compared between the two groups. RESULTS: Homozygosity for the T-allele of BTBD9 rs9296249 was associated with lower serum ferritin.

Here we investigated 1) whether the protection conferred by sevoflurane preconditioning sustains in time; 2) whether sevoflurane preconditioning diminishes mitochondrial dysfunction following cerebral ischemia; and 3) whether mitochondrial permeability transition pore plays a crucial role in the sevoflurane preconditioning. DESIGN: Laboratory investigation. SETTING: University research laboratory. SUBJECTS: : Sprague-Dawley rats. INTERVENTIONS: Rats underwent 2 hrs of focal cerebral ischemia induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion. Preconditioning was elicited with sevoflurane (2.3%) for 60 mins at 24 hrs before ischemia. The involvement of mitochondrial permeability transition pore was determined with a mitochondrial permeability transition pore opener atractyloside and a specific mitochondrial permeability transition pore inhibitor cyclosporin A. In vitro study was performed on acutely isolated mitochondria subjected to calcium overload. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Sevoflurane preconditioning significantly decreased the infarct size by 35.9% (95% confidence interval 6.5-28.4, p < .001). This reduction of injury volume was associated with a long-term improvement of neurological function according to modified neurological severity score (F = 13.6, p = .001) and sticky-tape test (F = 29.1, p < .001) for 42 days after ischemia. Furthermore, sevoflurane preconditioning markedly protected mitochondria, as indicated by preserved respiratory chain complex activities and membrane potential, lowered mitochondrial hydrogen-peroxide production, and attenuated mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening. Isolated mitochondria also demonstrated a reduced sensitivity to Ca-induced mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening after pre-exposure to sevoflurane in vitro (95% confidence interval 24.2-196.5,p = .006). Inhibiting mitochondrial permeability transition pore using cyclosporin A resulted in protective effects similar to those seen with sevoflurane preconditioning, whereas pharmacologically opening the mitochondrial permeability transition pore with atractyloside abrogated all the positive effects of sevoflurane preconditioning and cyclosporin A, including suppression of mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening, counteraction of mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathway, and subsequent histological and behavioral improvements. CONCLUSIONS: Sevoflurane preconditioning protects mitochondria from cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury and ameliorates long-term neurological deficits. Inhibition of mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening is a crucial step in mediating the neuroprotection of sevoflurane preconditioning."

This study examines the molecular mechanism underlying JNK dephosphorylation and inactivation evoked by dual-specificity phosphates following cerebral ischemia. The results revealed upregulation of dual-specificity phosphatase M3/6 (DUSP8) activity at 4 h of reperfusion in rat hippocampi. This was accompanied by the dephosphorylation of JNK. The M3/6 inhibitor, anisomycin, was found to enhance JNK activity following postischemic reperfusion, suggesting that M3/6 is closely associated with JNK inactivation following cerebral ischemia. Cerebral ischemia also induced an increase in heat shock protein (HSP70) levels, which is involved in the upregulation of soluble cytoplasmic M3/6 levels. The inhibition of HSP70 using quercetin resulted in an elevation of JNK activity by decreasing the cytoplasmic solubility of M3/6. The findings of the current study suggest that M3/6 is implicated in the inactivation of JNK in response to cerebral ischemia, which requires the molecular chaperone HSP70 to facilitate the correction of folding defects.

The mechanism through which KB-R7943 confers protection, however, remains controversial. Recently, KB-R7943 has been shown to inhibit mitochondrial calcium uptake and matrix overload, which may contribute to its protective effects. While using KB-R7943 for this purpose, we find here no evidence that KB-R7943 directly blocks mitochondrial calcium uptake. Rather, we find that KB-R7943 inhibits opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore in permeabilized cells and isolated liver mitochondria. Furthermore, we find that this observation correlates with protection against calcium ionophore-induced mitochondrial membrane potential depolarization and cell death, without detrimental effects to basal mitochondrial membrane potential or complex I-dependent mitochondrial respiration. Our data reveal another mechanism through which KB-R7943 may protect against calcium-induced injury, as well as a novel means to inhibit the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. "

These SR processes are regulated by multimeric protein complexes, including protein kinases and phosphatases as well as their anchoring and regulatory subunits that fine-tune Ca-handling in specific SR sub-compartments. SR Ca-transport is mediated by the SR Ca-ATPase (SERCA2a) and its regulatory phosphoprotein, phospholamban (PLN). Dephosphorylated PLN is an inhibitor of SERCA2a and phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA) or calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CAMKII) relieves these inhibitory effects. Recent studies identified additional regulatory proteins, associated with PLN, that control SR Ca-transport. These include the inhibitor-1 (I-1) of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), the small heat shock protein 20 (Hsp20) and the HS-1 associated protein X-1 (HAX1). In addition, the intra-luminal histidine-rich calcium binding protein (HRC) has been shown to interact with both SERCA2a and triadin. Notably, there is physical and direct interaction between these protein players, mediating a fine-cross talk between SR Ca-uptake, storage and release. Importantly, regulation of SR Ca-cycling by the PLN/SERCA interactome does not only impact cardiomyocyte contractility, but also survival and remodeling. Indeed, naturally occurring variants in these Ca-cycling genes modulate their activity and interactions with other protein partners, resulting in depressed contractility and accelerated remodeling. These genetic variants may serve as potential prognostic or diagnostic markers in cardiac pathophysiology. "

There are very few reports available, where expressions of sirtuin isoforms are comprehensively analyzed during neoplasia. Therefore, in the present study, the expression of SIRT1, SIRT2, and SIRT7 during different stages of cervical cancer progression was analyzed. The normal cervical epithelium showed feeble expression of sirtuin isoforms, SIRT1, SIRT2, and SIRT7. A significant increase in SIRT1 expression was noted in the cytoplasm as well as in the nucleus of proliferative layers of cervical epithelium in squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL); however, in the squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), a heterogeneous pattern of SIRT1 expression varying from low to high was noted. A progressive increase in the expression of both SIRT2 and SIRT7 was noted during cancer progression in the following order: normal < preneoplasia < cancer. Cervical cancer cell lines, HeLa and SiHa, showed higher levels of SIRT1 and SIRT2 in comparison to the immortalized cell counterpart, HaCaT. Specific inhibitors of SIRT1 (Ex527) and SIRT2 (AGK2) impaired the growth of the cervical cancer cells, SiHa, but not of the HaCaT cells. SIRT1 inhibition caused cell death, while SIRT2 inhibition resulted in cell cycle arrest. In conclusion, we report the overexpression of SIRT2 and SIRT7 proteins in cervical cancer and suggest probable application of sirtuin inhibitors as therapeutic targets. Further, a specific increase in the levels of SIRT1 in intraepithelial lesion makes it a promising candidate for identification of preneoplastic changes."

This drug is currently undergoing clinical trials for the treatment of secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (MS). Here, we investigated the effects of BAF312 on isolated astrocyte and microglia cultures as well as in slice culture models of demyelination. METHODS: Mouse and human astrocytes were treated with S1PR modulators and changes in the levels of pERK, pAkt, and calcium signalling as well as S1PR1 internalization and cytokine levels was investigated using Western blotting, immunochemistry, ELISA and confocal microscopy. Organotypic slice cultures were prepared from the cerebellum of 10-day-old mice and treated with lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), psychosine and/or S1PR modulators, and changes in myelination states were measured by fluorescence of myelin basic protein and neurofilament H. RESULTS: BAF312 treatment of human and mouse astrocytes activated pERK, pAKT and Ca(2+) signalling as well as inducing S1PR1 internalization. Notably, activation of S1PR1 increased pERK and pAKT in mouse astrocytes while both S1PR1 and S1PR3 equally increased pERK and pAKT in human astrocytes, suggesting that the coupling of S1PR1 and S1PR3 to pERK and pAKT differ in mouse and human astrocytes. We also observed that BAF312 moderately attenuated lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- or TNFalpha/IL17-induced levels of IL6 in both astrocyte and microglia cell cultures. In organotypic slice cultures, BAF312 reduced LPC-induced levels of IL6 and attenuated LPC-mediated demyelination. We have shown previously that the toxic lipid metabolite psychosine induces demyelination in organotypic slice cultures, without altering the levels of cytokines, such as IL6. Importantly, psychosine-induced demyelination was also attenuated by BAF312. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, this study suggests that BAF312 can modulate glial cell function and attenuate demyelination, highlighting this drug as a further potential therapy in demyelinating disorders, beyond MS."

Given the action of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors in targeting tumors with deficiencies in this repair pathway by loss of BRCA1/2, ovarian tumors could be an attractive population for clinical application of this therapy. PARP inhibitors have moved into clinical practice in the past few years, with approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) within the past 2 years. The U.S. FDA approval of olaparib applies to fourth line treatment in germline BRCA-mutant ovarian cancer, and European EMA approval to olaparib maintenance in both germline and somatic BRCA-mutant platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer. In order to widen the ovarian cancer patient population that would benefit from PARP inhibitors, predictive biomarkers based on a clear understanding of the mechanism of action are required. Additionally, a better understanding of the toxicity profile is needed if PARP inhibitors are to be used in the curative, rather than the palliative, setting. We reviewed the development of PARP inhibitors in phase I-III clinical trials, including combination trials of PARP inhibitors and chemotherapy/antiangiogenics, the approval for these agents, the mechanisms of resistance, and the outstanding issues, including the development of biomarkers and the rate of long-term hematologic toxicities with these agents. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor olaparib has recently received approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA), with a second agent (rucaparib) likely to be approved in the near future. However, the patient population with potential benefit from PARP inhibitors is likely wider than that of germline BRCA mutation-associated disease, and biomarkers are in development to enable the selection of patients with the potential for clinical benefit from these agents. Questions remain regarding the toxicities of PARP inhibitors, limiting the use of these agents in the prophylactic or adjuvant setting until more information is available.

In addition, the level of MITF activity determines the phenotype adopted by melanoma cells, whether invasive, proliferative, or differentiated. However, MITF does not act alone. Here, we review literature on the transcription factors that co-regulate MITF-dependent genes. ChIP-seq studies have indicated that the transcription factors SOX10, YY1, and TFAP2A co-occupy subsets of regulatory elements bound by MITF in melanocytes. Analyses at single loci also support roles for LEF1, RB1, IRF4, and PAX3 acting in combination with MITF, while sequence motif analyses suggest that additional transcription factors colocalize with MITF at many melanocyte-specific regulatory elements. However, the precise biochemical functions of each of these MITF collaborators and their contributions to gene expression remain to be elucidated. Analogous to the transcriptional networks in morphogen-patterned tissues during embryogenesis, we anticipate that the level of MITF activity is controlled not only by the concentration of activated MITF, but also by additional transcription factors that either quantitatively or qualitatively influence the expression of MITF-target genes."

This condition is associated with a very high neonatal mortality rate as well as an increased risk of long- and short-term severe neonatal morbidity. The causes of the mid-trimester PPROM are multifactorial. Altered membrane morphology including marked swelling and disruption of the collagen network which is seen with PPROM can be triggered by bacterial products or/and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) have been implicated in the mechanism of PPROM. The propagation of bacteria is an important contributing factor not only in PPROM, but also in adverse neonatal and maternal outcomes after PPROM. Inflammatory mediators likely play a causative role in both disruption of fetal membrane integrity and activation of uterine contraction. The \"classic PPROM\" with oligo/an-hydramnion is associated with a short latency period and worse neonatal outcome compared to similar gestational aged neonates delivered without antecedent PPROM. The \"high PPROM\" syndrome is defined as a defect of the chorio-amniotic membranes, which is not located over the internal cervical os. It may be associated with either a normal or reduced amount of amniotic fluid. It may explain why sensitive biochemical tests such as the Amniosure (PAMG-1) or IGFBP-1/alpha fetoprotein test can have a positive result without other signs of overt ROM such as fluid leakage with Valsalva. The membrane defect following fetoscopy also fulfils the criteria for \"high PPROM\" syndrome. In some cases, the rupture of only one membrane - either the chorionic or amniotic membrane, resulting in \"pre-PPROM\" could precede \"classic PPROM\" or \"high PPROM\". The diagnosis of PPROM is classically established by identification of nitrazine positive, fern positive watery leakage from the cervical canal observed during in specula investigation. Other more recent diagnostic tests include the vaginal swab assay for placental alpha macroglobulin-1 test or AFP and IGFBP1. In some rare cases amniocentesis and infusion of indigo carmine has been used to confirm the diagnosis of PPROM. The management of the PPROM requires balancing the potential neonatal benefits from prolongation of the pregnancy with the risk of intra-amniotic infection and its consequences for the mother and infant. Close monitoring for signs of chorioamnionitis (e.g. body temperature, CTG, CRP, leucocytes, IL-6, procalcitonine, amniotic fluid examinations) is necessary to minimize the risk of neonatal and maternal complications. In addition to delayed delivery, broad spectrum antibiotics of penicillin or cephalosporin group and/or macrolide and corticosteroids have been show to improve neonatal outcome [reducing risk of chorioamnionitis (average risk ratio (RR)=0.66), neonatal infections (RR=0.67) and abnormal ultrasound scan of neonatal brain (RR=0.67)]. The positive effect of continuous amnioinfusion through the subcutaneously implanted perinatal port system with amniotic fluid like hypo-osmotic solution in \"classic PPROM\" less than 28/0 weeks' gestation shows promise but must be proved in future prospective randomized studies. Systemic antibiotics administration in \"pre-PPROM\" without infection and hospitalization are also of questionable benefit and needs to be further evaluated in well-designed randomized prospective studies to evaluate if it is associated with any neonatal benefit as well as the relationship to possible adverse effect of antibiotics on to fetal development and neurological outcome."

The variation of recombination rate at both fine and large scales cannot be fully explained by DNA sequences alone. Epigenetic factors, particularly DNA methylation, have recently been proposed to influence the variation in recombination rate. RESULTS: We study the relationship between recombination rate and gene regulatory domains, defined by a gene and its linked control elements. We define these links using expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTLs), chromatin conformation from publicly available datasets (Hi-C and ChIA-PET), and correlated activity links that we infer across cell types. Each link type shows a \"recombination rate valley\" of significantly reduced recombination rate compared to matched control regions. This recombination rate valley is most pronounced for gene regulatory domains of early embryonic development genes, housekeeping genes, and constitutive regulatory elements, which are known to show increased evolutionary constraint across species. Recombination rate valleys show increased DNA methylation, reduced doublestranded break initiation, and increased repair efficiency, specifically in the lineage leading to the germ line. Moreover, by using only the overlap of functional links and DNA methylation in germ cells, we are able to predict the recombination rate with high accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest the existence of a recombination rate valley at regulatory domains and provide a potential molecular mechanism to interpret the interplay between genetic and epigenetic variations."

Although severe PCI-related events are rare, evidence suggests that PCI-related myocardial infarction and myocardial injury are frequent complications that can impact the clinical prognosis of the patients. Antiplatelet therapy with a potent P2Y12 receptor inhibitor such as ticagrelor may reduce periprocedural ischemic complications while maintaining a similar safety profile as compared with conventional dual antiplatelet therapy by aspirin and clopidogrel in this setting. METHODS: Assessment of Loading with the P2Y12 inhibitor ticagrelor or clopidogrel to Halt ischemic Events in patients Undergoing elective coronary Stenting (ALPHEUS) (NCT02617290) is an international, multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, open-label study in patients with stable coronary artery disease who are planned for an elective PCI. In total, 1,900 patients will be randomized before a planned PCI to a loading dose of ticagrelor 180 mg or a loading dose of clopidogrel (300 or 600 mg) in addition to aspirin. Patients will then receive a dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily or clopidogrel 75 mg once daily for 30 days. The primary ischemic end point is PCI-related myocardial infarction (myocardial infarction type 4a or 4b) or major myocardial injury within 48 hours (or at hospital discharge if earlier) after elective PCI/stent. Safety will be evaluated by major bleeding events (Bleeding Academic Research Consortium type 3 or 5) at 48 hours (or discharge if it occurs earlier).

Currently, it is unclear if progranulin (PGRN) and TMEM106B are synergistically linked and if a gain or a loss of function of TMEM106B is responsible for the increased disease risk of patients with GRN haploinsufficiency.

Grn-/- /Tmem106b-/- mice show a strongly reduced life span and massive motor deficits. Gene expression analysis reveals an upregulation of molecular signature characteristic for disease-associated microglia and autophagy. Dysregulation of maturation of lysosomal proteins as well as an accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and widespread p62 deposition suggest that proteostasis is impaired. Moreover, while single Grn-/- knockouts only occasionally show TDP-43 pathology, the double knockout mice exhibit deposition of phosphorylated TDP-43.

They colonize a large number of patients without invading them. Systemic glucocorticoids are currently used to treat severe Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19). In such patients, opportunistic fungal infections are a problem. Although COVID-19-related pulmonary aspergillosis is becoming more common, mucormycosis is still uncommon. Mucormycosis normally appears 10 to 14 days after being admitted to the hospital. Mucormycosis is a rare but dangerous infection that can make extreme COVID-19 worse. Mucormycosis is more likely to occur in people who have diabetes mellitus and other risk factors. Mucormycosis is most likely exacerbated by concurrent glucocorticoid treatment. To improve outcomes, a high index of suspicion and aggressive management is required. Excessive usage of steroids, monoclonal antibodies, and broad-spectrum antibiotics might cause the formation or worsen of a fungal infection. A high index of suspicion and aggressive management are needed. In patients with COVID-19 infection, physicians should be vigilant of the likelihood of subsequent invasive fungal infections. To enhance results in pulmonary mucormycosis, early diagnosis and treatment are critical. Confirmation of the clinical form necessitates a combination of symptoms that are consistent with tissue invasion histologically. Combining various clinical data and the isolation of the fungus from clinical samples in culture is needed for the probable diagnosis of mucormycosis. The organism that causes mucormycosis is identified using macroscopic and microscopic morphological criteria, carbohydrate assimilation, and the maximum temperature at which they can expand.

In this paper, we focused on familial hypofibrinogenemia, a rare inherited quantitative fibrinogen disorder characterized by decreased fibrinogen levels with a high phenotypic heterogeneity. To begin, we briefly review the basic information regarding fibrinogen's structure, its function, and the clinical consequences of low fibrinogen levels. Thereafter, we introduce 15 case reports with various gene mutations derived from the fibrinogen mutation database GFHT (French Study Group on Hemostasis and Thrombosis), which are associated with congenital hypofibrinogenemia with both bleeding and thrombosis. Predicting clinical presentations based on genotype data is difficult. Genotype-phenotype correlations would be of help to better understand the pathologic properties of this rare disease and to provide a valuable tool for the identification of patients who are not only at risk of bleeding, but also at risk of a thrombotic event."

Although it has been studied extensively in cutaneous melanoma, the role of MITF in uveal melanoma (UM) has not been explored in much detail. We review the literature about the role of MITF in normal melanocytes, in cutaneous melanoma, and in UM. In normal melanocytes, MITF regulates melanocyte development, melanin synthesis, and melanocyte survival. The expression profile and the behaviour of MITF-expressing cells suggest that MITF promotes local proliferation and inhibits invasion, inflammation, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal (EMT) transition. Loss of MITF expression leads to increased invasion and inflammation and is more prevalent in malignant cells. Cutaneous melanoma cells switch between MITF-high and MITF-low states in different phases of tumour development. In UM, MITF loss is associated with loss of BAP1 protein expression, which is a marker of poor prognosis. These data indicate a dual role for MITF in benign and malignant melanocytic cells."

By binding irreversibly to KRASG12C, sotorasib inhibits downstream signalling pathways which are associated with cell growth and differentiation. Sotorasib is indicated for the treatment of adults with advanced, previously treated, KRAS G12C mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in multiple countries, including the countries of the EU and the USA. A clinically relevant objective response rate was observed in patients with KRAS G12C mutation-positive NSCLC during the primary analysis and in an updated analysis of the phase I/II CodeBreaK 100 trial. Furthermore, a clinically relevant response duration was reported in updated analyses of the trial. Sotorasib has a manageable tolerability profile, with permitted dose modifications to manage toxicity. In summary, sotorasib is a promising KRASG12C inhibitor that increases the available treatment options for patients with KRAS G12C mutation-positive NSCLC who were previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy."

Mutated KRAS is a prognostic factor for disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in NSCLC and is associated with a more aggressive clinical phenotype, highlighting the need for KRAS-targeted therapy. Once considered undruggable due to its smooth shallow surface, a breakthrough showed that the activated G12C-mutated KRAS isozyme can be directly inhibited via a newly identified switch II pocket. This discovery led to the development of a new class of selective small-molecule inhibitors against the KRAS G12C isoform. Sotorasib and adagrasib are approved in locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC patients who have received at least one prior systemic therapy. Currently, there are at least twelve KRAS G12C inhibitors being tested in clinical trials, either as a single agent or in combination.

MITF is a key regulator of melanocyte-associated genes, and essential to proper development of the melanocyte cell lineage. Abnormal MITF activity can contribute to the onset of several diseases including melanoma, where MITF is an amplified oncogene. To enhance transcription, MITF recruits the co-activator CREB-binding protein (CBP) and its homolog p300 to gene promoters, however the molecular determinants of their interaction are not yet fully understood. Here, we characterize the interactions between the C-terminal MITF transactivation domain and CBP/p300. Using NMR spectroscopy, protein pulldown assays, and isothermal titration calorimetry we determine the C-terminal region of MITF is intrinsically disordered and binds with high-affinity to both TAZ1 and TAZ2 of CBP/p300. Mutagenesis studies revealed two conserved motifs within MITF that are necessary for TAZ2 binding and critical for MITF-dependent transcription of a reporter gene. Finally, we observe the transactivation potential of the MITF C-terminal region is reliant on the N-terminal transactivation domain for function. Taken together, our study helps elucidate the molecular details of how MITF interacts with CBP/p300 through multiple redundant interactions that lend insight into MITF function in melanocytes and melanoma."

Four porins of known structure were selected as test-cases and their secondary structure delineated. The specificity and sensitivity of 11 methods were separately evaluated. Our critical assessment shows that some secondary structure prediction methods (PHD, Dsc, Sopma) originally designed to predict globular protein structure are useful on porin topology prediction. The overall best prediction is obtained by combining these three \"generalist\" methods with a transmembrane beta strand prediction technique. This \"consensus\" method was applied to Brucella porins Omp2b and Omp2a, sharing no sequence homology with any other porin. The predicted topology is a 16-stranded antiparallel beta barrel with Omp2a showing a higher number of negatively charged residue in the exposed loops than Omp2b. Experiments are in progress to validate the proposed topology and the functional hypotheses.

Mitf plays a fundamental role in melanocyte development, with mice lacking Mitf being entirely devoid of pigment cells. In the absence of functional Mitf protein, melanoblasts expressing Mitf mRNA disappear around 2 days after their first appearance either by apoptosis or by losing their identity and adopting an alternative cell fate. The role of Mitf must therefore be to regulate genes required for melanoblast survival, proliferation, or the maintenance of melanoblast identity. Yet to date, Mitf has been shown to regulate genes such as Tyrosinase, Tyrp-1, and Dct, which are required for pigmentation, a differentiation-specific process. Because expression of these genes cannot account for the complete absence of pigment cells in Mitf-negative mice, Mitf must regulate the expression of other as yet uncharacterized genes. Here we provide several lines of evidence to suggest that Mitf may regulate the expression of the Tbx2 transcription factor, a member of the T-box family of proteins implicated in the maintenance of cell identity. First, isolation and sequencing of the entire murine Tbx2 gene revealed that the Tbx2 promoter contains a full consensus Mitf recognition element; second, Mitf could bind the promoter in vitro and activate Tbx2 expression in vivo in an E box-dependent fashion; and third, Tbx2 is expressed in melanoma cell lines expressing Mitf, but not in a line in which Mitf expression was not detectable. Taken together, with the fact that Tbx2 is expressed in Mitf-positive melanoblasts and melanocytes, but not in Mitf-negative melanoblast precursor cells, the evidence suggests that the Tbx2 gene may represent one of the first known targets for Mitf that is not a gene involved directly in the manufacture of pigment."

The condition is genetically heterogeneous, with at least seven complementation groups (A-G) described. Cells from individuals who are homozygous for mutations in FA genes are characterized by chromosomal instability and hypersensitivity to DNA interstrand crosslinking agents. These features suggest a possible role for the encoded proteins in the recognition or repair of these lesions, but neither their function nor whether they operate in a concerted or discrete functional pathways is known. The recent cloning of the FANCF and FANCE genes has allowed us to investigate the interaction of the proteins encoded by five of the seven complementation groups of FA. We used the yeast two-hybrid system and co-immunoprecipitation analysis to test the 10 possible pairs of proteins for direct interaction. In addition to the previously described binding of FANCA to FANCG, we now demonstrate direct interaction of FANCF with FANCG, of FANCC with FANCE and a weaker interaction of FANCE with both FANCA and FANCG. These findings show that the newly identified FANCE protein is an integral part of the FA pathway, and support the concept of a functional link between all known proteins encoded by the genes that are mutated in this disorder. These proteins may act either as a multimeric complex or by sequential recruitment of subsets of the proteins in a common pathway that protects the genomic integrity of mammalian cells."

We tested this hypothesis for the MOMP of the mouse pneumonitis serovar of Chlamydia trachomatis using two secondary structure prediction methods. First, an algorithm that calculates the mean hydrophobicity of one side of putative beta-strands predicted the positions of 16 transmembrane segments, a structure common to known porins. Second, outer loops typical of porins were assigned using an artificial neural network trained to predict the topology of bacterial outer-membrane proteins with a predominance of beta-strands. A topology model based on these results locates the four variable domains (VDs) of the MOMP on the outer loops and the five constant domains on beta-strands and the periplasmic turns. This model is consistent with genetic analysis and immunological and biochemical data that indicate the VDs are surface exposed. Furthermore, it shows significant homology with the consensus porin model of the program FORESST, which contrasts a proposed secondary structure against a data set of 349 proteins of known structure. Analysis of the MOMP of other chlamydial species corroborated our predicted model."

A subset of JNK can bind to distinct scaffold proteins that also bind upstream kinases of the JNK pathway, allowing sequential kinase activation within a signaling module. The JNK-interacting protein-1 (JIP-1) scaffold protein specifically binds JNK, MAP kinase kinase 7, and members of the MLK family and is essential for stress-mediated JNK activation in neurones. Here we report that JIP-1 also binds the dual-specificity phosphatases MKP7 and M3/6 via a region independent of its JNK binding domain. The C-terminal region of MKP7, homologous to that of M3/6 but not other DSPs, is required for interaction with JIP-1. When MKP7 is bound to JIP-1 it reduces JNK activation leading to reduced phosphorylation of the JNK target c-Jun. These results indicate that the JIP-1 scaffold protein modulates JNK signaling via association with both protein kinases and protein phosphatases that target JNK."

We demonstrate that the inefficient mtDNA replication process of mutant yeast cells lacking the PIF1 DNA helicase is partly rescued in the absence of the DNA helicase RRM3. The rescue effect is likely due to the increase in the deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) pool caused by the lack of RRM3. In contrast, the Pif1p-dependent mtDNA breakage in the presence and absence of genotoxic stress is not suppressed if RRM3 is lacking suggesting that this phenotype is likely independent of the dNTP pool.

We propose that Pif1p that acts likely as a DNA helicase in mitochondria affects mtDNA replication directly. Possible roles of Pif1p include the resolution of secondary DNA and/or DNA/RNA structures, the temporarily displacement of tightly bound mtDNA-binding proteins, or the stabilization of the mitochondrial replication complex during mtDNA replication."

Impairment of the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) function culminates in the accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins in many neurodegenerative conditions including Parkinson's disease (PD). Nevertheless, the cellular mechanisms underlying cell death induced by an impaired UPS are still not clear. Intriguingly, recent studies indicate that several proteins associated with familial PD are capable of promoting the assembly of Lys-63 polyubiquitin chains. Therefore, the objective of this study was to examine the role of K48 and K63 ubiquitination in mitochondria-mediated apoptosis in in vitro models of dopaminergic degeneration. Exposure of the widely used proteasome inhibitor MG-132 to dopaminergic neuronal cell line (N27) induced a rapid accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins in the mitochondria. This appears to result in the preferential association of ubiquitin conjugates in the outer membrane and polyubiquitination of outer membrane proteins. Interestingly, the ubiquitin(K48R) mutant effectively rescued cells from MG-132-induced mitochondrial apoptosis without altering the antioxidant status of cells; whereas the ubiquitin(K63R) mutant augmented the proapoptotic effect of MG-132. Herein, we report a novel conclusion that polyubiquitinated proteins, otherwise subjected to proteasomal degradation, preferentially accumulate in the mitochondria during proteolytic stress; and that polyubiquitination of Lys-48 and Lys-63 are key determinants of mitochondria-mediated cell death during proteasomal dysfunction. Together, these findings yield novel insights into a crosstalk between the UPS and mitochondria in dopaminergic neuronal cells."

The authors compared QOL outcomes following these 2 treatments in a large cohort of children with hydrocephalus by using multivariable statistical techniques to adjust for possible confounder variables. METHODS: The families of children between 5 and 18 years of age with previously treated hydrocephalus at 3 Canadian pediatric neurosurgery centers completed measures of QOL: the Hydrocephalus Outcome Questionnaire (HOQ) and the Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI3). Medical records and recent brain imaging studies were reviewed. A linear regression analysis was performed with the QOL measures as the dependent variable. In multivariable analyses, the authors assessed the independent effect of initial hydrocephalus treatment (ETV vs shunting) while adjusting for the treatment center, current patient age, age at initial treatment, etiology of hydrocephalus, total number of days spent in the hospital for initial treatment, total number of days spent in the hospital for subsequent hydrocephalus complications, functioning ETV at follow-up assessment, frequency of seizures, and current ventricle size. RESULTS: Data from 603 patients were available for analysis. Fifty-eight patients had undergone ETV as their primary treatment and 545 had undergone CSF shunting. Endoscopic third ventriculostomy patients were slightly younger at the follow-up assessment, were older at the first surgery, and spent fewer days in the hospital for hydrocephalus complications. Without adjustment for any confounders, treatment with ETV was associated with significantly higher HOQ physical scores and HUI3 scores. After multivariable adjustment, however, there was no significant difference in any outcome measure. A functioning ETV at the time of the follow-up assessment was not significant in any model. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with either ETV or CSF shunting does not appear to be associated with any substantial difference in QOL outcome after adjusting for prognostic factors.

WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: Green discoloration of the urine from propofol infusion is dose dependent. It is usually benign and reversible, as was the case for our patient."

Traditional neurosurgical outcome measures are crude. Neuropsychological testing is increasingly important in outcome assessment. We investigated the health, disability, lifestyle and cognitive function in adults who had myelomeningocoele closure at birth. METHODS: Adult patients under routine follow-up were assessed in a joint neurosurgery/neuropsychology clinic. Patients completed lifestyle questionnaires, the hydrocephalus outcome questionnaire (HOQ) and underwent cognitive testing. Clinical variables including number of shunt revisions, shunt infection and surgical decompression of foramen magnum, which may influence outcome, were investigated. RESULTS: Twenty-one adults with a median age of 35 years were investigated. All had treated hydrocephalus, and eight had foramen magnum decompression for headache or progressive brainstem symptoms with stabilisation of symptoms in seven and improvement in one. Only eight patients were living independently, five were in paid employment and five work voluntarily. HOQ scores for cognitive function were lower (0.56 +- 0.20; mean +- standard deviation (SD)) than those for physical (0.64 +- 0.15) and social-emotional (0.65 +- 0.17) health. Cognitive function varied across the cohort with attention most severely affected (73.9 +- 17.0; mean +- SD). Repeated episodes of shunt malfunction or foramen magnum decompression were not associated with a worse cognitive function. CONCLUSIONS: Despite intervention in childhood and adequate cerebrospinal fluid diversion the prognosis for independent living into adulthood remains poor. All patients have elements of cognitive impairment. Structural brain abnormalities may be more important determinants of cognitive outcome than shunt malfunction."

It is associated with cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus and decreased longevity. In managing obesity, diet and exercise are essential; pharmacological therapy may be added for obese patients or overweight patients with cardiovascular risk factors. Sibutramine is a serotonergic and adrenergic drug that reduces food intake and increases thermogenesis. It reduces bodyweight by about 4.2 kg after 12 months, and improves blood glucose and lipids; however, it can increase heart rate and blood pressure. In the SCOUT (Sibutramine Cardiovascular OUTcomes) study, sibutramine increased serious cardiovascular events, such as stroke or myocardial infarction, compared with placebo, and was consequently withdrawn from the market. The lesson learnt from this is the importance of patient selection, limiting the duration of treatment and stopping treatment in non-responders. Currently, phentermine and amfepramone (diethylpropion) are approved for short-term treatment of obesity (up to 3 months) and orlistat is approved for longer-term treatment; however, the gastrointestinal adverse effects of orlistat may be intolerable for some patients. There is now a clear need to find anti-obesity drugs that are effective and safe in the long term."

Here, we investigated clinical and biological impacts of histone H3.3 mutations. Forty-two DIPGs were tested for H3.3 mutations. Wild-type versus mutated (K27M-H3.3) subgroups were compared for HIST1H3B, IDH, ATRX and TP53 mutations, copy number alterations and clinical outcome. K27M-H3.3 occurred in 71 %, TP53 mutations in 77 % and ATRX mutations in 9 % of DIPGs. ATRX mutations were more frequent in older children (p < 0.0001). No G34V/R-H3.3, IDH1/2 or H3.1 mutations were identified. K27M-H3.3 DIPGs showed specific copy number changes, including all gains/amplifications of PDGFRA and MYC/PVT1 loci. Notably, all long-term survivors were H3.3 wild type and this group of patients had better overall survival. K27M-H3.3 mutation defines clinically and biologically distinct subgroups and is prevalent in DIPG, which will impact future therapeutic trial design. K27M- and G34V-H3.3 have location-based incidence (brainstem/cortex) and potentially play distinct roles in pediatric GBM pathogenesis. K27M-H3.3 is universally associated with short survival in DIPG, while patients wild-type for H3.3 show improved survival. Based on prognostic and therapeutic implications, our findings argue for H3.3-mutation testing at diagnosis, which should be rapidly integrated into the clinical decision-making algorithm, particularly in atypical DIPG."

The authors report a unique, self-resolving clinical course of this aggressive infection in a 10-month-old infant. The infant was brought to the emergency services in altered sensorium with a 1-week history of left-sided hemiparesis, excessive irritability, and vomiting. An MRI study of the brain revealed multiple, heterogeneously enhancing lesions in the right cerebral hemisphere with mass effect. The largest lesion in the frontotemporal cortical and subcortical regions was decompressed on an emergent basis. Histopathological findings were suggestive of invasive aspergillosis, although there was no evidence of the infection in the lungs or paranasal sinuses. Computed tomography-guided aspiration of the remaining lesions and follow-up antifungal therapy were recommended. The parents, however, requested discharge without further treatment. The child was seen at a follow-up visit 3 years later without having received any antifungal treatment. Imaging showed resolution of the infection and features of Dyke-Davidoff-Masson syndrome (cerebral hemiatrophy). This report of invasive cerebral aspergillosis resolving without medical therapy is the first of its kind. Its clinicoradiological aspects are discussed in light of previously reported cases."

METHODS: (18)F-flutemetamol-labeled amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were used to classify 10 young normal, 15 elderly normal, 20 amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), and 27 AD subjects. MTA+ status was determined using a cut point derived from a previous study, and Am+ status was determined using a conservative and liberal cut point. RESULTS: The rates of MRI scans with positive results among young normal, elderly normal, aMCI, and AD subjects were 0%, 20%, 75%, and 82%, respectively. Using conservative cut points, the rates of Am+ scans for these same groups of subjects were 0%, 7%, 50%, and 93%, respectively, with the aMCI group showing the largest discrepancy between Am+ and MTA+ scans. Among aMCI cases, 80% of Am+ subjects were also MTA+, and 70% of amyloid-negative (Am-) subjects were MTA+. The combination of amyloid PET and MTA data was additive, with an overall correct classification rate for aMCI of 86%, when a liberal cut point (standard uptake value ratio = 1.4) was used for amyloid positivity. INTERPRETATION: (18)F-flutemetamol PET and structural MRI provided additive information in the diagnostic classification of aMCI subjects, suggesting an amyloid-independent neurodegenerative component among aMCI subjects in this sample."

This study aims to investigate the effects and protective mechanism of IPoC on intestinal I/R injury. METHODS: Intestinal I/R was induced by occluding the superior mesenteric artery for 30 min followed by reperfusion for 60 min on male Wistar rats. IPoC was elicited by three cycles of 30-sec reperfusion and reocclusion of superior mesenteric artery at the initiation of reperfusion. Carboxyatractyloside (CATR), a mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opener, and N-methyl-4-isoleucine cyclosporine (NIM811), an mPTP inhibitor, were administered separately in selected groups. The serum and intestinal sections were collected for analysis. RESULTS: IPoC and the administration of NIM811 significantly diminished the expression of intestinal-type fatty acid-binding protein and lactate dehydrogenase (3427+-236.8 U/L for I/R, 1190.5+-36.7 U/L for IPoC, 1399.3+-295.6 U/L for I/R+NIM811, and 2002+-370.9 IU/L for IPoC+CATR) in portal blood, the release of cytosolic cytochrome c, and the cleaved caspase 9 expression in intestinal mucosa after intestinal I/R injury (P<0.05). Histopathologically, IPoC and NIM811 mitigated mucosal damage after I/R as well (Chiu's score, 3.8+-0.4 for I/R, 0.2+-0.2 for IPoC, 0.4+-0.2 for I/R+NIM811, and 4.2+-0.2 for IPoC+CATR; apoptotic index, 59.5%+-4.6% for I/R, 15.7%+-15.7% for I/R+IPoC, 3.5%+-3.5% for I/R+NIM811, and 67.1%+-9.3% in IPoC+CATR). CATR negated the protection conferred by IPoC. CONCLUSIONS: IPoC and NIM811 attenuate intestinal I/R injury.

The median survival of this group of patients after diagnosis is ~1 yr.

Remarkably, we also observed that H3K27me3 and Ezh2 (the catalytic subunit of H3K27 methyltransferase) at chromatin are dramatically increased locally at hundreds of gene loci in H3.3K27M patient cells. Moreover, the gain of H3K27me3 and Ezh2 at gene promoters alters the expression of genes that are associated with various cancer pathways.

Elevated circulating fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23), a known marker of impaired mineral metabolism, may also reflect tubular dysfunction and risk of AKI. This study evaluated FGF-23 as well as traditional markers of kidney disease, namely urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) and creatinine-cystatin C estimated GFR (eGFRCrCyC), as risk factors for AKI in elderly individuals. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: Plasma FGF-23, UACR, and eGFRCrCyC were measured in 3241 community-dwelling elderly individuals in the Cardiovascular Health Study. Hospitalization for AKI was defined by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes. Associations of each biomarker with AKI were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for demographics, cardiovascular risk factors, and biomarkers of kidney function. RESULTS: The mean participant age was 78 years; 60% of participants were women and 16% were African American. The median (interquartile range) values of biomarkers were as follows: FGF-23, 70 RU/ml (53, 99); UACR, 8.88 mg/g (4.71, 20.47); and eGFRCrCyC, 71 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) (59, 83). Hospitalized AKI occurred in 119 participants over 10.0 years of median follow-up. In fully adjusted analyses, compared with the lowest quartiles, the highest quartiles of FGF-23 (>=100 RU/ml) and UACR (>=20.9 mg/g) were associated with AKI (FGF-23: hazard ratio [HR], 1.99; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.04 to 3.80; and UACR: HR, 3.35; 95% CI, 1.83 to 6.13). Compared with the highest quartile, the lowest quartile of eGFRCrCyC (<57 ml/min per 1.73 m(2)) was associated with AKI with an HR of 2.15 (95% CI, 1.21 to 3.82). CONCLUSIONS: FGF-23 adjusted for albuminuria, cardiovascular disease risk factors, and baseline eGFR is independently associated with a higher risk of AKI hospitalizations in community-dwelling elderly individuals. Further studies to understand the nature of this association are warranted."

Although growth hormone deficiency has been suggested as a cause for persistent growth failure in patients with classic Bartter syndrome, in our opinion the diagnoses of growth hormone deficiency has been unconvincing in some reports. Moreover, Gitelman syndrome seems to have been confused with Bartter syndrome in some cases in the literature. In the present work, we describe a new case with CLCNKB gene mutations and review the reported cases of classic Bartter syndrome associated with growth hormone deficiency. CASE PRESENTATION: Our patient was a Japanese boy diagnosed as having classic Bartter syndrome at eight months of age. The diagnosis of Bartter syndrome was confirmed by CLCNKB gene analysis, which revealed compound heterozygous mutations with deletion of exons 1 to 3 (derived from his mother) and DeltaL130 (derived from his father). His medical therapy consisted of potassium (K), sodium chloride, spironolactone, and anti-inflammatory agents; this regime was started at eight months of age. Our patient was very short (131.1cm, -4.9 standard deviation) at 14.3 years and showed profoundly impaired growth hormone responses to pharmacological stimulants: 0.15mug/L to insulin-induced hypoglycemia and 0.39mug/L to arginine. His growth response to growth hormone therapy was excellent. CONCLUSIONS: The present case strengthens the association between classic Bartter syndrome and growth hormone deficiency. We propose that growth hormone status should be considered while treating children with classic Bartter syndrome."

However, few hormone-dependent enhancers have been characterized, and important aspects of their sequence architecture, cell-type-specific activating and repressing functions, or the regulatory roles of their chromatin structure have remained unclear. We used STARR-seq, a recently developed enhancer-screening assay, and ecdysone signaling in two different Drosophila cell types to derive genome-wide hormone-dependent enhancer-activity maps. We demonstrate that enhancer activation depends on cis-regulatory motif combinations that differ between cell types and can predict cell-type-specific ecdysone targeting. Activated enhancers are often not accessible prior to induction. Enhancer repression following hormone treatment seems independent of receptor motifs and receptor binding to the enhancer, as we show using ChIP-seq, but appears to rely on motifs for other factors, including Eip74. Our strategy is applicable to study signal-dependent enhancers for different pathways and across organisms. "

Berardinelli-Seip congenital lipodystrophy type 2 (BSCL2), one of the most severe lipodystrophy diseases, is caused by mutation of the Seipin gene. Seipin plays an important role in adipocyte differentiation and lipid homeostasis, but its exact molecular functions are still unknown. Here, we show that Seipin physically interacts with the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) in both Drosophila and man. SERCA, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium pump, is solely responsible for transporting cytosolic calcium into the ER lumen. Like dSeipin, dSERCA cell-autonomously promotes lipid storage in Drosophila fat cells. dSeipin affects dSERCA activity and modulates intracellular calcium homeostasis. Adipose tissue-specific knockdown of the ER-to-cytosol calcium release channel ryanodine receptor (RyR) partially restores fat storage in dSeipin mutants. Our results reveal that Seipin promotes adipose tissue fat storage by regulating intracellular calcium homeostasis. "

        "text": "Epigenetics and chromatin remodeling play a role in lung disease.\nEpigenetics is defined as heritable changes that affect gene expression without altering the DNA sequence. Epigenetic regulation of gene expression is facilitated through different mechanisms such as DNA methylation, histone modifications and RNA-associated silencing by small non-coding RNAs. All these mechanisms are crucial for normal development, differentiation and tissue-specific gene expression. These three systems interact and stabilize one another and can initiate and sustain epigenetic silencing, thus determining heritable changes in gene expression. Histone acetylation regulates diverse cellular functions including inflammatory gene expression, DNA repair and cell proliferation. Transcriptional coactivators possess intrinsic histone acetyltransferase activity and this activity drives inflammatory gene expression. Eleven classical histone deacetylases (HDACs) act to regulate the expression of distinct subsets of inflammatory/immune genes. Thus, loss of HDAC activity or the presence of HDAC inhibitors can further enhance inflammatory gene expression by producing a gene-specific change in HAT activity. For example, HDAC2 expression and activity are reduced in lung macrophages, biopsy specimens, and blood cells from patients with severe asthma and smoking asthmatics, as well as in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This may account, at least in part, for the enhanced inflammation and reduced steroid responsiveness seen in these patients. Other proteins, particularly transcription factors, are also acetylated and are targets for deacetylation by HDACs and sirtuins, a related family of 7 predominantly protein deacetylases. Thus the acetylation/deacetylation status of NF-kappaB and the glucocorticoid receptor can also affect the overall expression pattern of inflammatory genes and regulate the inflammatory response. Understanding and targeting specific enzymes involved in this process might lead to new therapeutic agents, particularly in situations in which current anti-inflammatory therapies are suboptimal. "

However, the bacterium possesses mechanisms to resist and persist in this environment, in part by its ability to attach to and invade into the gallbladder epithelium. Such persistence in the gallbladder epithelium contributes to chronic carriage. In addition, patients harboring gallstones in their gallbladders have increased risk of becoming carriers because these abnormalities serve as a substrate for Salmonella biofilm formation. Our laboratory has studied the Salmonella interactions in this specific environment by developing in vitro methods that closely mimic the gallbladder and gallstones niches.

METHODS: We conducted a phase 2 study to evaluate the clinical activity of pembrolizumab, an anti-programmed death 1 immune checkpoint inhibitor, in 41 patients with progressive metastatic carcinoma with or without mismatch-repair deficiency. Pembrolizumab was administered intravenously at a dose of 10 mg per kilogram of body weight every 14 days in patients with mismatch repair-deficient colorectal cancers, patients with mismatch repair-proficient colorectal cancers, and patients with mismatch repair-deficient cancers that were not colorectal. The coprimary end points were the immune-related objective response rate and the 20-week immune-related progression-free survival rate. RESULTS: The immune-related objective response rate and immune-related progression-free survival rate were 40% (4 of 10 patients) and 78% (7 of 9 patients), respectively, for mismatch repair-deficient colorectal cancers and 0% (0 of 18 patients) and 11% (2 of 18 patients) for mismatch repair-proficient colorectal cancers. The median progression-free survival and overall survival were not reached in the cohort with mismatch repair-deficient colorectal cancer but were 2.2 and 5.0 months, respectively, in the cohort with mismatch repair-proficient colorectal cancer (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.10 [P<0.001], and hazard ratio for death, 0.22 [P=0.05]). Patients with mismatch repair-deficient noncolorectal cancer had responses similar to those of patients with mismatch repair-deficient colorectal cancer (immune-related objective response rate, 71% [5 of 7 patients]; immune-related progression-free survival rate, 67% [4 of 6 patients]). Whole-exome sequencing revealed a mean of 1782 somatic mutations per tumor in mismatch repair-deficient tumors, as compared with 73 in mismatch repair-proficient tumors (P=0.007), and high somatic mutation loads were associated with prolonged progression-free survival (P=0.02).

Transient epigenetic changes across the entire genome can influence metabolic outcomes and might or might not be heritable. These modifications direct and maintain the cell-type specific gene expression state. Transient epigenetic changes can be driven by DNA methylation and histone modification in response to environmental stressors.

This is achieved by the recruitment of transcriptional co-factors. One of the consequences of co-factor recruitment is the control of specific properties of nucleosomes, the basic units of chromatin, and their protein components, the core histones. The main principles are to regulate the position and the characteristics of nucleosomes. The latter includes modulating the composition of core histones and their variants that are integrated into nucleosomes, and the post-translational modification of these histones referred to as histone marks. One of these marks is the methylation of lysine 4 of the core histone H3 (H3K4). While mono-methylation of H3K4 (H3K4me1) is located preferentially at active enhancers, tri-methylation (H3K4me3) is a mark found at open and potentially active promoters. Thus, H3K4 methylation is typically associated with gene transcription. The class 2 lysine methyltransferases (KMTs) are the main enzymes that methylate H3K4. KMT2 enzymes function in complexes that contain a necessary core complex composed of WDR5, RBBP5, ASH2L, and DPY30, the so-called WRAD complex. Here we discuss recent findings that try to elucidate the important question of how KMT2 complexes are recruited to specific sites on chromatin. This is embedded into short overviews of the biological functions of KMT2 complexes and the consequences of H3K4 methylation."

We conducted a comprehensive assessment of the genetic landscape of 16 whole-genome pairs of tumours and matched PDX, from primary PDAC and liver metastasis, including a unique cohort of 5 'trios' of matched primary tumour, PDX, and PDO. We developed a pipeline to score concordance between PDAC models and their paired human tumours for genomic events, including mutations, structural variations, and copy number variations. Tumour-model comparisons of mutations displayed single-gene concordance across major PDAC driver genes, but relatively poor agreement across the greater mutational load. Genome-wide and chromosome-centric analysis of structural variation (SV) events highlights previously unrecognized concordance across chromosomes that demonstrate clustered SV events. We found that polyploidy presented a major challenge when assessing copy number changes; however, ploidy-corrected copy number states suggest good agreement between donor-model pairs. Collectively, our investigations highlight that while PDXs and PDOs may serve as tractable and transplantable systems for probing the molecular properties of PDAC, these models may best serve selective analyses across different levels of genomic complexity."

However, genetic variations, mainly missense, in GRN have also been linked to other neurodegenerative diseases. We found 12 different pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in 21 patients identified in a cohort of Italian patients affected by various neurodegenerative disorders. We detected the p.Thr272SerfsTer10 as the most frequent, followed by the c.1179+3A>G variant. We characterized the clinical phenotype of 12 patients from 3 pedigrees carrying the c.1179+3A>G variant, demonstrated the pathogenicity of this mutation, and detected other rarer variants causing haploinsufficiency (p.Met1?, c.709-2A>T, p.Gly79AspfsTer39). Finally, by applying bioinformatics, neuropathological, and biochemical studies, we characterized 6 missense/synonymous variants (p.Asp94His, p.Gly117Asp, p.Ala266Pro, p.Val279Val, p.Arg298His, p.Ala505Gly), including 4 previously unreported.

It is associated with an increased morbidity and mortality from diabetes-related complications and a significant treatment burden. However, there has been a substantial progress in therapeutic strategies that can affect the course of the disease. SUMMARY: This review addresses advances in immunotherapy aimed at preserving residual beta-cell function in individuals with a recent onset of T1D, and arresting the disease in pre-symptomatic stages. Recent and ongoing clinical trials have investigated the efficacy and safety of various immunotherapeutic strategies aimed at targeting several mechanisms of autoimmunity, which are thought to be important in disease pathogenesis, and therapies that also address beta cell health. So far, T cell-directed therapies that led to a favourable balance between T effector cell depletion or modulation and preservation or expansion of regulatory T cells have shown the most success. Furthermore, regarding the timing of intervention, teplizumab was the first immunomodulatory agent to demonstrate a significant delay in disease progression in high-risk individuals before clinical onset. KEY MESSAGES: As more targeted immune interventions with potentially fewer side effects are closer to the translation into clinical practice, some new challenges may need to be addressed. The use of combination approaches that include immunotherapeutic strategies targeting different aspects of the immune system and interventions that improve beta cell health may be required, along with the use of individualized patient-tailored approaches, a move towards early intervention, and a focus on patient-reported outcome measures."

KRAS mutations have been linked to adenocarcinoma histology, positive smoking history, and Caucasian ethnicity, although differences have been described across KRAS mutational variants subtypes. KRAS mutations often concur with other molecular alterations, notably TP53, STK11, and KEAP1, which could play an important role in treatment efficacy and patient outcomes. For many years, KRAS mutations have been considered undruggable mainly due to a high toxicity profile and low specificity of compounds. Sotorasib and adagrasib are novel KRAS inhibitors that recently gained FDA approval for pre-treated KRAS mutant NSCLC patients, and other molecules such as GDC-6036 are currently being investigated with promising results. Despite their approval, the efficacy of these drugs is lower than expected and progression among responders has been reported. Mechanisms of acquired resistance to anti-KRAS molecules typically involves either on target secondary mutations (e.g., G12, G13, Q61H, R68S, H95, Y96C, V8L) or off-target alterations. Ongoing trials are currently evaluating strategies for implementing efficacy and overcoming acquired resistance to these compounds. Finally, the efficacy of immune-checkpoint inhibitors still needs to be completely assessed and responses to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 agents may strongly depend on concomitant mutations."

METHODS: Cross-sectional study of a consecutive series of children, followed in a referral multicentric rehabilitation network in Brazil. We invited the caregivers to respond to the Brazilian version of the Caregiver Priorities & Child Health Index of Life with Disabilities (CPCHILDTM) questionnaire. Statistical analysis was performed with the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) 26.0 . We used absolute and relative frequencies for categorical variables and mean and standard deviation for continuous variables. RESULTS: The sample consisted of 193 children, at mean age of 50.3+-7.6 months. We observed a predominance of children with cerebral palsy (CP) with Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) level V (93.7%). Epilepsy (88.4%) was the most common comorbidity. CPCHILDTM mean scores were activities of daily living (ADL)/personal care 43.2+-12.6; positioning, transferring and mobility 33.7+-16.5; comfort and emotions 84.4+-15.2; communication and social interaction (CoSI) 48.2+-24.3; health 70.9+-17.1; and overall quality of life (OQOL) 72.1+-17.1. Total score was 54.8+-11.3. CONCLUSIONS: Among children with cerebral palsy (CP) related to congenital Zika syndrome, the quality of life (QOL) scores were very similar to other populations with cerebral palsy (CP). The activities of positioning, transferring and mobility had the greatest impact on health-related quality of life (QOL).

Although studies have proved that curcumin could inhibit the growth of tumors, its specific molecular mechanism has not yet been fully elucidated. This study aims to systematically elaborate the mechanisms of curcumin against hepatocellular carcinoma. The anti-tumor effect of curcumin was determined by the cell viability test. Flow cytometry was applied to examine the cell cycle and the apoptosis of cancer cells, and the cancer cell migration was detected by wound healing experiments. The expressions of signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) in cancer cells were examined by immunostaining and analyzed by the Image J analysis system. After treatment with curcumin, the apoptosis ratio of HepG2 cells increased significantly (P < 0.05). The proliferation of cancer cells was arrested at the S-phase cell cycle, and the migration of cancer cells was inhibited by the increasing concentration of curcumin, together with the decreasing expressions of STAT3, VEGF, and HIF-1alpha signaling pathways. The results indicate that curcumin could effectively inhibit the growth and migration of hepatocarcinoma cells by inducing cancer cell apoptosis, blocking the cancer cell cycle in the S phase, and reducing the expression of STAT3, VEGF, and HIF-1alpha signaling pathways."

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: To provide confirmatory evidence of the effects of teplizumab on preserving endogenous insulin production, an integrated analysis of C-peptide data from 609 patients (n = 375 patients receiving teplizumab and n = 234 control patients) from five clinical trials in stage 3 type 1 diabetes was conducted. RESULTS: The primary outcome of the integrated analysis, change from baseline in stimulated C-peptide, was significantly improved at years 1 (average increase 0.08 nmol/L; P < 0.0001) and 2 (average increase 0.12 nmol/L; P < 0.0001) after one or two courses of teplizumab. An analysis of exogenous insulin use was also conducted, showing overall reductions of 0.08 (P = 0.0001) and 0.10 units/kg/day (P < 0.0001) at years 1 and 2, respectively. An integrated safety analysis of five clinical trials that enrolled 1,018 patients with stage 2 or 3 type 1 diabetes (~1,500 patient-years of follow-up for teplizumab-treated patients) was conducted. CONCLUSIONS: These data confirm consistency in the preservation of beta-cell function, as measured by C-peptide, across multiple clinical trials. This analysis showed that the most common adverse events included lymphopenia, rash, and headache, a majority of which occurred during and after the first few weeks of teplizumab administration and generally resolved without intervention, consistent with a safety profile characterized by self-limited adverse events after one or two courses of teplizumab treatment."

Common symptoms associated with fibroids include pelvic pain, heavy menstrual bleeding, anemia, and pelvic pressure. These tumors are a leading cause of gynecological care but lack long-term therapy as the origin and development of fibroids are not well understood. Several next-generation sequencing technologies have been performed to identify the underlying genetic and epigenetic basis of fibroids. However, there remains a systemic gap in our understanding of molecular and biological process that define uterine fibroids. Recent epitranscriptomics studies have unraveled RNA modifications that are associated with all forms of RNA and are thought to influence both normal physiological functions and the progression of diseases. We quantified RNA expression profiles by analyzing publicly available RNA-seq data for 15 known epigenetic mediators to identify their expression profile in uterine fibroids compared to myometrium. To validate our findings, we performed RT-qPCR on a separate cohort of uterine fibroids targeting these modifiers confirming our RNA-seq data. We then examined protein profiles of key m 6 A modifiers in fibroids and their matched myometrium. In concordance with our RNA expression profiles, no significant differences were observed in these proteins in uterine fibroids compared to myometrium. To determine abundance of RNA modifications, mRNA and small RNA from fibroids and matched myometrium were analyzed by UHPLC MS/MS. In addition to the prevalent N6-methyladenosine (m 6 A), we identified 11 other known modifiers but did not identify any aberrant expression in fibroids. We then mined a previously published dataset and identified differential expression of m 6 A modifiers that were specific to fibroid genetic sub-type. Our analysis also identified m 6 A consensus motifs on genes previously identified to be dysregulated in uterine fibroids. Overall, using state-of-the-art mass spectrometry, RNA expression and protein profiles, we characterized and identified differentially expressed m 6 A modifiers in relation to driver mutations. Despite the use of several different approaches, we identified limited differential expression of RNA modifiers and associated modifications in uterine fibroids. However, considering the highly heterogenous genomic and cellular nature of fibroids, and the possible contribution of single molecule m 6 A modifications to fibroid pathology, there is a need for greater in-depth characterization of m 6 A marks and modifiers in a larger and varied patient cohort."

Here we introduced the design, statistics and results of a novel profile-based hidden Markov model for the prediction and discrimination of TMBs. The method carefully attempts to avoid over-fitting the sparse experimental data. While our model training and scoring procedures were very similar to a recently published work, the architecture and structure-based labelling were significantly different. In particular, we introduced a new definition of beta- hairpin motifs, explicit state modelling of transmembrane strands, and a log-odds whole-protein discrimination score. The resulting method reached an overall four-state (up-, down-strand, periplasmic-, outer-loop) accuracy as high as 86%. Furthermore, accurately discriminated TMB from non-TMB proteins (45% coverage at 100% accuracy). This high precision enabled the application to 72 entirely sequenced Gram-negative bacteria. We found over 164 previously uncharacterized TMB proteins at high confidence. Database searches did not implicate any of these proteins with membranes.

The regulation of Xist and its antisense partner Tsix remains however poorly understood. We provide here the first evidence of transcriptional control of Xist expression. We show that RNA polymerase II (RNAPolII) preinitiation complex recruitment and H3 Lys 4 (H3-K4) methylation at the Xist promoter form the basis of the Xist expression profiles that drives both imprinted and random XCI. In embryonic stem (ES) cells, which are derived from the inner cell mass where imprinted XCI is reversed and both Xs are active, we show that Xist is repressed at the level of preinitiation complex (PIC) recruitment. We further demonstrate that Tsix, although highly transcribed in ES cells, is not itself responsible for the transcriptional down-regulation of Xist. Rather, Tsix induces efficient H3-K4 methylation over the entire Xist/Tsix unit. We suggest that chromatin remodeling of the Xist locus induced by biallelic Tsix transcription renders both Xist loci epigenetically equivalent and equally competent for transcription. In this model, Tsix, by resetting the epigenetic state of the Xist/Tsix locus, mediates the transition from imprinted to random XCI."

In order to investigate the nature of abnormal survival of endometriotic cells in ectopic locations, we compared drug-induced apoptosis in endometrial and endometriotic cells. METHODS: Endometrial stromal cells were obtained from normal endometrium in 11 patients who underwent hysterectomy for leiomyoma without endometriosis. Endometriotic cells were isolated from the chocolate cyst linings of the ovary in 13 patients who underwent laparoscopic surgery. Cells were cultured in the presence or absence of staurosporine. Apoptotic cell death was evaluated by staining nuclei with propidium iodide and phosphatidylserine (a marker of early apoptotic events) with Annexin V as well as by DNA fragmentation assay. The number of viable cells was estimated by modified MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide WST-8] assay. RESULTS: After 3 h of exposure to staurosporine, >50% of the endometrial stromal cells became Annexin V positive. In contrast, >30% of the endometriotic cells were Annexin V positive. DNA fragmentation was not clearly induced in the endometriotic cells. Less than 20% of the endometrial cells survived after staurosporine exposure, while >40% of the endometriotic cells survived. Cell death induced by staurosporine was partially blocked by incubation with the caspase inhibitor, N-benzyoxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp(OMe)fluoromethyl-ketone (ZVAD-fmk), suggesting that a caspase cascade may play a role in the cell death process. CONCLUSIONS: Attenuated susceptibility to apoptosis in endometriotic stromal cells may be associated with abnormal survival in ectopic sites in an environment that is probably unfavourable. These results may be implicated in the pathophysiology of endometriosis."

Pol II can use a homopolymeric RNA template, can extend RNA by several nucleotides in the absence of DNA, and has been implicated in the replication of the RNA genomes of hepatitis delta virus (HDV) and plant viroids. Here we show the intrinsic RdRP activity of Pol II with only pure polymerase, an RNA template-product scaffold and nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs). Crystallography reveals the template-product duplex in the site occupied by the DNA-RNA hybrid during transcription. RdRP activity resides at the active site used during transcription, but it is slower and less processive than DNA-dependent activity. RdRP activity is also obtained with part of the HDV antigenome. The complex of transcription factor IIS (TFIIS) with Pol II can cleave one HDV strand, create a reactive stem-loop in the hybrid site, and extend the new RNA 3' end. Short RNA stem-loops with a 5' extension suffice for activity, but their growth to a critical length apparently impairs processivity.

Early studies identified a strong association between the MHC class I allele HLA-B*5701 and AHS. These studies suggested that HLA-B*5701 holds promise as a screening test to prevent AHS, but concern arose from HLA-B*5701-negative cases with a clinical diagnosis of AHS, and particularly from early reports of apparently low sensitivities of HLA-B*5701 for AHS in patients of non-White race. However, open screening studies suggested that HLA-B*5701 screening can largely eliminate AHS. Furthermore, skin-patch testing was used in later-generation studies to separate those patients with true immunologically mediated AHS from those with false-positive clinical diagnoses. Currently, high-level evidence suggests that HLA-B*5701 has a negative predictive value of 100% for patch-test-confirmed AHS, which is generalizable across White and Black populations. Current HIV treatment guidelines have been revised to reflect the recommendation that HLA-B*5701 screening be incorporated into routine care for patients who may require abacavir. New laboratory techniques such as PCR and flow cytometric methods, as well as an international quality assurance program, have evolved to ensure the availability of cost-effective screening methods whose consistency and standard can be maintained over time. An elegant body of basic science has evolved, which supports and complements the clinical research in suggesting that AHS is specifically and exquisitely restricted by HLA-B*5701 and mediated by CD8+ lymphocytes. Abrogating factors explaining why 45% of those carrying HLA-B*5701 can tolerate abacavir remain to be defined. The research approach applied to AHS has led to a genetic screening test being successfully implemented globally in primary HIV clinical practice.

One characteristic of FA is an extremely high incidence of cancer, indicating the importance of the FA pathway in tumor suppression. However, the role of this pathway in the development and progression of human cancers in individuals who do not have FA has not been clearly determined. Here, we report that elevated expression of what we believe to be a novel splice variant of FA complementation group L (FANCL), which we identified and named FAVL, can impair the FA pathway in non-FA human tumor cells and act as a tumor promoting factor. FAVL expression was elevated in half of the human carcinoma cell lines and carcinoma tissue samples tested. Expression of FAVL resulted in decreased FANCL expression by sequestering FANCL to the cytoplasm and enhancing its degradation. Importantly, this impairment of the FA pathway by FAVL elevation provided human cancer cells with a growth advantage, caused chromosomal instability in vitro, and promoted tumor development in a xenograft mouse model. These data indicate that FAVL impairment of the FA pathway likely contributes to the development of non-FA human cancers and therefore add a challenging layer of complexity to the pathogenesis of human cancer. We further believe that these data will prove useful for developing additional tools for fighting human cancer."

Recent studies have revealed that several microRNAs (miRNAs) are important components of the p53 tumor suppressor network with miR-125b and miR-504 directly targeting TP53. In this study, we use a screening method to identify that two miRNAs (miR-25 and miR-30d) directly target the 3'UTR of TP53 to downregulate p53 protein levels and reduce the expression of genes that are transcriptionally activated by p53. Correspondingly, both miR-25 and miR-30d adversely affect apoptotic cell death, cell cycle arrest and cellular senescence. Inhibition of either miR-25 or miR-30d expression increases endogenous p53 expression and elevates cellular apoptosis in several cell lines, including one from multiple myeloma that has little TP53 mutations. Thus, beyond miR-125b and miR-504, the human TP53 gene is negatively regulated by two more miRNAs: miR-25 and miR-30d."

Here we show that antamanide inhibits the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, a central effector of cell death induction, by targeting the pore regulator cyclophilin D. Indeed, (i) permeability transition pore inhibition by antamanide is not additive with the cyclophilin D-binding drug cyclosporin A, (ii) the inhibitory action of antamanide on the pore requires phosphate, as previously shown for cyclosporin A; (iii) antamanide is ineffective in mitochondria or cells derived from cyclophilin D null animals, and (iv) abolishes CyP-D peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity. Permeability transition pore inhibition by antamanide needs two critical residues in the peptide ring, Phe6 and Phe9, and is additive with ubiquinone 0, which acts on the pore in a cyclophilin D-independent fashion. Antamanide also abrogates mitochondrial depolarization and the ensuing cell death caused by two well-characterized pore inducers, clotrimazole and a hexokinase II N-terminal peptide. Our findings have implications for the comprehension of cyclophilin D activity on the permeability transition pore and for the development of novel pore-targeting drugs exploitable as cell death inhibitors."

RECENT FINDINGS: Protection against anticitrullinated protein antibody (ACPA) positive RA was shown to be associated wit DRB1*1301. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) added about 10 new loci to the list of already more than 20 loci associated with RA, so the list is now over 30. Typing for the known risk loci is not helpful for prediction of the risk for RA. It is remarkable how few functional studies have been published. SUMMARY: Known genetic factors explain 50-60% of the genetic variance for susceptibility to ACPA-positive and 30-50% for ACPA-negative RA. Searching for the remaining missing or hidden heritability is in all probability not going to yield much for prediction and/or targeted intervention. Therefore, I conclude that if you want to find more genes you should have a lot of patience, time and money, stop with convential GWAS and invest in large-scale sequencing of selected patients and controls. I have a better suggestion, however: use the information that is already available to perform functional studies in order to understand the mechanism of the known associations!"

The expression of CD56, which is a transmembrane molecule, is associated with neuroectodermal differentiation of the embryonal cells. The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression of CD56 in AB, in comparison with other odontogenic cysts. We used formalin-fixed, paraffi n-embedded specimens from 34 cases of AB, 10 cases of keratocystic odontogenic tumor (KCOT), and 7 cases of dentigerous cyst (DC). We immunohistochemically examined CD56, NeuroD1, and N-cadherin expression in these tumors as compared with the expression patterns of various epithelial markers. Seventy-four percent of AB showed immunopositivity for CD56, and both CD56 and N-cadherin were diffusely positive in the outer columnar cells of AB. The immunopositivities for NeuroD1 and N-cadherin were also observed in the outer cells of AB. None of the DC cases was positive for CD56, whereas half the cases of KCOT were positive. Because CD56 is expressed in the inner enamel epithelium of enamel organs, the outer columnar cells of AB are likely to be the differentiation phenotype of the inner enamel epithelium, which is associated with neuroectodermal differentiation. The aberrant NeuroD1 expression may induce CD56 expression in AB and KCOT."

This modification has been linked to the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis (RA). More recently, several studies have suggested that Alzheimer's disease (AD), a devastating neurodegenerative disorder, may have an autoimmune component. In the present study, we have investigated the possibility that expression of PADs and protein citrullination plays a role in the production of brain-reactive autoantibodies that may contribute to Alzheimer's-related brain pathology. Here, we report the selective expression of the PAD isoforms, PAD2 and PAD4, in astrocytes and neurons, respectively, and the concomitant accumulation of citrullinated proteins within PAD4-expressing cells, including neurons of the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. Expression of PADs and citrullinated proteins is prominent in brain regions engaged in neurodegenerative changes typical for AD pathology. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that the pentatricopeptide repeat domain2 (PTCD2) protein, an antigen target of a prominent AD diagnostic autoantibody, is present in a citrullinated form in AD brains. Our results suggest that disease-associated neuronal loss results in the release of cellular contents, including citrullinated proteins, into the brain interstitium. We propose that these citrullinated proteins and their degradation fragments enter into the blood and lymphatic circulation, and some are capable of eliciting an immune response that results in the production of autoantibodies. The long-term and progressive nature of AD and other neurodegenerative diseases results in chronic exposure of the immune system to these citrullinated products and may drive the continual production of autoantibodies."

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects are unknown in human gastric tumor cells. In this study, effects of Dracorhodin perchlorate on cell viability, cell cycle, and apoptosis were investigated in SGC-7901 cells. The results showed that Dracorhodin perchlorate induced cellular and DNA morphological changes and decreased the viability of SGC-7901 cells. Dracorhodin perchlorate-mediated cell cycle arrest was associated with a marked decrease in protein levels of phosphorylated retinoblastoma and E2F1. Dracorhodin perchlorate-induced apoptosis is mediated via upregulation of p53, inhibiting the activation of PI3K/Akt, and NF-kappaB, thereby decreasing the expression of the anti-apoptotic proteins, Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL. Interestingly, we also found that Dracorhodin perchlorate significantly suppressed the IGF-1-induced phosphorylation of Akt in the stably expressing EGFP-Akt recombinant CHO-hIR cells and inhibited TNF-induced NF-kappaB transcriptional activity in the NF-kappaBp65-EGFP recombinant U2OS cells, indicating that inhibition of PI3K/Akt and NF-kappaB may provide a molecular basis for the ability of Dracorhodin perchlorate to induce apoptosis. Dracorhodin perchlorate induced up-regulation of p53, thereby resulting in the activation of its downstream targets p21 and Bax following the dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential and activation of caspase-3 and its substrate, PARP. Moreover, Dracorhodin perchlorate dramatically enhanced the wortmannin- and TNF-induced apoptosis in SGC-7901 cells. These results reveal functional interplay among the PI3K/Akt, p53 and NF-kappaB pathways that are frequently deregulated in cancer and suggest that their simultaneous targeting by Dracorhodin perchlorate could result in efficacious and selective killing of cancer cells."

EC-50 values, as determined by sulforhodamine B assays, varied among the cell types and agents. When normalized to nicotine content, cytotoxicity for WS-CM and TPM was higher compared to that observed with ST/CAS. Nicotine alone had no or only minimal cytotoxicity for all cell types in the applied range. Activation of pro-apoptotic caspase-3 was examined in all cell types at their respective EC-50 doses for the three agents. TPM, but not ST/CAS or WS-CM significantly activated caspase-3 in all three cell types. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) for expression of the early apoptosis marker Annexin V and for nuclear staining by 7-aminoactinomycin (7-AAD) revealed different extents of apoptosis versus non-apoptotic cell death for the three agents. These data characterize differential responses of normal and malignant oral cells after exposure to TPM, ST/CAS, or WS-CM.

A retrospective review of 211 children (794 KCl doses) undergoing cardiac surgery or a hospital stay for heart failure in the CICU of a tertiary care teaching and referral children's hospital in 2011 was performed. Demographic data, weight, height, creatinine, and concomitant medications during each KCl dose were recorded and analyzed. Body surface area (BSA), creatinine clearance, and change in [K(+)] were calculated. The median age of the children was 4 months (range, 10 days-18 years). In this study, 151 KCl doses were administered to neonates (19 %), 307 doses (39 %) to females, and 510 doses (64 %) to patients with a BSA smaller than 0.33 m(2) (a group with relative renal insufficiency). The mean KCl dose was 0.97 +- 0.006 mEq/kg. No adverse events were associated with IV KCl administration. Blood/plasma [K(+)] increased 0.8 +- 0.02 mEq/L. The responses to KCl did not differ significantly between males and females, between neonates and children, or between patients with a BSA smaller than 0.33 m(2) and those with a BSA of 0.33 m(2) or larger. The responses to IV KCl were attenuated by concomitant furosemide (p = 0.01), amphotericin B (p < 0.01), and KCl in parenteral nutrition (p < 0.01). The responses were augmented by concomitant enalapril (p = 0.03), ethacrynic acid (p < 0.001), and hemodialysis (p < 0.01). Intravenous KCl can be administered safely for CICU patients. Responses to KCl are altered when it is given with certain medications. Intravenous KCl should be used cautiously in children receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Future studies are needed for further characterization of factors affecting responses to IV KCl in children."

Along these lines, one mechanism through which E2 protects the hippocampus from cerebral ischemia is by preventing the post-ischemic elevation of Dkk1, a neurodegenerative factor that serves as an antagonist of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, and simultaneously inducing pro-survival Wnt/beta-Catenin signaling in hippocampal neurons. Intriguingly, while expression of Dkk1 is required for proper neural development, overexpression of Dkk1 is characteristic of many neurodegenerative diseases, such as stroke, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and temporal lobe epilepsy. In this review, we will briefly summarize the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, highlight the current literature linking alterations of Dkk1 and Wnt/beta-Catenin signaling with neurological disease, and discuss E2's role in maintaining the delicate balance of Dkk1 and Wnt/beta-Catenin signaling in the adult brain. Finally, we will consider the implications of long-term E2 deprivation and hormone therapy on this crucial neural pathway. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled Hormone Therapy."

Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-7 (IGFBP7) was suggested to function as a tumor suppressor gene in several cancers, and to play a role in the proliferation of keratinocytes. A-to-I RNA editing is a post-transcriptional mechanism frequently used to expand and diversify transcriptome and proteome repertoire in eukaryotic cells. A-to-I RNA editing can alter codons, substitute amino acids and affect protein sequence, structure, and function. Two editing sites were identified within the IGFBP7 transcript. To evaluate the expression and editing of IGFBP7 mRNA in NMSC compared to normal epidermis. We examined the expression and mRNA editing level of IGFBP7 in 22 basal cell carcinoma (BCC), 15 squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and 18 normal epidermis samples that were surgically removed from patients by the Mohs Micrographic Surgery procedure. We studied the effect of IGFBP7 editing on an immortalized HaCaT keratinocyte cell model. IGFBP7 mRNA is over expressed in BCC and SCC compared to normal epidermis. Moreover, the IGFBP7 transcript is highly edited in normal epidermis, but its editing is significantly reduced in BCC and SCC. The edited form of IGFBP7 can inhibit proliferation and induce senescence in cultured keratinocytes. This study describes for the first time A-to-I editing in the coding sequence of a tumor suppressor gene in humans, and suggests that IGFBP7 editing serves as a fine-tuning mechanism to maintain the equilibrium between proliferation and senescence in normal skin.

METHODS: We used 18F-florbetapir F18 PET imaging to quantify neuritic beta-amyloid plaque density across four cortical regions in 602 elderly (55-94 years) subjects from the national ADNI biomarker study. The group comprised of 194 normal elderly, 212 early mild cognitive impairment [EMCI], 132 late mild cognitive impairment [LMCI], and 64 mild Alzheimer's (AD). FINDINGS: In a model incorporating multiple predictive factors, the effect of apolipoprotein E epsilon4 and diagnosis was significant on all four cortical regions. The highest signals were seen in cingulate followed by frontal and parietal with lowest signals in temporal lobe (p<0.0001). The effect of apolipoprotein E epsilon4 (Cohen's D 0.96) on beta-amyloid plaque density was approximately twice as large as the effect of a diagnosis of AD (Cohen's D 0.51) and thrice as large as the effect of a diagnosis of LMCI (Cohen's D 0.34) (p<0.0001). Surprisingly, ApoE epsilon4+ normal controls had greater mean plaque density across all cortical regions than epsilon4- EMCI and epsilon4- LMCI (p<0.0001, p=0.0009) and showed higher, though non-significant, mean value than epsilon4- AD patients (p<0.27). ApoE epsilon4+ EMCI and LMCI subjects had significantly greater mean plaque density across all cortical regions than epsilon4- AD patients (p<0.027, p<0.0001). INTERPRETATION: Neuritic amyloid plaque load across progressive clinical stages of AD varies strongly by ApoE4 genotype. These findings support the need for better pathology-based and supported diagnosis in routine practice. Our data also provides additional evidence for a temporal offset between amyloid deposition and clinically relevant symptoms."

Our aim was to determine whether two courses of teplizumab, an Fc receptor-nonbinding anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody, reduces the decline in C-peptide levels in patients with T1D 2 years after disease onset. We also set out to identify characteristics of responders. We treated 52 subjects with new-onset T1D with teplizumab for 2 weeks at diagnosis and after 1 year in an open-label, randomized, controlled trial. In the intent to treat analysis of the primary end point, patients treated with teplizumab had a reduced decline in C-peptide at 2 years (mean -0.28 nmol/L [95% CI -0.36 to -0.20]) versus control (mean -0.46 nmol/L [95% CI -0.57 to -0.35]; P = 0.002), a 75% improvement. The most common adverse events were rash, transient upper respiratory infections, headache, and nausea. In a post hoc analysis we characterized clinical responders and found that metabolic (HbA1c and insulin use) and immunologic features distinguished this group from those who did not respond to teplizumab. We conclude that teplizumab treatment preserves insulin production and reduces the use of exogenous insulin in some patients with new-onset T1D. Metabolic and immunologic features at baseline can identify a subgroup with robust responses to immune therapy. "

In mouse lung fibroblasts A23187 triggered mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) formation, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, and necrotic cell death that were blocked by cyclosporin A (CsA) and EGTA. LDH release temporally correlated with arachidonic acid release but did not involve cytosolic phospholipase A2alpha (cPLA2alpha) or calcium-independent PLA2. Surprisingly, release of arachidonic acid and LDH from cPLA2alpha-deficient fibroblasts was inhibited by the cPLA2alpha inhibitor pyrrophenone, and another serine hydrolase inhibitor KT195, by preventing mitochondrial calcium uptake. Inhibitors of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, a mitochondrial Ca(2+) uniporter (MCU) regulator, also prevented MPTP formation and arachidonic acid release induced by A23187 and H2O2. Pyrrophenone blocked MCU-mediated mitochondrial calcium uptake in permeabilized fibroblasts but not in isolated mitochondria. Unlike pyrrophenone, the diacylglycerol analog 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol and CsA blocked cell death and arachidonic acid release not by preventing mitochondrial calcium uptake but by inhibiting MPTP formation. In fibroblasts stimulated with thapsigargin, which induces MPTP formation by a direct effect on mitochondria, LDH and arachidonic acid release were blocked by CsA and 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol but not by pyrrophenone or EGTA. Therefore serine hydrolase inhibitors prevent necrotic cell death by blocking mitochondrial calcium uptake but not the enzyme releasing fatty acids that occurs by a novel pathway during MPTP formation. This work reveals the potential for development of small molecule cell-permeable serine hydrolase inhibitors that block MCU-mediated mitochondrial calcium overload, MPTP formation, and necrotic cell death.

We found that AU-rich element RNA binding protein 1 (AUF1) directly binds to the Cry1 3'UTR and regulates translation of Cry1 mRNA. AUF1 interacted with eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit B and also directly associated with ribosomal protein S3 or ribosomal protein S14, resulting in translation of Cry1 mRNA in a 3'UTR-dependent manner. Expression of cytoplasmic AUF1 and binding of AUF1 to the Cry1 3'UTR were parallel to the circadian CRY1 protein profile.

The purpose of our study is to corroborate a preferential association of CCMs and multiple meningiomas in subjects harbouring mutations in the PDCD10 gene (also known as CCM3). Three members of an Italian family affected by seizures underwent conventional brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) with gadolinium contrast agent including gradient echo (GRE) imaging.

Based on neuroradiological and molecular data as well as on literature review, we outline a consistent association between PDCD10 mutations and a syndrome of CCMs with multiple meningiomas. This condition should be considered in the differential diagnosis of multiple/familial meningioma syndromes. In case of multiple/familial meningioma the use of appropriate MRI technique may include GRE and/or susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) to rule out CCM.

The origin of sCJD is unknown, although the initiating event is thought to be the stochastic misfolding of endogenous prion protein (PrP(C)) into infectious PrP(Sc). By contrast, human growth hormone-associated cases of iatrogenic CJD (iCJD) in the United Kingdom (UK) are associated with exposure to an exogenous source of PrP(Sc). In both forms of CJD, heterozygosity at residue 129 for methionine (M) or valine (V) in the prion protein gene may affect disease phenotype, onset and progression. However, the relative contribution of each PrP(C) allotype to PrP(Sc) in heterozygous cases of CJD is unknown. Using mass spectrometry, we determined that the relative abundance of PrP(Sc) with M or V at residue 129 in brain specimens from MV cases of sCJD was highly variable. This result is consistent with PrP(C) containing an M or V at residue 129 having a similar propensity to misfold into PrP(Sc) thus causing sCJD. By contrast, PrP(Sc) with V at residue 129 predominated in the majority of the UK human growth hormone associated iCJD cases, consistent with exposure to infectious PrP(Sc) containing V at residue 129. In both types of CJD, the PrP(Sc) allotype ratio had no correlation with CJD type, age at clinical onset, or disease duration. Therefore, factors other than PrP(Sc) allotype abundance must influence the clinical progression and phenotype of heterozygous cases of CJD."

Endoscopic indices used for UC were then correlated with different clinical and histological indices to find the strongest correlations. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: A high correlation was demonstrated between three of the 11 evaluated clinical indices - Improvement Based on Individual Symptom Scores, Ulcerative Colitis Disease Activity Index, and Schroeder Index - and all nine endoscopic indices - Ulcerative Colitis Endoscopic Index of Severity, Baron Score, Schroeder Index, Feagan Index, Powell-Tuck Index, Rachmilewitz Index, Sutherland Index, Lofberg Index, and Lemman Index. Improvement Based on Individual Symptom Scores was the index with the highest correlation with all the endoscopic indices used for UC. The above indices are recommended for clinical evaluation of UC activity. The Ulcerative Colitis Endoscopic Index of Severity was moderately correlated with a histological index, and it is therefore recommended for routine endoscopic mucosal evaluation in patients with UC."

        "text": "Rucaparib in relapsed, platinum-sensitive high-grade ovarian carcinoma (ARIEL2 Part 1): an international, multicentre, open-label, phase 2 trial.\nBACKGROUND: Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors have activity in ovarian carcinomas with homologous recombination deficiency. Along with BRCA1 and BRCA2 (BRCA) mutations genomic loss of heterozygosity (LOH) might also represent homologous recombination deficiency. In ARIEL2, we assessed the ability of tumour genomic LOH, quantified with a next-generation sequencing assay, to predict response to rucaparib, an oral PARP inhibitor. METHODS: ARIEL2 is an international, multicentre, two-part, phase 2, open-label study done at 49 hospitals and cancer centres in Australia, Canada, France, Spain, the UK, and the USA. In ARIEL2 Part 1, patients with recurrent, platinum-sensitive, high-grade ovarian carcinoma were classified into one of three predefined homologous recombination deficiency subgroups on the basis of tumour mutational analysis: BRCA mutant (deleterious germline or somatic), BRCA wild-type and LOH high (LOH high group), or BRCA wild-type and LOH low (LOH low group). We prespecified a cutoff of 14% or more genomic LOH for LOH high. Patients began treatment with oral rucaparib at 600 mg twice per day for continuous 28 day cycles until disease progression or any other reason for discontinuation. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival. All patients treated with at least one dose of rucaparib were included in the safety analyses and all treated patients who were classified were included in the primary endpoint analysis. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01891344. Enrolment into ARIEL2 Part 1 is complete, although an extension (Part 2) is ongoing. FINDINGS: 256 patients were screened and 206 were enrolled between Oct 30, 2013, and Dec 19, 2014. At the data cutoff date (Jan 18, 2016), 204 patients had received rucaparib, with 28 patients remaining in the study. 192 patients could be classified into one of the three predefined homologous recombination deficiency subgroups: BRCA mutant (n=40), LOH high (n=82), or LOH low (n=70). Tumours from 12 patients were established as BRCA wild-type, but could not be classified for LOH, because of insufficient neoplastic nuclei in the sample. The median duration of treatment for the 204 patients was 5 7 months (IQR 2 8-10 1). 24 patients in the BRCA mutant subgroup, 56 patients in the LOH high subgroup, and 59 patients in the LOH low subgroup had disease progression or died. Median progression-free survival after rucaparib treatment was 12 8 months (95% CI 9 0-14 7) in the BRCA mutant subgroup, 5 7 months (5 3-7 6) in the LOH high subgroup, and 5 2 months (3 6-5 5) in the LOH low subgroup. Progression-free survival was significantly longer in the BRCA mutant (hazard ratio 0 27, 95% CI 0 16-0 44, p<0 0001) and LOH high (0 62, 0 42-0 90, p=0 011) subgroups compared with the LOH low subgroup. The most common grade 3 or worse treatment-emergent adverse events were anaemia or decreased haemoglobin (45 [22%] patients), and elevations in alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase (25 [12%]). Common serious adverse events included small intestinal obstruction (10 [5%] of 204 patients), malignant neoplasm progression (10 [5%]), and anaemia (nine [4%]). Three patients died during the study (two because of disease progression and one because of sepsis and disease progression). No treatment-related deaths occurred. INTERPRETATION: In patients with BRCA mutant or BRCA wild-type and LOH high platinum-sensitive ovarian carcinomas treated with rucaparib, progression-free survival was longer than in patients with BRCA wild-type LOH low carcinomas. Our results suggest that assessment of tumour LOH can be used to identify patients with BRCA wild-type platinum-sensitive ovarian cancers who might benefit from rucaparib. These results extend the potential usefulness of PARP inhibitors in the treatment setting beyond BRCA mutant tumours.

        "text": "Nucleolin phosphorylation regulates PARN deadenylase activity during cellular stress response.\nNucleolin (NCL) is an abundant stress-responsive, RNA-binding phosphoprotein that controls gene expression by regulating either mRNA stability and/or translation. NCL binds to the AU-rich element (ARE) in the 3'UTR of target mRNAs, mediates miRNA functions in the nearby target sequences, and regulates mRNA deadenylation. However, the mechanism by which NCL phosphorylation affects these functions and the identity of the deadenylase involved, remain largely unexplored. Earlier we demonstrated that NCL phosphorylation is vital for cell cycle progression and proliferation, whereas phosphorylation-deficient NCL at six consensus CK2 sites confers dominant-negative effect on proliferation by increasing p53 expression, possibly mimicking cellular DNA damage conditions. In this study, we show that NCL phosphorylation at those CK2 consensus sites in the N-terminus is necessary to induce deadenylation upon oncogenic stimuli and UV stress. NCL-WT, but not hypophosphorylated NCL-6/S*A, activates poly (A)-specific ribonuclease (PARN) deadenylase activity. We further demonstrate that NCL interacts directly with PARN, and under non-stress conditions also forms (a) complex (es) with factors that regulate deadenylation, such as p53 and the ARE-binding protein HuR. Upon UV stress, the interaction of hypophosphorylated NCL-6/S*A with these proteins is favored. As an RNA-binding protein, NCL interacts with PARN deadenylase substrates such as TP53 and BCL2 mRNAs, playing a role in their downregulation under non-stress conditions. For the first time, we show that NCL phosphorylation offers specificity to its protein-protein, protein-RNA interactions, resulting in the PARN deadenylase regulation, and hence gene expression, during cellular stress responses."

        "text": "3D Power Doppler vascular indices as a novel technique in assessing the outcome of minimally invasive techniques in uterine fibroids treatment.\nUterine fibroids are considered to be the most frequent female benign tumours. The most common reported symptoms of fibroids are heavy menstrual bleeding and painful menstruation, pelvic pain, urinary problems, constipation, as well as infertility and recurrent pregnancy loss. The mainstay of fibroid treatment is surgery, but nowadays minimally-invasive techniques are growing in popularity. Vascularity of fibroids may play a role in the outcome of these techniques, which is why it is important to find an objective, reproducible technique to measure the vascularization before and after the procedure. The 3D Power Doppler vascular indices (3DPDVI) allow objective assessment of vascularization in the entire volume of the tumour. Initially this technique was mostly used in experimental imaging phantoms, but recently many studies focus on the clinical utility of this technique. Power Doppler allows to obtain information on vascularity in the area of interest, while 3DPDVI can be objectively calculated by the Virtual Organ Computer-aided AnaLysis (VOCAL ) software. 3DPDVI showed high reproducibility in most of the studies. This technique has an important role in monitoring the outcome of minimally invasive procedures in fibroid treatment, because they affect vascularity of the tumours. Although there are some limitations of 3DPDVI, it seems that their application may be an effective tool in objective assessment of vascularity of fibroids. However further studies are required to consolidate the usage of 3DPDVI in clinical practice."

In 3-month rat (90 mg/kg/day) and 9-month mouse (25 and 75 mg/kg/day) in vivo mechanistic studies, vascular endothelial cell (VEC) activation was observed in both species, but VEC proliferation and persistent increases in circulating placental growth factor 2 (PLGF2) were only seen in the mouse. In mice, these effects were sustained over the 9-month study duration, while in rats increased mitotic gene expression was present at day 3 only and PLGF2 was induced only during the first week of treatment. In the mouse, the persistent VEC activation, mitosis induction, and PLGF2 stimulation likely led to sustained neo-angiogenesis which over life-long treatment may result in HSA formation. In rats, despite sustained VEC activation, the transient mitotic and PLGF2 stimuli did not result in the formation of HSA. In vitro, the mouse and rat primary endothelial cell cultures mirrored their respective in vivo findings for cell proliferation and PLGF2 release. Human VECs, like rat cells, were unresponsive to siponimod treatment with no proliferative response and no release of PLGF2 at all tested concentrations. Hence, it is suggested that the human cells also reproduce a lack of in vivo response to siponimod. In conclusion, the molecular mechanisms leading to siponimod-induced HSA in mice are considered species specific and likely irrelevant to humans."

        "text": "An Overview of Recent Advances and Clinical Applications of Exon Skipping and Splice Modulation for Muscular Dystrophy and Various Genetic Diseases.\nExon skipping is a therapeutic approach that is feasible for various genetic diseases and has been studied and developed for over two decades. This approach uses antisense oligonucleotides (AON) to modify the splicing of pre-mRNA to correct the mutation responsible for a disease, or to suppress a particular gene expression, as in allergic diseases. Antisense-mediated exon skipping is most extensively studied in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and has developed from in vitro proof-of-concept studies to clinical trials targeting various single exons such as exon 45 (casimersen), exon 53 (NS-065/NCNP-01, golodirsen), and exon 51 (eteplirsen). Eteplirsen (brand name Exondys 51), is the first approved antisense therapy for DMD in the USA, and provides a treatment option for ~14% of all DMD patients, who are amenable to exon 51 skipping. Eteplirsen is granted accelerated approval and marketing authorization by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), on the condition that additional postapproval trials show clinical benefit. Permanent exon skipping achieved at the DNA level using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) technology holds promise in current preclinical trials for DMD. In hopes of achieving clinical success parallel to DMD, exon skipping and splice modulation are also being studied in other muscular dystrophies, such as Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy (FCMD), dysferlinopathy including limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B (LGMD2B), Miyoshi myopathy (MM), and distal anterior compartment myopathy (DMAT), myotonic dystrophy, and merosin-deficient congenital muscular dystrophy type 1A (MDC1A). This chapter also summarizes the development of antisense-mediated exon skipping therapy in diseases such as Usher syndrome, dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP), and allergic diseases."

Here, we examined the pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of DS-8201a and DXd in cynomolgus monkeys, a cross-reactive species. Following intravenous (iv) administration of DS-8201a, the linker was stable in plasma, and systemic DXd exposure was low. DXd was rapidly cleared following iv dosing. Biodistribution studies revealed that intact DS-8201a was present mostly in the blood without tissue-specific retention. The major pathway of excretion for DXd was the faecal route following iv administration of radiolabelled DS-8201a. The only detectable metabolite in the urine and faeces was unmetabolized DXd. DXd is a substrate of organic anion transporting polypeptides, P-gp, and breast cancer resistance protein. In conclusion, the stable linker in circulation and the high clearance of DXd upon release resulted in the low systemic exposure to DXd. Furthermore, the minimal tissue-specific retention and rapid excretion of DXd into faeces as its unmetabolized form with potentially limited impact on drug - drug interaction as a victim were also critical elements of the PK profile of DS-8201a."

        "text": "Epimutations driven by small RNAs arise frequently but most have limited duration in Caenorhabditis elegans.\nEpigenetic regulation involves changes in gene expression independent of DNA sequence variation that are inherited through cell division. In addition to a fundamental role in cell differentiation, some epigenetic changes can also be transmitted transgenerationally through meiosis. Epigenetic alterations (epimutations) could thus contribute to heritable variation within populations and be subject to evolutionary processes such as natural selection and drift. However, the rate at which epimutations arise and their typical persistence are unknown, making it difficult to evaluate their potential for evolutionary adaptation. Here, we perform a genome-wide study of epimutations in a metazoan organism. We use experimental evolution to characterize the rate, spectrum and stability of epimutations driven by small silencing RNAs in the model nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We show that epimutations arise spontaneously at a rate approximately 25 times greater than DNA sequence changes and typically have short half-lives of two to three generations. Nevertheless, some epimutations last at least ten generations. Epimutations mediated by small RNAs may thus contribute to evolutionary processes over a short timescale but are unlikely to bring about long-term divergence in the absence of selection."

As a result of limitations in current diagnostics, guidelines recommend early antimicrobials for suspected sepsis patients to improve outcomes at a cost to antimicrobial stewardship. We aimed to develop and prospectively validate a new, 29-messenger RNA blood-based host-response classifier Inflammatix Bacterial Viral Non-Infected version 2 (IMX-BVN-2) to determine the likelihood of bacterial and viral infections. DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING: Emergency Department, Campus Benjamin Franklin, Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Germany. PATIENTS: Three hundred twelve adult patients presenting to the emergency department with suspected acute infections or sepsis with at least one vital sign change. INTERVENTIONS: None (observational study only). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Gene expression levels from extracted whole blood RNA was quantified on a NanoString nCounter SPRINT (NanoString Technologies, Seattle, WA). Two predicted probability scores for the presence of bacterial and viral infection were calculated using the IMX-BVN-2 neural network classifier, which was trained on an independent development set. The IMX-BVN-2 bacterial score showed an area under the receiver operating curve for adjudicated bacterial versus ruled out bacterial infection of 0.90 (95% CI, 0.85-0.95) compared with 0.89 (95% CI, 0.84-0.94) for procalcitonin with procalcitonin being used in the adjudication. The IMX-BVN-2 viral score area under the receiver operating curve for adjudicated versus ruled out viral infection was 0.83 (95% CI, 0.77-0.89). CONCLUSIONS: IMX-BVN-2 demonstrated accuracy for detecting both viral infections and bacterial infections. This shows the potential of host-response tests as a novel and practical approach for determining the causes of infections, which could improve patient outcomes while upholding antimicrobial stewardship."

Herein, for the first time, an implantable polymer-based nanofiber matrix is developed for postoperative tumor management by promoting wound healing and preventing cancer recurrence. The multifunctional matrix is successfully prepared by assembling chitosan-stabilized Se nanoparticles (SeNPs) at the surface of polydopamine (PDA) modified poly(epsilon-caprolactone)/curcumin fibres (PCL/CUR), denoted as PCL/CUR/PDA@Se. In this system, PDA as functionalized layers coated onto the PCL/CUR surface favors the effective immobilization of SeNPs through a covalent bond, as well as acts as a gatekeeper guaranteeing the sustained release of CUR. The CUR/SeNPs present excellent antitumor efficacy, respectively, which supports the nanocomposite matrix to efficiently kill cancer cells in vitro by inducing mitochondrial dysfunction caused by the ROS overproduction, and significantly suppressing the tumor growth in vivo. Additionally, due to the synergistic antioxidant activity of CUR and SeNPs, the nanofibrous matrix distinctly facilitates the adhesion and proliferation of normal fibroblast cells, and simultaneously accelerates wound healing during tumor treatments in tumor-bearing mice. These results suggest that the PCL/CUR/PDA@Se matrix with bifunctional properties is a promising candidate for local tumor-wound therapy. This work offers an innovative strategy to develop new improved post-surgery therapies for cancer patients."

The deposition and roles of these modifications in coding and noncoding RNAs are summarized in detail. Based on the RNA modification background, this review summarized the expression, function, and underlying molecular mechanism of these modifications and their regulators in cancer and further discussed the role of some existing small-molecule inhibitors. More in-depth studies on RNA modification and cancer are needed to broaden the understanding of epigenetics and cancer diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis."

The current disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) limit disease progression primarily by dampening immune cell activity in the peripheral blood or hindering their migration from the periphery into the CNS. New therapies are needed to target CNS immunopathology, which is a key driver of disability progression in MS. This article reviews Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (BTKIs), a new class of experimental therapy that is being intensely evaluated in MS. We focus on the potential peripheral and central mechanisms of action of BTKIs and their use in recent clinical trials in MS. RECENT FINDINGS: There is evidence that some BTKIs cross the blood-brain barrier and may be superior to currently available DMTs at dampening the chronic neuroinflammatory processes compartmentalized within the CNS that contribute to progressive worsening in people withMS (pwMS). Recently, evobrutinib and tolebrutinib have shown efficacy in phase II clinical trials, and there are numerous ongoing phase III clinical trials of various BTKIs in relapsing and progressive forms of MS. Results from these clinical trials will be essential to understand the efficacy and safety of BTKIs across the spectrum of MS and keydifferences between specific BTKIs when treating pwMS. Inhibition of BTK has emerged as an attractive strategy to target cells of the adaptive and innate immune system outside and within the CNS. BTKIs carry great therapeutic potential across the MS spectrum, where key pathobiology aspects seem confined to the CNS compartment."

Here, we report on a patient with metastatic NSCLC with a concurrent ROS1 fusion and KRAS p.G12C mutation at diagnosis who experienced a short duration of disease control on entrectinib, a ROS1 TKI. At progression, the patient continued entrectinib and started sotorasib, a small molecule inhibitor of KRAS p.G12C. A patient-derived cell line generated at progression on entrectinib demonstrated improved TKI responsiveness when treated with entrectinib and sotorasib. Cell-line growth dependence on both ROS1 and KRAS p.G12C was further reflected in the distinct downstream signaling pathways activated by each driver. Clinical benefit was not observed with combined therapy of entrectinib and sotorasib possibly related to an evolving KRAS p.G12C amplification identified on repeated molecular testing. This case supports the need for broad molecular profiling in patients with metastatic NSCLC for potential therapeutic and prognostic information."

Meanwhile, news of a new deadly fungus has surfaced known as Mucormycosis (Black fungus). Mucormycosis is a fungal infection that invades the blood vessels and is caused by Mucormycetes, a group of fungi. Due to the post-pandemic effect of COVID-19 many fungal and bacterial diseases have affected the population. The reason behind the frequent development of opportunistic infections like mucormycosis is the use of steroids, oxygen masks, and antibiotics throughout the treatment of critically and severely ill patients with COVID-19. Inhaling filamentous fungi from the natural environment and a lack of supportive care units can be a risk factor for mucormycosis. It is usually found in people who are immunocompromised. Mucormycosis is more common in people with HIV/AIDS, COVID-19, congenital bone marrow disease, viral diseases, malignancies, severe burns, and irregularly or untreated and treated diabetes. This review emphasizes triggers that may precipitate mucormycosis related to corticosteroids, recent epidemiology, and incidence of mucormycosis. The infection was diagnosed and identified using a variety of cutting-edge medical techniques, including clinical diagnosis, histopathology, and serology. Many treatment methods, such as antifungal medications and therapies, have also been successfully used. The mortality rate, however, remains high due to an aggressive surgical excision or debridement and lack of early diagnosis."

A clinicopathologic study including MIB1 immunoreactivity.\nOBJECTIVE: To examine the etiology of and clinicopathologic findings associated with meningioangiomatosis and to evaluate MIB1 immunoreactivity (marker of cell proliferation) in this lesion. DESIGN: Retrospective surgical pathology series of three patients. SETTING: Tertiary referral center with a high volume of epilepsy surgery. PATIENTS: Individuals with meningioangiomatosis who underwent surgical resection of the lesion. RESULTS: Three patients aged 11, 14, and 32 years (two females, one male) comprise the study. All patients presented with a history of intractable seizures (2, 3, and 30 years duration). None of the patients had von Recklinghausen's disease. All three patients underwent gross total resection of the lesion, and postoperative seizure-free intervals range from 7 to 15 months. Histologically, the lesion is characterized by a proliferation of blood vessels and meningothelial cells arranged around vessels in the meninges, cortex, and underlying white matter. Psammoma body formation or dystrophic mineralization and gliosis of the intervening parenchyma was observed in all three cases. Bodian stains failed to demonstrate neurofibrillary tangles within intervening parenchymal neurons. Focal epithelial membrane antigen positivity was observed in two lesions and was absent in one. MIB1 staining was observed in two lesions (MIB1 index = 0.8 and 0.6) within the meningothelial cell nuclei and was absent in one case. CONCLUSIONS: Meningioangiomatosis is a rare malformative or hamartomatous lesion of the central nervous system characterized by a proliferation of vessels and perivascular cuffs of meningothelial cells. Absent MIB1 immunoreactivity or low MIB1 indices in the lesion support the clinical impression of a slow-growing lesion and further support a malformative or hamartomatous etiology."

This study examined three cultured meningiomas, in which surface observation of psammoma bodies might be easier than in the tumor tissues since influence of interposing connective tissue is minimized in tissue culture. Early culture revealed that psammoma bodies with frank calcification were suspended in the tissue culture medium, and so were they collected, centrifuged, and then processed for electron microscopy. Ultrastructurally, psammoma bodies were mostly spherical in shape and composed of a core of dense calcification and surrounding collagen fiber bundles. Apart from psammoma bodies, round bodies with concentric lamination like a transversely cut onion were frequently noted by light microscopy. These bodies were composed mainly of tangles of collagen fibers emerged from surrounding tumor cell processes. The results suggest that psammoma bodies in meningiomas arise in part from meningothelial whorls due to collagen production by tumor cells followed by obliteration and disappearance of tumor cell processes, although some of the alternative pathways for psammoma body formation proposed by other investigators cannot be ruled out by this study."

In this paper, we describe a method for the immunogold-labeling of biotin-conjugated Annexin V, to detect apoptotic thymocytes at electron microscopy. Etoposide-treated thymocytes were reacted in tissue culture medium with biotin-conjugated Annexin V, fixed with glutaraldehyde, and processed for resin embedding; thin sections were incubated with antibiotin antibodies coupled with colloidal gold. Cytometric estimates of the apoptotic index were also performed by evaluating either the DNA content after propidium iodide staining or the light-scattering values, as well as the positivity for fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-biotin antibodies. At electron microscopy, gold-labeling of Annexin V was located on the plasma membrane only of apoptotic thymocytes and on cytoplasmic debris, likely resulting from the typical apoptotic blebbing. Unlabeled thymocytes always showed normal, non-apoptotic nuclear morphology. The application of Annexin V labeling at electron microscopy will allow a more refined description of the morphological events occurring during apoptosis."

The relative contributions of hyperprolactinemia-induced hypogonadism and the prolactin (PRL) excess per se have been unclear from clinical studies. To determine the effects of PRL excess, two models of chronic hyperprolactinemia were used. In one, mild hyperprolactinemia was produced in rats bearing extra anterior pituitary glands under the kidney capsule. Severe hyperprolactinemia was produced by subcutaneously transplanting the PRL-secreting MMQ tumor into other rats. To control for estrogen deficiency, the rats were ovariectomized. In some experiments, estrogen replacement was provided. Urinary calcium excretion was increased in hyperprolactinemic rats compared with controls, regardless of severity of PRL excess and estrogen status. This suggested that PRL excess itself had some effect on calcium balance. More importantly, however, the spinal bone mineral density (BMD; measured by dual-energy x-ray densitometry) of mildly hyperprolactinemic ovariectomized rats was the same as control ovariectomized rats. Similarly, tibial dry weight and ash weight were affected by the estrogen status, but not by the severe PRL excess of the tumor-implanted rats. Thus, despite the evidence for an increase in urinary calcium excretion in hyperprolactinemic rats, estrogen deficiency is much more important in determining bone mineral. Therefore, the present data indicate that the osteoporosis of hyperprolactinemia is likely due to PRL-induced hypogonadism, rather than a direct effect of PRL on calcium homeostatis."

Trophinin and tastin, however, do not directly bind to each other, suggesting the presence of an intermediary protein. The present study identifies a cytoplasmic protein, named bystin, that directly binds trophinin and tastin. Bystin consists of 306 amino acid residues and is predicted to contain tyrosine, serine, and threonine residues in contexts conforming to motifs for phosphorylation by protein kinases. Database searches revealed a 53% identity of the predicted peptide sequence with the Drosophila bys (mrr) gene. Direct protein-protein interactions of trophinin, tastin, and bystin analyzed by yeast two-hybrid assays and by in vitro protein binding assays indicated that binding between bystin and trophinin and between bystin and tastin is enhanced when cytokeratin 8 and 18 are present as the third molecule. Immunocytochemistry of bystin showed that bystin colocalizes with trophinin, tastin, and cytokeratins in a human trophoblastic teratocarcinoma cell, HT-H. It is therefore possible that these molecules form a complex and thus are involved in the process of embryo implantation."

A retrospective review of 20 cases.\nSTUDY DESIGN: A retrospective review of 20 patients with incidental durotomy treated without mandatory bed rest. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether patients with incidental durotomy can be treated effectively without multiple days of bed rest. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Incidental durotomy can cause postural headaches, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, photophobia, tinnitus, and vertigo. These symptoms are believed to result from a decrease in cerebrospinal fluid pressure, leading to traction on the supporting structures of the brain. Traditional management includes bed rest for up to 7 days to eliminate traction and reduce hydrostatic pressure during the healing process. METHODS: Twenty incidental durotomies were repaired intraoperatively with dural stitches and fibrin glue. Patients were allowed to ambulate according to the natural course after surgery without mandatory bed rest. Symptoms were monitored closely for 1 week, and long-term follow-up assessments were obtained at a minimum of 10 months. RESULTS: Of the 20 patients in this study, 75% had no symptoms after repair of the incidental durotomy. Each of the dural tears was 1-3 mm in length. Two patients reported headache, two reported nausea, and one reported tinnitus; no patients experienced vomiting. One patient (5%) had stitch loosening requiring revision surgery. There were no additional serious complications. CONCLUSIONS: This study has shown that the majority of patients with incidental durotomy can be treated effectively with dural stitches and fibrin glue. Patients can be permitted to ambulate immediately after surgery but should be cautioned to lay flat if they develop symptoms. This will reduce the costs related to the hospital stay and missed work."

        "text": "[Novel potential uses of thalidomide in the management of pain? A review of the literature].\nThalidomide was introduced as a sedative and antiemetic agent to the European market in the late 1950s. However, it soon became clear that a hitherto unheard-of incidence of severe birth defects was due to the maternal use of thalidomide and the drug was withdrawn from the market. Despite its teratogenesis, thalidomide is currently being rediscovered because of its known spectrum of anticachectic, antiemetic, mildly hypnotic, anxiolytic, anti-inflammatory, antiangiogenic, and analgesic properties. The mechanism of action of thalidomide is probably based on its immunomodulatory effect, namely the suppression of production of tumor necrosis factor alpha and the modulation of interleukins. A striking but not well-known finding is the effectiveness of thalidomide as an analgesic or analgesic adjuvant. During the early era of thalidomide use, the drug was shown to enhance the analgesic efficacy of a combined treatment with acetylsalicylic acid, phenacetin, and caffeine (APC) by testing \"normal volunteers, using electrical stimulation of teeth.\" The combination of thalidomide and APC was superior to other combinations (APC alone, APC and codeine) with respect to both the total analgesic effect and the duration of this analgesic effect. In 1965 thalidomide was found to be effective in treating the painful subcutaneous manifestations of the leprosy-associated erythema nodosum leprosum, a condition for which it eventually was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration in 1998. In an animal model of neuropathic pain (chronic constriction injury), thalidomide was shown to reduce both mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia. Recent studies documented the analgesic efficacy of thalidomide in treating painful mucocutaneous aphthous ulcers associated with HIV syndrome and Behcet's disease.However, to date there are no recent clinical trials that are specifically designed to explore the analgesic potential of thalidomide. In view of the current basic research and clinical findings,we suggest to investigate the potential benefits of thalidomide in severe pain conditions that respond poorly to common pain management approaches such as neuropathic pain, postherpetic neuralgia, or central pain phenomena. Because its mechanism of action is distinct from that of other drugs such as steroids, thalidomide offers the possibility of a combined treatment with other agents with nonoverlapping toxicities. We conclude that thalidomide, when used properly,may enrich the therapeutic regimen in the management of some pain-related conditions."

        "text": "Aortic Intramural Hematoma: Current Diagnostic and Therapeutic Recommendations.\nAortic intramural hematoma (IMH) is an acute, potentially lethal disorder that is similar to but pathologically distinct from acute aortic dissection. Although hemorrhage into the aortic media occurs in both disorders, an intimal tear with resultant false lumen is not present in IMH. Instead, hemorrhage occurs within the aortic wall either due to rupture of the vasa vasorum or, less commonly, because of an atherosclerotic penetrating aortic ulcer. The most common risk factors associated with IMH are hypertension, atherosclerosis, and advanced age. IMH is life-threatening because the hematoma may extend along or rupture through the aorta, leading to hemothorax, cardiac tamponade, stroke, mesenteric ischemia, or renal insufficiency. Optimal treatment is still somewhat controversial; however, there is no question that hypertension must be treated effectively and immediately. This is usually best accomplished by intravenous infusion of beta-blocking agents, with or without the addition of sodium nitroprusside. Recent studies support surgical treatment (ie, aortic root replacement) for IMH involving the ascending aorta, although some subsets of this population may be at lower risk and may benefit from medical therapy alone. In patients with IMH involving only the descending aorta, medical therapy alone is recommended (unless impending rupture, aortic aneurysm, or end-organ ischemia occurs). Patients who survive the acute event require intensive treatment of hypertension and frequent follow-up examinations. Because this population (especially the subset with penetrating aortic ulceration) is at high risk for aortic aneurysm and rupture, serial imaging studies of the aorta are essential."

Existing diagnostic methods are in many cases insufficient for proper diagnosis and choice of treatment method. In 10% cases of inflammatory bowel disease indeterminate colitis (IC) is described. It includes cases with diverse clinical manifestations, range and histopathological picture. New methods to distinguish inflammatory bowel diseases, chose proper treatment and monitor their activity are searched. Anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA) and antineutrophil cytoplasmatic antibodies (pANCA) seem to be a new markers used in this end. OBJECTIVE: Comparison of ASCA and pANCA appearance in CD and UC searching of correlation between serum levels of antibodies, activity and clinical picture of disease and appearance of ASCA and pANCA in IC. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We examined 63 patients with UC aged 24 to 74 (30 men and 33 women), 14 patients with CD aged 27 to 64 (10 men and 4 women) and 11 patients with IC aged 21 to 53 (4 men and 7 women). Mean duration time of diseases respectively for UC, CD and IC was 7.9 (from 1.0 to 32), 9 (from 1 to 20) and 3.04 (0.5 to 7) years. Diagnosis in specific clinical picture was established with endoscopic and histopathologic examination. Disease activity was described according to Rachmilewitz scale in UC and in CD according to Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI). Control group consisted of 24 healthy men. Examination of pANCA, IgA and IgG ACSA was performed with ELISA kits respectively by Congent Diagnostics and Genesis Diagnostic. RESULTS: There were 39 of UC patients and of CD patients with active disease according to Rachmilewitz scale (above 3 points) and CDAI. We observed statistically more often pANCA in patients with UC (58%; n=31) than in patients with CD (28%; n=4) (p<0.05). Both IgA and IgG ACSCA occurred more often in patients with CD (57%; n=8) than in patients with UC (24%; n=15) (p<0.05). There were no significant differences between antibodies according to duration time, activity, location and treatment method of diseases. Obtained results besides the help with understanding of pathologic mechanisms, indicate for use of antibodies as an diagnostic tool in inflammatory bowel diseases."

These three quantitative trait loci (QTL) on NZB chromosomes 1, 7, and 13 differentially regulated three different autoimmune traits: anti-nuclear autoantibody production, gp70-anti-gp70 immune complex (gp70 IC) formation, and glomerulonephritis. Contributions to the disease traits were further confirmed by generating and analyzing three different B6.Yaa congenic mice, each carrying one individual NZB QTL. The chromosome 1 locus that overlapped with the previously identified Nba2 (NZB autoimmunity 2) locus regulated all three traits. A newly identified chromosome 7 locus, designated Nba5, selectively promoted anti-gp70 autoantibody production, hence the formation of gp70 IC and glomerulonephritis. B6.Yaa mice bearing the NZB chromosome 13 locus displayed increased serum gp70 production, but not gp70 IC formation and glomerulonephritis. This locus, called Sgp3 (serum gp70 production 3), selectively regulated the production of serum gp70, thereby contributing to the formation of nephritogenic gp70 IC and glomerulonephritis, in combination with Nba2 and Nba5 in NZB mice. Among these three loci, a major role of Nba2 was demonstrated, because B6.Yaa Nba2 congenic male mice developed the most severe disease. Finally, our analysis revealed the presence in B6 mice of an H2-linked QTL, which regulated autoantibody production. This locus had no apparent individual effect, but most likely modulated disease severity through interaction with NZB-derived susceptibility loci."

This study demonstrated that while autoradiographic methods provided anatomic precision and regional resolution, the homogenate binding method for site occupancy assessment yielded comparable sensitivity with markedly improved throughput. For ex vivo binding assays, the reduction of temperature and time during the in vitro process (primarily incubation with a radioligand) markedly decreased the dissociation of test agents from binding sites in brain tissues. This reduction, in turn, minimized the potential for underestimation of site occupancy in vivo especially for test compounds with affinity >10nM. The ratios of measured occupancy ED(50) values (doses at which 50% occupancy occurs) among SERT, NET and DAT sites for duloxetine, venlafaxine, nomifensine, indatraline, DOV 21,947 and DOV 216,303 were consistent with the ratios of the in vitro affinities between these target binding sites.

The Brn-2 (N-Oct-3, POU3F2) transcription factor also regulates melanoma proliferation and is up-regulated by BRAF and beta-catenin, two key melanoma-associated signaling molecules.

Patients with diabetes and related vascular complications also have an increased incidence of low thyroid function. While thyroid hormones (THs) may be key regulators of a healthy vasculature, potential undesirable side effects hinder their use in the treatment of vascular disorders. TH analogs such as 3,5-diiodothyropropionic acid (DITPA) may provide a safer treatment option. However, the relative potency of DITPA on vascular growth, cardiac function, and metabolism is poorly understood. We hypothesized that the vascular growth-promoting effects of DITPA can be obtained with a minimum effect on cardiac function. Thyroidectomized Sprague-Dawley rats were given slow-release pellets with either thyroxine (T4, 2.7 or 5.2 mg) or DITPA (80 mg) for 6 wk and were compared with placebo. Heart mass, body mass, body temperature, serum THs, cardiac function (echocardiograms and hemodynamics), and myocardial arteriolar density were determined. Hypothyroidism led to reductions in cardiac function, heart mass, body temperature, and myocardial arterioles. High-dose T4 prevented arteriolar loss and the development of hypothyroidism. Low-dose T4 partially prevented the reduction in cardiac function but had minimal effects on arteriolar loss. In contrast, DITPA treatment prevented myocardial arteriolar loss but not the progression of hypothyroid-induced changes in cardiac function. The results suggested that DITPA can promote a healthy vasculature independently from its thyroid-related metabolic effects. Drugs in this class may provide new therapeutic options for patients with vascular disease."

This strongly predictive genetic association, which in many respects represents a test case for the clinical application of pharmacogenetics, highlights the fine specificity of HLA-restricted immunity, here directed against a drug-specific antigen rather than an allogeneic molecule (as occurs in transplantation) or a pathogenic organism (as in viral infection). However, this example also demonstrates that successful implementation of pharmacogenetic screening requires that a range of criteria be adequately addressed. These include pharmaceutical factors (e.g. lack of alternative treatments with similar or improved cost effectiveness, safety, and efficacy), clinical factors (e.g. accurate diagnosis of the adverse event, in this case provided by clinical diagnostic criteria and adjunctive epicutaneous patch testing), sufficient objective evidence of the test's predictive value and generalizability (in this case provided by the first large-scale randomized trial of a pharmacogenetic test), as well as availability of quality-assured laboratory services that are responsive to the needs of targeted genetic screening.

BoNT/B is produced by Clostridium botulinum, and it is secreted along with a group of neurotoxin-associated proteins (NAPs) in the form of a BoNT/B complex. The complex dissociates into a 150-kDa holotoxin and NAPs at alkaline pHs. The 150-kDa BoNT/B holotoxin can be nicked to produce a 50-kDa domain referred to as the light chain (LC) and a 100-kDa heavy chain, with the former possessing a unique endopeptidase activity. The two chains remain linked through a disulfide bond that can be reduced to separate the two chains. The endopeptidase activity is present in all three forms of the toxin (complex, purified BoNT/B holotoxin, and separated light chain), which are used by different researchers to develop detection methods and screen for inhibitors. In this research, the endopeptidase activities of the three forms, for the first time, were compared under the same conditions. The results show that enzyme activities of the three forms differ significantly and are largely dependent on nicking and disulfide reduction conditions. Under the conditions used, LC had the highest level of activity, and the complex had the lowest. The activity was enhanced by nicking of BoNT/B holotoxin and was enhanced even more by dithiothreitol (DTT) reduction after nicking. This information is useful for understanding the properties of BoNT endopeptidases and for comparing the efficacies of different inhibitors when they are tested with different forms of BoNT endopeptidase."

However, conflicting results have been reported for the cardiac effects of DITPA. Importantly, recent clinical trials demonstrated no symptomatic benefit in patients with DITPA despite some improved hemodynamic and metabolic parameters. To address these issues, dose-dependent effects of DITPA were investigated in mice for baseline cardiovascular effects and postischemic myocardial function and/or salvage. Mice were treated with subcutaneous DITPA at 0.937, 1.875, 3.75, or 7.5 mg kg(-1) day(-1) for 7 days, and the results were compared with untreated mice for ex vivo and/or in vivo myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I/R). DITPA had no effects on baseline body temperature, body weight, or heart rate; however, it mildly increased blood pressure. In isolated hearts, baseline contractile function was significantly impaired in DITPA-pretreated mice; however, postischemic recovery was comparable between untreated and DITPA-treated groups. In vivo baseline cardiac parameters were significantly affected by DITPA, with increased ventricular dimensions and decreased contractile function. Importantly, DITPA-treated mice demonstrated high prevalence of fatal cardiac rhythm abnormalities during in vivo ischemia and/or reperfusion. There were no improvements in myocardial infarction and postischemic fractional shortening with DITPA. Myocardial sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA), phospholamban (PLB), and heat shock protein (HSP) levels remained unchanged with DITPA treatment.

We sought to describe the natural history of this disorder, specifically its clinical presentation, disease course and long-term health status impact using the validated, disease-specific Hydrocephalus Outcome Questionnaire (HOQ). METHODS: An inception cohort of children >5 and <18 years old, with a history of BEH was assembled by ICD-9 and a key word search of medical and radiology records. Review confirmed the diagnosis of BEH, excluded major medical comorbidities and assessed presentation, radiographic features and head size/growth velocity. The HOQ was administered by mail. RESULTS: We identified 99 patients, 5-12 years old (55% males). Twenty were born prematurely, 12 with <33 weeks gestation. Children presented at an average age of 9 +- 4.8 months (mean +- SD). The presenting complaint was macrocephaly in 65 cases. Other presenting findings were positional head shape deformity and torticollis; 10% had a family history of macrocephaly. Developmental delay was present in 21% of patients (4% verbal, 20% gross motor, 4% fine motor delay). Four patients had small subdural hematomas, none with suspicion of a non-accidental trauma. During clinical reassessment over a mean follow-up of 13 months, the average head percentile was stable and none of the patients developed new subdural hematomas. Gross motor delay resolved in 15/20 and fine motor delay in 4/4 patients. Verbal delay resolved in 2/4 patients, but interestingly, was newly detected in 6 other children. None of the patients required cerebrospinal fluid shunting. The response rate to the HOQ was 25% (median age 7 years, 74% females). The average overall HOQ score was 0.75 +- 0.24 versus 0.68 +- 0.19 for a previously published cohort of shunted hydrocephalic children. CONCLUSIONS: BEH patients in this series generally saw resolution of presenting motor developmental delays; however, new verbal delays were detected in a non-trivial number of patients. Quality of life measurements suggest some reduction in health status, but less so than is seen with shunted hydrocephalus."

Although global DNA demethylation has been observed after treatment, it is unclear to what extent demethylation induces changes in nucleosome occupancy, a key determinant of gene expression. We use the colorectal cancer cell line HCT116 as a model to address this question and determine that <2% of regions demethylated by 5-Aza-CdR treatment assume an open configuration. Consolidating our findings, we detect nucleosome retention at sites of global DNA methylation loss in DKO1, an HCT116-derived non-tumorigenic cell-line engineered for DNA methyltransferase disruption. Notably, regions that are open in both HCT116 cells after treatment and in DKO1 cells include promoters belonging to tumor suppressors and genes under-expressed in colorectal cancers. Our results indicate that only a minority of demethylated promoters are associated with nucleosome remodeling, and these could potentially be the epigenetic drivers causing the loss of tumorigenicity. Furthermore, we show that the chromatin opening induced by the histone deacetylase inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid has strikingly distinct targets compared with those of 5-Aza-CdR, providing a mechanistic explanation for the importance of combinatorial therapy in eliciting maximal de-repression of the cancer epigenome."

Herein, we report that EpCAM regulates the composition and function of tight junctions (TJ). EpCAM accumulated on the lateral interfaces of human colon carcinoma and normal intestinal epithelial cells but did not co-localize with TJ. Knockdown of EpCAM in T84 and Caco-2 cells using shRNAs led to changes in morphology and adhesiveness. TJ formed readily after EpCAM knockdown; the acquisition of trans-epithelial electroresistance was enhanced, and TJ showed increased resistance to disruption by calcium chelation. Preparative immunoprecipitation demonstrated that EpCAM bound tightly to claudin-7. Co-immunoprecipitation documented associations of EpCAM with claudin-7 and claudin-1 but not claudin-2 or claudin-4. Claudin-1 associated with claudin-7 in co-transfection experiments, and claudin-7 was required for association of claudin-1 with EpCAM. EpCAM knockdown resulted in decreases in claudin-7 and claudin-1 proteins that were reversed with lysosome inhibitors. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that claudin-7 and claudin-1 continually trafficked into lysosomes. Although EpCAM knockdown decreased claudin-1 and claudin-7 protein levels overall, accumulations of claudin-1 and claudin-7 in TJ increased. Physical interactions between EpCAM and claudins were required for claudin stabilization. These findings suggest that EpCAM modulates adhesion and TJ function by regulating intracellular localization and degradation of selected claudins."

And is it time to move on?\nPURPOSE OF REVIEW: The aim is to examine a dominant narrative in nephrology over the past decade: that measured glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is the gold standard measure of kidney function; accurate assessment of GFR is critical and paramount; and further efforts to refine GFR estimation should continue. RECENT FINDINGS: Studies that have simultaneously compared measured GFR and estimated GFR (using endogenous filtration markers such as creatinine, or newer ones such as cystatin C or beta-trace protein) against some external metric of kidney function have failed to show that measured GFR is consistently superior, which is what one would expect if measured GFR were truly the 'gold standard.' SUMMARY: Compared with estimated GFR, measured GFR does not consistently predict renal-related outcomes better. Clinical decision-making almost never requires precise and accurate knowledge of a patient's static GFR value. Efforts at perfecting cross-sectional estimates of GFR may have reached a point of diminishing returns."

As a monogenic disease affecting the hematopoietic system, CGD is amenable to gene therapy. Indeed in a phase I/II clinical trial, we demonstrated a transient resolution of bacterial and fungal infections. However, the therapeutic benefit was compromised by the occurrence of clonal dominance and malignant transformation demanding alternative vectors with equal efficacy but safety-improved features. In this work we have developed and tested a self-inactivating (SIN) gammaretroviral vector (SINfes.gp91s) containing a codon-optimized transgene (gp91(phox)) under the transcriptional control of a myeloid promoter for the gene therapy of the X-linked form of CGD (X-CGD). Gene-corrected cells protected X-CGD mice from Aspergillus fumigatus challenge at low vector copy numbers. Moreover, the SINfes.gp91s vector generates substantial amounts of superoxide in human cells transplanted into immunodeficient mice. In vitro genotoxicity assays and longitudinal high-throughput integration site analysis in transplanted mice comprising primary and secondary animals for 11 months revealed a safe integration site profile with no signs of clonal dominance."

Annexin-V modified substrate was constructed via layer-by-layer (LBL) method for specific capture of early stage apoptotic Jurkat cells. A new kind of aminophenylboronic acid modified gold nanoparticle (APBA-GNP) was synthesized and utilized for labeling cells, followed by silver enhancement. Anodic stripping voltammetry (ASV) was applied to sensitive detection of Ag(+) dissolved from the deposited silver particles, which reflected the number of cells. A good linear range from 1 x 10(2) to 3.5 x 10(3) cells was achieved, with a detection limit of 38 apoptotic cells. Moreover, the gray color of silver enhancement could be observed by the naked eye, which could be used to tell apoptotic cells apart from normal cells. Therefore, using the silver-enhanced GNP label method, apoptotic cells could not only be sensitively detected via electrochemical technique, but also can be discriminated from normal cells by the naked eye."

DATA SOURCES: A search of PubMed (January 2004-May 2013) and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (January 2004-May 2013) using the search terms bedaquiline, diarylquinoline, R207910, and TMC207 was performed. Supplementary sources included proceedings of the Union World Conference on Lung Health. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Preclinical data as well as Phase 1 and 2 studies published in English were evaluated. DATA SYNTHESIS: Bedaquiline possesses a unique mechanism of action that disrupts the activity of the mycobacterial adenosine triphosphate synthase. Clinical trials have been conducted evaluating the use of bedaquiline in combination with a background regimen for the treatment of adults with pulmonary MDR-TB. Bedaquiline has an excellent in vitro activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, including multidrug resistant M tuberculosis; however, its side effect profile limits its use against MDR-TB when no other effective regimen can be provided. Bedaquiline carries Black Box warnings for increased risk of unexplained mortality and QT prolongation. Bedaquiline is metabolized via the CYP3A4 isoenzyme and thus interacts with rifamycins and several antiretrovirals. CONCLUSIONS: In an era of emerging resistance and given the suboptimal efficacy and toxicity of currently available regimens for MDR-TB, bedaquiline represents a great addition to the existing armamentarium of anti-TB agents particularly in areas of the world where the disease is endemic."

We sought to determine reasons for TI, the characteristics of patients undergoing TI, and the relationship between anticoagulant and outcomes among patients with TI. METHODS AND RESULTS: In the Rivaroxaban Once Daily, Oral, Direct Factor Xa Inhibition Compared With Vitamin K Antagonism for Prevention of Stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation (ROCKET AF), a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy study of rivaroxaban and warfarin in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, baseline characteristics, management, and outcomes, including stroke, non-central nervous system systemic embolism, death, myocardial infarction, and bleeding, were reported in participants who experienced TI (3-30 days) for any reason. The at-risk period for outcomes associated with TI was from TI start to 30 days after resumption of study drug. In 14 236 participants who received at least 1 dose of study drug, 4692 (33%) experienced TI. Participants with TI were similar to the overall ROCKET AF population in regard to baseline clinical characteristics. Only 6% (n=483) of TI incidences involved bridging therapy. Stroke/systemic embolism rates during the at-risk period were similar in rivaroxaban-treated and warfarin-treated participants (0.30% versus 0.41% per 30 days; hazard ratio [confidence interval]=0.74 [0.36-1.50]; P=0.40). Risk of major bleeding during the at-risk period was also similar in rivaroxaban-treated and warfarin-treated participants (0.99% versus 0.79% per 30 days; hazard ratio [confidence interval]=1.26 [0.80-2.00]; P=0.32). CONCLUSIONS: TI of oral anticoagulation is common and is associated with substantial stroke risks and bleeding risks that were similar among patients treated with rivaroxaban or warfarin. Further investigation is needed to determine the optimal management strategy in patients with atrial fibrillation requiring TI of anticoagulation.

METHODS: Here, we present two pediatric cases of pontine oligodendroglial tumors with radiological findings atypical for diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma. RESULTS: The first patient was an 8-year-old boy. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated diffuse high-intensity changes in the pons, left middle cerebellar peduncle, and part of the left cerebellar hemisphere on T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images, with an enhanced spot lesion in the left cerebellar hemisphere. The pathological diagnosis was anaplastic oligodendroglioma, and we identified a mutation in histone H3.3 in the tumor specimen. He succumbed to massive disseminated relapse 7 months from diagnosis despite local radiation therapy. The second patient, a 2-year-old girl, was diagnosed with oligoastrocytoma. Brain MRI revealed a large mass in her rostral pons extended to the fourth ventricle with obstructive hydrocephalus. The tumor recurred with intracranial dissemination 56 months post-surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric brainstem oligodendroglial tumors can include histone H3.3-mutated tumors and have a tendency to disseminate throughout the neuroaxis at the time of relapse."

METHODS: Eighty-three consecutive adult patients (50 men; mean age 60 years) with newly diagnosed supratentorial primary glioblastomas that underwent surgical resection with intraoperative carmustine wafers implantation (n = 7.1 +- 1.7) were retrospectively studied. RESULTS: The median overall survival (OS) was 15.8 months with 56 patients dying over the course of the study. There was no significant association between the number of implanted carmustine wafers and complication rates (four surgical site infections, one death). The OS was significantly longer in Stupp regimen patients (19.5 months) as compared with patients with other postoperative treatments (13 months; p = 0.002). In addition patients with eight or more implanted carmustine wafers survived longer (24.5 months) than patients with seven or less implanted wafers (13 months; p = 0.021). Finally, regardless of the number of carmustine wafers, median OS was significantly longer in patients with a subtotal or total resection (21.5 months) than in patients with a partial resection (13 months; p = 0.011). CONCLUSIONS: The intraoperative use of carmustine wafers in combination with Stupp regimen is a viable first-line treatment option of glioblastomas. The prognostic value of this treatment association should be evaluated in a multicenter trial, ideally in a randomized and placebo-controlled one."

The conversion of mature B cell lymphomas to Langerhans cell neoplasms is not well documented. Three previous reports have described clonally related follicular lymphoma and Langerhans cell tumours, whereas no case has been published of clonally related marginal zone lymphoma and Langerhans cell sarcoma. We describe the case of a 77-year-old patient who developed a Langerhans cell sarcoma and 6 years later a nodal marginal zone lymphoma. Mutation status examination showed 100 % gene identity to the germline sequence, suggesting direct trans-differentiation or dedifferentiation of the nodal marginal zone lymphoma to the Langerhans cell sarcoma rather than a common progenitor. We found inactivation of paired box 5 (PAX-5) in the lymphoma cells by methylation, along with duplication of part of the long arm of chromosomes 16 and 17 in the sarcoma cells. The absence of PAX-5 could have triggered B cells to differentiate into macrophages and dendritic cells. On the other hand, chromosomal imbalances might have activated genes involved in myeloid lineage maturation, transcription activation and oncogenesis. We hypothesize that this occurred because of previous therapies for nodal marginal zone lymphoma. Better understanding of this phenomenon may help in unravelling the molecular interplay between transcription factors during haematopoietic lineage commitment and may expand the spectrum of clonally related mature B cell neoplasms and Langerhans cell tumours."

In the present study, we investigated the anti-apoptotic effects of ex-4, as well as the potential mechanisms responsible for these effects in rat bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) under conditions of oxygen, glucose and serum deprivation (OGD). The apoptosis of the MSCs was induced by subjecting the cells to OGD conditions for 4 h and was detected by Annexin V/PI and Hoechst 33258 staining. The MSCs were pre-conditioned with ex-4 for 12 h prior to being subjected to OGD conditions, and the expression levels of an apoptotic marker (cleaved caspase-3), endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress markers [phosphorylated (p-)protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), PERK, binding immunoglobulin protein (BIP), activating transcription factor 4 (ATF-4) and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP)], as well as those of a survival marker (Bcl-2) were measured by western blot analysis. Furthermore, the mRNA levels of ATF-4 and CHOP were determined by RT-qPCR. ELISA was used to examine the activity of intracellular cAMP. Moreover, the GLP-1R antagonist, exendin9-39 (ex9-39), the protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor, H89, and small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting rat ATF-4 and CHOP were co-incubated with the MSCs. The apoptotic rate was markedly diminished following pre-conditioning with ex-4 in a dose-dependent manner (P<0.05). The ER stress markers, p-PERK, BIP, ATF-4 and CHOP, were upregulated in the cells subjected to OGD conditions. Ex-4 pre-conditioning significantly decreased the mRNA and protein levels of ATF-4 and CHOP (P<0.05), and increased the activity of intracellular cAMP (P<0.05). Furthermore, the anti-apoptotic effects of ex-4 were almost reversed by treatment with either H89 or ex9-39 (P<0.05); transfection with siRNA-CHOP significantly reduced the apoptotic rate of the MSCs and did not impair the cytoprotective effects of ex-4. Taken together, these findings suggest that ex-4 protects rat BM-MSCs from OGD-induced apoptosis through the activation of the PKA/cAMP pathway and the attenuation of the ER stress signaling pathway. Ex-4 may thus prove to be a therapeutic agent with the potential to improve the viability of MSCs in the ischemic milieu, and consequently, to optimize the therapeutic effects of MSC therapy in acute myocardial infarction."

We report a case of thalamic glioma with H3F3A K27M mutation, which was detected in both the primary tumor diagnosed as diffuse astrocytoma obtained during the first surgery and also in the tumor diagnosed as anaplastic astrocytoma obtained at the second surgery. CASE PRESENTATION: A 14-year-old girl presented with mild headache. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a small intraaxial lesion in the left thalamus, which increased in size. Stereotactic tumor biopsy was performed 2 years after the initial diagnosis, and a pathological diagnosis of diffuse astrocytoma (WHO grade 2) was made. The tumor grew further and showed contrast enhancement on MRI despite 16 months of chemotherapy. Surgical removal via the transcallosal approach was then performed, and postoperative pathological diagnosis was anaplastic astrocytoma (WHO grade 3), indicating malignant transformation of the tumor. Molecular diagnosis of tumor tissue obtained at first and second surgeries revealed H3F3A K27M mutation in both primary and secondary specimens. CONCLUSION: This report demonstrates minute neuroradiological and pathological features of malignant transformation from thalamic low grade glioma with H3F3A K27M mutation. It is noteworthy that this mutation was found in this case when the tumor was still a low-grade glioma. Tissue sampling for genetic analysis is useful in patients with thalamic gliomas to predict the clinical course and efficacy of treatments."

One of them is hepatic capillariasis, caused by the parasite Capillaria hepatica, primarily a disease of rodents, with hepatic manifestations in humans. Although its prevalence is very low, it can cause significant morbidity and mortality, with cases reported from all over the world. The main infective form for humans is the embryonated egg of the parasite, which hatches in the intestine and ultimately colonize the liver. The larvae mature and reproduce, and eventually form embryonated eggs, which cause chronic focal inflammation and septal hepatic fibrosis. Clinical presentation mainly consists of fever, abdominal pain, hepatomegaly and eosinophilia. Spurious infection with unembryonated eggs cause gastrointestinal symptoms. Diagnostic modalities include liver biopsy, ultrasonography, CT scan, immunological tests like ELISA and IIFT. The infection can be treated mainly with a combination of benzimidazoles like thiabendazole, mebendazole and albendazole; with corticosteroids. The study emphasizes the need for hepatic capillariasis to be considered as a differential diagnosis in cases of suspected hepatitis, leptospirosis, abdominal lymphadenopathy or other hepatic or parasitic infections prevalent in the region concerned; and meticulously assess the cases to facilitate early diagnosis and prompt treatment, thus reducing the distress faced by patients."

The related transcription factors TFEB and TFE3 regulate lysosomal activity and autophagy processes known to be important in melanoma. Here we show that MITF binds the CLEAR-box element in the promoters of lysosomal and autophagosomal genes in melanocytes and melanoma cells. The crystal structure of MITF bound to the CLEAR-box reveals how the palindromic nature of this motif induces symmetric MITF homodimer binding. In metastatic melanoma tumors and cell lines, MITF positively correlates with the expression of lysosomal and autophagosomal genes, which, interestingly, are different from the lysosomal and autophagosomal genes correlated with TFEB and TFE3. Depletion of MITF in melanoma cells and melanocytes attenuates the response to starvation-induced autophagy, whereas the overexpression of MITF in melanoma cells increases the number of autophagosomes but is not sufficient to induce autophagic flux. Our results suggest that MITF and the related factors TFEB and TFE3 have separate roles in regulating a starvation-induced autophagy response in melanoma.

We previously showed that curcumin controls reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels through the ROS metabolic enzymes, to prevent tumor cell growth. In this study, we synthesized 39 novel curcumin derivatives and examined their anti-proliferative and anti-tumorigenic properties. METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirty-nine derivatives exhibited anti-proliferative activity toward human cancer cell lines, including CML-derived K562 leukemic cells, in a manner sensitive to an antioxidant, N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC). Some compounds exhibited lower GI50 values than curcumin, some efficiently induced cell senescence, and others markedly increased ROS levels, efficiently induced cell death and suppressed tumor formation in a xenograft mouse model, without any detectable side effects. A clustering analysis of the selected compounds and their measurement variables revealed that anti-tumorigenic activity was most well-correlated with an increase in ROS levels. Pulldown assays and a molecular docking analysis showed that curcumin derivatives competed with co-enzymes to bind to the respective ROS metabolic enzymes and inhibited their enzymatic activities. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis of novel curcumin derivatives established the importance of ROS upregulation in suppression of tumorigenesis, and these compounds are potentially useful for the development of an anti-cancer drug with few side effects."

They increase plasticity and efficacy of mRNA regulation and are recognized by several ARE-specific RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). Typically, AREs are short linear motifs with a high content of complementary A and U nucleotides and often occur in multiple copies. Although thermodynamically rather unstable, the high AU-content might enable transient secondary structure formation and modify mRNA regulation by RBPs. We have recently suggested that the immunoregulatory RBP Roquin recognizes folded AREs as constitutive decay elements (CDEs), resulting in shape-specific ARE-mediated mRNA degradation. However, the structural evidence for a CDE-like recognition of AREs by Roquin is still lacking. We here present structures of CDE-like folded AREs, both in their free and protein-bound form. Moreover, the AREs in the UCP3 3'-UTR are additionally bound by the canonical ARE-binding protein AUF1 in their linear form, adopting an alternative binding-interface compared to the recognition of their CDE structure by Roquin. Strikingly, our findings thus suggest that AREs can be recognized in multiple ways, allowing control over mRNA regulation by adapting distinct conformational states, thus providing differential accessibility to regulatory RBPs."

The long-term morbidity in surviving preterm infants is significantly higher than that in full-term neonates. The causes of sPTB are complex and not fully understood. Human placenta, the maternal and fetal interface, is an environmental core of fetal intrauterine life, mediates fetal oxygen exchange, nutrient uptake, and waste elimination and functions as an immune-defense organ. In this study, the molecular signature of preterm birth placenta was assessed and compared to full-term placenta by proteomic profiling. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four groups of fetal membranes (the amniochorionic membranes), with five cases in each group in the discovery study and 30 cases in each group for validation, were included: groups A: sPTL; B: PPROM; C: full-term birth (FTB); and D: full-term premature rupture of membrane (PROM). Fetal membranes were dissected and used for proteome quantification study. Maxquant and Perseus were used for protein quantitation and statistical analysis. Both fetal membranes and placental villi samples were used to validate proteomic discovery. RESULTS: Proteomics analysis of fetal membranes identified 2,800 proteins across four groups. Sixty-two proteins show statistical differences between the preterm and full-term groups. Among these differentially expressed proteins are (1) proteins involved in inflammation (HPGD), T cell activation (PTPRC), macrophage activation (CAPG, CD14, and CD163), (2) cell adhesion (ICAM and ITGAM), (3) proteolysis (CTSG, ELANE, and MMP9), (4) antioxidant (MPO), (5) extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins (APMAP, COL4A1, LAMA2, LMNB1, LMNB2, FBLN2, and CSRP1) and (6) metabolism of glycolysis (PKM and ADPGK), fatty acid synthesis (ACOX1 and ACSL3), and energy biosynthesis (ATP6AP1 and CYBB). CONCLUSION: Our molecular signature study of preterm fetal membranes revealed inflammation as a major event, which is inconsistent with previous findings. Proteolysis may play an important role in fetal membrane rupture. Extracellular matrix s have been altered in preterm fetal membranes due to proteolysis. Metabolism was also altered in preterm fetal membranes. The molecular changes in the fetal membranes provided a significant molecular signature for PPROM in preterm syndrome."

In SH-SY5Y cells, overexpression of full-length HuD increased SOD1 mRNA and protein levels while a dominant negative form of the RBP downregulated its expression. HuD regulation of SOD1 mRNA was also found to be oxidative stress (OS)-dependent, as shown by the increased HuD binding and upregulation of this mRNA after H2O2 exposure. This treatment also induced a shift in alternative polyadenylation (APA) site usage in SOD1 3'UTR, increasing the levels of a long variant bearing HuD binding sites. The requirement of HuD for SOD1 upregulation during oxidative damage was validated using a specific siRNA that downregulated HuD protein levels to 36% and prevented upregulation of SOD1 and 91 additional genes. In the motor cortex from sALS patients, we found increases in SOD1 and HuD mRNAs and proteins, accompanied by greater HuD binding to this mRNA as confirmed by RNA-immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays. Altogether, our results suggest a role of HuD in the post-transcriptional regulation of SOD1 expression during ALS pathogenesis."

METHODS: Blinded data from the BE RADIANT phase 3b trial of bimekizumab were analysed. In BE RADIANT, patients were randomised 1:1 to bimekizumab 320 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W) or secukinumab 300 mg (weekly until Week 4, then Q4W). Three items (itching, skin pain and scaling) of the P-SIM were electronically assessed throughout the trial and were scored from 0 to 10 (none to very severe signs/symptoms/impacts). Test-retest reliability was determined using intraclass correlations. Convergent validity was assessed between P-SIM and other relevant PRO and clinician-reported outcome (ClinRO) scores. Known-groups validity was assessed by comparing mean P-SIM item scores between patient subgroups based on the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI)/Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) scores. Responsiveness was assessed via correlations between changes from baseline in P-SIM item scores and other relevant PRO and ClinRO scores. Anchor-based responder analyses and empirical cumulative distribution function (eCDF) curves determined responder thresholds. RESULTS: The three P-SIM items yielded high intraclass coefficients (> 0.70). By Week 48, the three P-SIM items had moderate (> 0.30 and <= 0.50) to strong (> 0.50) correlations with other PROs and weaker correlations with ClinROs, demonstrating good convergent validity. For almost all known-group comparisons, statistically significant between-subgroup score differences were seen across all three P-SIM items. Changes from baseline in the P-SIM and other relevant outcomes were above the acceptable threshold of <= 0.30, demonstrating sensitivity to change. Anchor-based analyses determined a >= four-point reduction from baseline to indicate marked clinically meaningful improvement for the P-SIM. CONCLUSION: These results support the validity, reliability and sensitivity to change of the P-SIM in assessing key symptoms (itching, skin pain and scaling) in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.

Several reports revealed that CAG repeats in some polyQ-containing genes may affect the age at onset (AAO) of patients with SCA2, however, little studies were conducted among Chinese patients with SCA2. Thus, the aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of CAG repeats on the AAO of patients with SCA2 in China. METHODS: A total of 119 patients with SCA2 were enrolled and were divided into 2 groups according to their major phenotype: 17 patients from 9 families with Parkinson's syndrome were grouped as the Parkinson's disease-SCA2 (PD-SAC2); 91 patients from 66 SCA2 families and 11 sporadic SCA2 patients were grouped as the ataxia-SCA2 (A-SCA2). Blood samples were obtained from the subjects, and the CAG repeat length in ATXN2 and other (CAG)n-containing genes was screened using fluorescent PCR. The Spearman's rank correlation between the CAG repeat length in (CAG)n-containing genes and AAO was analyzed. Regression analysis was performed to investigate whether the CAG repeat length could explain the variant of AAO. A t-test was used to compare the difference of CAG repeat length in (CAG)n-containing genes between the PD-SAC2 and A-SCA2 groups. RESULTS: The CAG repeat length in the longer allele of ATXN2 was negatively correlated with AAO of SCA2 (R=-0.251, P<0.05), and the CAG repeat length could explain 41.7% of the variation of AAO. AAO negatively correlated with the CAG repeat length in the shorter allele of ATXN7 (R=-0.251, P=0.006) or in the longer allele of TBP gene (R=-0.197, P=0.034). A tendency of delay in the AAO was also observed in patients with SCA2 carrying the CAG repeat within the ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, TBP, and RAI1. In addition, we found that the CAG repeat length in ATXN7 and ATXN2 between the A-SCA2 and the PD-SCA2 groups was significantly different (both P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The CAG repeat in ATXN2 is a major genetic factor for the AAO of patients with SCA2 in China. The CAG repeat length in ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, TBP, and RAI1 genes might be a potential factor associated with the AAO of SCA2. The CAG repeat in ATXN7 might be a potential factor affecting the Parkinson's syndrome in SCA2."

We assessed the safety and immunogenicity of heterologous immunization with a recombinant adenovirus type-5-vectored Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine (Convidecia, hereafter referred to as CV) and a protein-subunit-based COVID-19 vaccine (ZF2001, hereafter referred to as ZF). METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled trial, in which healthy adults aged 18 years or older, who have received 1 dose of Convidecia, with no history of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, were recruited in Jiangsu, China. Sixty participants were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive either 1 dose of ZF2001 or placebo control (trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV)) administered at 28 days after priming, and received the third injection with ZF2001 at 5 months, referred to as CV/ZF/ZF (D0-D28-M5) and CV/ZF (D0-M5) regimen, respectively. Sixty participants were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive either 1 dose of ZF2001 or TIV administered at 56 days after priming, and received the third injection with ZF2001 at 6 months, referred to as CV/ZF/ZF (D0-D56-M6) and CV/ZF (D0-M6) regimen, respectively. Participants and investigators were masked to the vaccine received but not to the boosting interval. Primary endpoints were the geometric mean titer (GMT) of neutralizing antibodies against wild-type SARS-CoV-2 and 7-day solicited adverse reactions. The primary analysis was done in the intention-to-treat population. Between April 7, 2021 and May 6, 2021, 120 eligible participants were randomly assigned to receive ZF2001/ZF2001 (n = 40) or TIV/ZF2001 (n = 20) 28 days and 5 months post priming, and receive ZF2001/ZF2001 (n = 40) or TIV/ZF2001 (n = 20) 56 days and 6 months post priming. Of them, 7 participants did not receive the third injection with ZF2001. A total of 26 participants (21.7%) reported solicited adverse reactions within 7 days post boost vaccinations, and all the reported adverse reactions were mild, with 13 (32.5%) in CV/ZF/ZF (D0-D28-M5) regimen, 7 (35.0%) in CV/ZF (D0- M5) regimen, 4 (10.0%) in CV/ZF/ZF (D0-D56-M6) regimen, and 2 (10.0%) in CV/ZF (D0-M6) regimen, respectively. At 14 days post first boost, GMTs of neutralizing antibodies in recipients receiving ZF2001 at 28 days and 56 days post priming were 18.7 (95% CI 13.7 to 25.5) and 25.9 (17.0 to 39.3), respectively, with geometric mean ratios of 2.0 (1.2 to 3.5) and 3.4 (1.8 to 6.4) compared to TIV. GMTs at 14 days after second boost of neutralizing antibodies increased to 107.2 (73.7 to 155.8) in CV/ZF/ZF (D0-D28-M5) regimen and 141.2 (83.4 to 238.8) in CV/ZF/ZF (D0-D56-M6) regimen. Two-dose schedules of CV/ZF (D0-M5) and CV/ZF (D0-M6) induced antibody levels comparable with that elicited by 3-dose schedules, with GMTs of 90.5 (45.6, 179.8) and 94.1 (44.0, 200.9), respectively. Study limitations include the absence of vaccine effectiveness in a real-world setting and current lack of immune persistence data. CONCLUSIONS: Heterologous boosting with ZF2001 following primary vaccination with Convidecia is more immunogenic than a single dose of Convidecia and is not associated with safety concerns. These results support flexibility in cooperating viral vectored and recombinant protein vaccines.

Infections can result from inhalation of spores into the nares, oropharynx or lungs, ingestion of contaminated food or water, or inoculation into disrupted skin or wounds. In developed countries, MCR occurs primarily in severely immunocompromised hosts. In contrast, in developing/low income countries, most cases of MCR occur in persons with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus and some cases in immunocompetent subjects following trauma. Mucormycosis exhibits a propensity to invade blood vessels, leading to thrombosis and infarction of tissue. Mortality rates associated with invasive MCR are high and can exceed 90% with disseminated disease. Mucormycosis can be classified as one of six forms: (1) rhino-orbital-cerebral mucormycosis (ROCM); (2) pulmonary; (3) cutaneous; (4) gastrointestinal or renal (5); disseminated; (6) uncommon (focal) sites. AREAS COVERED: The authors discuss the prevalence, risk factors and clinical features of mucormycosis.A literature search of mucormycosis was performed via PubMed (up to November 2022), using the key words: invasive fungal infections; mold; mucormycosis; Mucorales; Zyzomyces; Zygomycosis; Rhizopus, diagnosis. EXPERT OPINION: Mucormycosis occurs primarily in severely immunocompromised hosts. Mucormycosis can progress rapidly, and delay in initiating treatment by even a few days worsens outcomes."

The discussion considers the diagnostic interest of psammoma bodies in central nervous system tumors, as well as its histogenesis. The different points of view explaining biological mineralization in other territories of the organism are analyzed, as well as the formation of psammoma bodies, comparing the morphologic data obtained in this study. It is concluded that the mineralization of the psammoma bodies is induced principally by the collagen fibers synthesized by the meningocytes and that the form of mineralization is spherical and growth is radial, controlled by the tumoral cells."

Treatment of the cell-free fraction with DNase reduced the total synthesis of RNA considerably, but it did not influence that of the ASBV-specific RNAs, indicating that the latter were transcribed on an RNA template. Inhibition studies with alpha-amanitin showed that the synthesis of ASBV-specific RNAs was not affected by concentrations of 1 and 200 micrograms/ml of the drug, which typically inhibit RNA polymerase II and III, respectively, from most animal and plant systems. These results suggest that either RNA polymerase I or an unidentified RNA polymerase activity resistant to alpha-amanitin, acting on an RNA template, plays a role in the replication of ASBV, whereas for the rest of the viroids studied so far it appears that RNA polymerase II is involved. Analysis by polycrylamide gel electrophoresis under partially and fully denaturing conditions of the ASBV-specific RNAs synthesized in vitro showed that they contain unit and longer than unit length viroid strands, probably associated in complexes with single- and double-stranded regions. The structural properties of these complexes are similar to those of the RNAs accumulating in vivo in viroid-infected tissues, which are the postulated replicative intermediates of the rolling-circle mechanism proposed for viroid synthesis."

The symptoms of subdural empyema may be mild and may be the same as those associated with sinusitis, or the infection may result in alteration of the level of consciousness and focal neurologic deficits. Rapid recognition and treatment of subdural empyema is extremely important. Before magnetic resonance imaging became available, computed tomography was used for rapid diagnosis of this infection. Magnetic resonance imaging, however, is now becoming the diagnostic tool of choice. Neurosurgical intervention and high doses of intravenously administered antibiotics are the mainstays of treatment.

Recent studies have also demonstrated that thalidomide has antineoplastic activity via an antiangiogenic mechanism. Observations in the late 1990s that the microenvironment in the bone marrow plays a role in tumor progression in multiple myeloma provided an impetus to use thalidomide for the treatment of this disease. It is known that thalidomide monotherapy is effective in one-third of refractory cases, and in combination with glucocorticoids and/or antineoplastic drugs, thalidomide provides a response rate of more than 50%. Thus, thalidomide therapy is considered a standard approach for the treatment of relapsed and refractory myeloma. The exact mechanism of the antimyeloma effect of thalidomide is not yet clearly understood. Anti-angiogenic effects, direct activity in tumor cells such as the induction of apoptosis or G1 arrest of the cell cycle, the inhibition of growth factor production, the regulation of interactions between tumor and stromal cells, and the modulation of tumor immunity have been considered as possible mechanisms. In addition to its teratogenicity, the adverse effects of thalidomide have been general symptoms such as somnolence and headache, peripheral neuropathy, constipation, skin rash, and other symptoms. Although these adverse effects are generally reversible and mild, grade 3 and 4 toxicities such as peripheral neuropathy, deep venous thrombosis, neutropenia, and toxic dermal necrosis have occasionally been reported. The application of thalidomide therapy in patients with multiple myeloma is being broadened to include not only cases of refractory myeloma, but also previously untreated cases, as well as for maintenance therapy after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and for the treatment of other hematological diseases. The safe use of this drug will depend on the establishment of diagnostic and treatment guidelines. In addition, the establishment of a nation-wide regulation system is urgently needed in Japan."

FAAP95 replaces BRCA2 as the true FANCB protein.\nFanconi anemia (FA) proteins function in a DNA damage response pathway that appears to be part of the network including breast cancer susceptibility gene products, BRCA1 and BRCA2. In response to DNA damage or replication signals, a nuclear FA core complex of at least 6 FA proteins (FANCA, FANCC, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG and FANCL) is activated and leads to monoubiquitination of the downstream FA protein, FANCD2. One puzzling question for this pathway is the role of BRCA2. A previous study has proposed that BRCA2 could be identical to two FA proteins: FANCD1, which functions either downstream or in a parallel pathway; and FANCB, which functions upstream of the FANCD2 monoubiquitination. Now, a new study shows that the real FANCB protein is not BRCA2, but a previously uncharacterized component of the FA core complex, FAAP95, suggesting that BRCA2 does not act upstream of the FA pathway. Interestingly, the newly discovered FANCB gene is X-linked and subject to X-inactivation. The presence of a single active copy of FANCB and its essentiality for a functional FA-BRCA pathway make it a potentially vulnerable component of the cellular machinery that maintains genomic integrity."

In experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a disease induced in animals by immunization with proteins or peptides from the CNS, the animals develop symptoms similar to multiple sclerosis (MS). The increased levels of citrullinated CNS proteins associated with MS are also observed during the development of EAE. To study the role of CNS protein citrullination in EAE development, we induced EAE with a peptide derived from myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG(35-55)) in mice lacking the peptidylarginine deiminase 2 (PAD2) protein, because this enzyme was the most likely candidate to be involved in catalyzing CNS protein citrullination in the diseased state. Even though the PAD2 knockout mice displayed a dramatic reduction in the amount of citrullination present in the CNS, indicating that PAD2 is indeed responsible for the majority of detectable citrullination observed in EAE, the development of EAE was not impaired by genetic deletion of PAD2, suggesting that PAD2 catalyzed citrullination is not essential to the development of EAE."

The cellular location and functional diversity of beta-barrel outer membrane proteins (omps) makes them an important protein class. At the present time, very few nonhomologous TMB structures have been determined by X-ray diffraction because of the experimental difficulty encountered in crystallizing transmembrane proteins. A novel method using pairwise interstrand residue statistical potentials derived from globular (nonouter membrane) proteins is introduced to predict the supersecondary structure of transmembrane beta-barrel proteins. The algorithm transFold employs a generalized hidden Markov model (i.e., multitape S-attribute grammar) to describe potential beta-barrel supersecondary structures and then computes by dynamic programming the minimum free energy beta-barrel structure. Hence, the approach can be viewed as a \"wrapping\" component that may capture folding processes with an initiation stage followed by progressive interaction of the sequence with the already-formed motifs. This approach differs significantly from others, which use traditional machine learning to solve this problem, because it does not require a training phase on known TMB structures and is the first to explicitly capture and predict long-range interactions. TransFold outperforms previous programs for predicting TMBs on smaller (<or=200 residues) proteins and matches their performance for straightforward recognition of longer proteins. An exception is for multimeric porins where the algorithm does perform well when an important functional motif in loops is initially identified. We verify our simulations of the folding process by comparing them with experimental data on the functional folding of TMBs. A Web server running transFold is available and outputs contact predictions and locations for sequences predicted to form TMBs."

Both T4 and DITPA treatment reduced chamber diameter during diastole, suggesting attenuated chamber dilatation in cardiomyopathic hamsters. Wall thickness also tended to increase, which was supported by cell morphology data in which DITPA significantly increased cross-sectional growth of myocytes specifically in the minor dimension, which is oriented transmurally. T4 and DITPA also increased myocardial blood flow both at baseline and after maximal dilation. This suggests there was increased angiogenesis or reduced loss of arterioles. Both T4 and DITPA had beneficial effects on chamber remodeling, which was most likely due to beneficial changes in cell shape and improved vascular supply."

Most previous work on this gene has been focused on its role in development. A role in carcinogenesis has emerged recently, but the mechanism is unclear. We classified melanoma cells into MiTF-positive and -negative groups and explored the function of MiTF in regulating cellular responses to reactive oxygen species (ROS). The MiTF-positive melanoma cell lines accumulated high levels of apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease (APE-1/Ref-1, redox effector-1), a key redox sensor and DNA endonuclease critical for oxidative DNA damage repair. We demonstrate that APE-1 is a transcriptional target for MiTF. Knocking down MiTF led to reduced APE-1 protein accumulation, as well as abolished induction of APE-1 by ROS. MiTF-negative melanoma cells survived more poorly under ROS stress than the MiTF-positive cells based on 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay and Trypan blue staining. Overexpression of APE-1 partially rescued ROS-induced cell death when MiTF was depleted. We conclude that MiTF regulates cellular response to ROS by regulation of APE-1, and this may provide a mechanism of how MiTF is involved in melanoma carcinogenesis."

At the cellular level, PARP1 has been implicated in a wide range of processes, such as maintenance of genome stability, cell death, and transcription. PARP1 functions as a transcriptional coactivator of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) and hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF1). In proteomic studies, PARP1 was found to be modified by small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMOs). Here, we characterize PARP1 as a substrate for modification by SUMO1 and SUMO3, both in vitro and in vivo. PARP1 is sumoylated at the single lysine residue K486 within its automodification domain. Interestingly, modification of PARP1 with SUMO does not affect its ADP-ribosylation activity but completely abrogates p300-mediated acetylation of PARP1, revealing an intriguing crosstalk of sumoylation and acetylation on PARP1. Genetic complementation of PARP1-depleted cells with wild-type and sumoylation-deficient PARP1 revealed that SUMO modification of PARP1 restrains its transcriptional coactivator function and subsequently reduces gene expression of distinct PARP1-regulated target genes."

Enzymatic citrullination abolishes positive charges of native protein molecules, inevitably causing significant alterations in their structure and functions. Among the five isoforms of PADs, PAD2 and PAD4 are proved occupants of the central nervous system (CNS), and especially PAD2 is a main PAD enzyme expressed in the CNS. We previously reported that abnormal protein citrullination by PAD2 has been closely associated with the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and prion disease. Protein citrullination in these patients is thought to play a role during the initiation and/or progression of disease. However, the contribution of changes in PAD2 levels, and consequent citrullination, during developmental and aging processes remained unclear. Therefore, we used quantitative real-time RT-PCR, Western blot analysis, and immunohistochemical methods to measure PAD2 expression and localization in the brain during those processes. PAD2 mRNA expression was detected in the brains of mice as early as embryonic day 15, and its expression in cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum increased significantly as the animals aged from 3 to 30 months old. No citrullinated proteins were detected during that period. Moreover, we found here, for the first time, that PAD2 localized specifically in the neuronal cells of the cerebral cortex and Purkinje cells of the cerebellum. These findings indicate that, despite PAD2's normally inactive status, it becomes active and citrullinates cellular proteins, but only when the intracellular Ca(2+) balance is upset during neurodegenerative changes."

The corresponding blots were probed with sera from RA (n = 30) and disease control samples (n = 30). Protein spots showing a sensitivity of >15% were identified by MS. 1-D immunoblots revealed one protein band with a specificity in RA of 100%, a sensitivity of 43%, which was identified as fibrinogen beta chain. 2-D analysis revealed the subunits of fibrinogen, especially the beta and gamma chain, as the most prominent synovial autoantigens. We also identified vimentin, the Sa-antigen and carbonic anhydrase I as a potentially new synovial autoantigen. The protein patterns of these immunoreactive spots were observed as trains. The spots showing the highest autoimmune reactivity occurred at the acidic side of these trains and were recognized by anticitrullinated protein/peptide antibodies positive RA sera. Antimodified citrulline staining of these patterns confirmed protein citrullination. Therefore, PTMs such as citrullination due to alterations of peptidylarginine deiminase activity or generation of RA-specific epitopes, should be considered as a trigger in tolerance break."

The diagnosis of dementia, along with the prediction of who will develop dementia, has been assisted by magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography (PET) by using [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). These techniques, however, are not specific for AD. Based on the chemistry of histologic staining dyes, several Abeta-specific positron-emitting radiotracers have been developed to image neuropathology of AD. Among these, [(11)C]PiB is the most studied Abeta-binding PET radiopharmaceutical in the world. The histologic and biochemical specificity of PiB binding across different regions of the AD brain was demonstrated by showing a direct correlation between Abeta-containing amyloid plaques and in vivo [(11)C]PiB retention measured by PET imaging. Because (11)C is not ideal for commercialization, several (18)F-labeled tracers have been developed. At this time, [(18)F]3'-F-PiB (Flutemetamol), (18)F-AV-45 (Florbetapir), and (18)F-AV-1 (Florbetaben) are undergoing extensive phase II and III clinical trials. This article provides a brief review of the amyloid biology and chemistry of Abeta-specific (11)C and (18)F-PET radiopharmaceuticals. Clinical trials have clearly documented that PET radiopharmaceuticals capable of assessing Abeta content in vivo in the brains of AD subjects and subjects with mild cognitive impairment will be important as diagnostic agents to detect in vivo amyloid brain pathology. In addition, PET amyloid imaging will also help test the amyloid cascade hypothesis of AD and as an aid to assess the efficacy of antiamyloid therapeutics currently under development in clinical trials."

However, whether patients with various pathological sellar tumors have risk for osteopenia remains unclear. The aim of the present study is to assess the bone mass alteration in patients with various sellar tumors and further to investigate the risk factors of bone mass alteration. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 65 premenopausal female patients with diverse sellar tumors and 325 normal controls were enrolled in this study. Bone mineral density (BMD) of lumbar spine and comprehensive endocrinological evaluations were undergone. RESULTS: Compared to the matched controls, BMD of patients with prolactinoma or craniopharyngioma significantly decreased. Patients with sellar meningioma and nonfunctioning adenoma are with a decreasing tendency and patients with growth hormone-secreting adenoma are with an increasing tendency compared to controls. Univariate and multivariate regression analysis indicated that the bone loss in prolactinomas was significantly correlated to disease duration and hypogonadism. CONCLUSION: In the premenopausal women, patients with prolactinoma or craniopharyngioma are often accompanied with osteopenia or osteoporosis, and disease duration and hypogonadism are the risk factors of bone loss in prolactinoma. Continuous surveillance of BMD is recommended in patients with meningioma or nonfunctioning adenoma."

Here we report that mice lacking the essential mTORC2 component rictor in liver (Lrictor(KO)) are unable to respond normally to insulin. In response to insulin, Lrictor(KO) mice failed to inhibit hepatic glucose output. Lrictor(KO) mice also fail to develop hepatic steatosis on a high fat diet and manifest half-normal serum cholesterol levels. This is accompanied by lower levels of expression of SREBP-1c and SREBP-2 and genes of fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis. Lrictor(KO) mice had defects in insulin-stimulated Akt Ser-473 and Thr-308 phosphorylation, leading to decreased phosphorylation of Akt substrates FoxO, GSK-3beta, PRAS40, AS160, and Tsc2. Lrictor(KO) mice also manifest defects in insulin-activated mTORC1 activity, evidenced by decreased S6 kinase and Lipin1 phosphorylation. Glucose intolerance and insulin resistance of Lrictor(KO) mice could be fully rescued by hepatic expression of activated Akt2 or dominant negative FoxO1. However, in the absence of mTORC2, forced Akt2 activation was unable to drive hepatic lipogenesis. Thus, we have identified an Akt-independent relay from mTORC2 to hepatic lipogenesis that separates the effects of insulin on glucose and lipid metabolism."

In addition, emergency physicians are often faced with patients who present first to the ED with conditions that may prompt long-term anticoagulation upon hospital discharge, such as atrial fibrillation (AF), or who have acute or potential bleeding complications from anticoagulation. OBJECTIVE: In this review, clinical trials of new oral anticoagulants evaluated for treatment of VTE and stroke prophylaxis in AF, as well as practical management aspects, will be discussed. In addition, clinical trials evaluating the adjunctive use of the new oral anticoagulants with antiplatelet therapy in patients who have experienced acute coronary syndrome will be explored. DISCUSSION: Both dabigatran etexilate and rivaroxaban have successfully completed phase III trials for acute VTE treatment and are currently approved for the reduction of risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular AF. In a recently completed phase III trial, apixaban also demonstrated promising efficacy and safety in that indication. Rivaroxaban represents the only new anticoagulant to date to have shown promising phase III results as an adjunct to antiplatelet therapy after acute coronary syndrome. CONCLUSION: Knowledge of the appropriate clinical use and safety concerns of the new anticoagulants is imperative as they become more frequently prescribed, and their potential uses in the ED setting represent an important aspect of continuing education for emergency physicians."

In the past, controversial findings have been presented for the role of the C-terminal regulatory domain (RD) of p53 as both a negative regulator and a positive regulator of p53 activity. However, the underlying mechanism remained enigmatic. To understand the function of the RD and of a dominant phosphorylation site within the RD, we analyzed p53 variants in vivo and in vitro. Our experiments revealed, surprisingly, that the p53 RD of one subunit interacts with the DNA binding domain of an adjacent subunit in the tetramer. This leads to the formation of intersubunit contacts that stabilize the tetrameric state of p53 and enhance its transcriptional activity in a cooperative manner. These effects are further modulated by phosphorylation of a conserved serine within the RD."

Having a single TFBS model for a TF is more pragmatic for practical applications.

To construct position weight matrices to represent these TFBS models, we used ChIPMunk software in four computational modes, including newly developed periodic positional prior mode associated with DNA helix pitch. We selected only one TFBS model per TF, unless there was a clear experimental evidence for two rather distinct TFBS models. We assigned a quality rating to each model.

Activation of apoptotic pathways or the removal of cellular apoptotic inhibitors has been suggested to aid cancer therapy and the inhibition of apoptosis was thought to limit ischaemia-induced damage. However, initial clinical studies on apoptosis-modulating drugs led to unexpected results in different clinical conditions and this may have been due to co-effects on non-apoptotic interconnected cell death mechanisms and the 'yin-yang' role of autophagy in survival versus cell death. In this review, we extend the analysis of cell death beyond apoptosis. Upon introduction of molecular pathways governing autophagy and necrosis (also called necroptosis or programmed necrosis), we focus on the interconnected character of cell death signals and on the shared cell death processes involving mitochondria (e.g. mitophagy and mitoptosis) and molecular signals playing prominent roles in multiple pathways (e.g. Bcl2-family members and p53). We also briefly highlight stress-induced cell senescence that plays a role not only in organismal ageing but also offers the development of novel anticancer strategies. Finally, we briefly illustrate the interconnected character of cell death forms in clinical settings while discussing irradiation-induced mitotic catastrophe. The signalling pathways are discussed in their relation to cancer biology and treatment approaches."

Some of the alterations taking place in breast cancer cells are currently exploited by molecularly targeted drugs. Different drugs have been developed which target a single molecule but, given that the tumor originates from the dysregulation of many genes, there is the need to find new drugs that have more than one molecular target. Curcumin [1,7-bis-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-1,6-heptadiene-3,5-dione] (CUR), a polyphenolic compound found in the spice turmeric, is a pleiotropic molecule able to interact with a variety of molecular targets and has antitumor, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, immunomodulatory and antimicrobial activities. Here we demonstrate that CUR inhibits the growth of breast cancer cell lines in a dose dependent manner, with IC50 values in the micromolar range, and induces an increase in the percentage of cells in sub-G0 phase, representing the apoptotic cell population. The activation of apoptosis was confirmed by PARP-1 cleavage and by the increased ratio between the pro-apoptotic Bax and the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein. In addition, in CUR-treated cells the activity of ERK1/ERK2 MAP kinases was down-regulated. The cytotoxic effects of CUR were observed in breast cancer cells expressing either high or low levels of ErbB2/neu. The in vivo antitumor activity of CUR was tested in BALB-neuT mice transgenic for the neu oncogene, which develop atypical hyperplasia of the mammary gland at 6 weeks of age and invasive carcinoma at 16 weeks of age. CUR, administered to mice both early and in an advanced stage of mammary carcinogenesis, induced a significant prolongation of tumor-free survival and a reduction of tumor multiplicity. In addition, CUR administration was safe, since no modification of hematological and clinical chemistry parameters could be observed in BALB-neuT and BALB/c mice treated with this compound for several weeks. These findings support further studies on the therapeutic potential of CUR in combination with standard therapies in breast cancer patients."

We recently observed that exon-intron architectures can be grouped into two classes: one with higher GC content in exons compared to the flanking introns, and the other with similar GC content in exons and introns. The first group has higher nucleosome occupancy on exons than introns, whereas the second group exhibits weak nucleosome marking of exons, suggesting another type of epigenetic marker distinguishes exons from introns when GC content is similar. We find different and specific patterns of DNA methylation in each of the GC architectures; yet in both groups, DNA methylation clearly marks the exons. Exons of the leveled GC architecture exhibit a significantly stronger DNA methylation signal in relation to their flanking introns compared to exons of the differential GC architecture. This is accentuated by a reduction of the DNA methylation level in the intronic sequences in proximity to the splice sites and shows that different epigenetic modifications mark the location of exons already at the DNA level. Also, lower levels of methylated CpGs on alternative exons can successfully distinguish alternative exons from constitutive ones. Three positions at the splice sites show high CpG abundance and accompany elevated nucleosome occupancy in a leveled GC architecture. Overall, these results suggest that DNA methylation affects exon recognition and is influenced by the GC architecture of the exon and flanking introns."

In particular, the B-cell receptor (BCR) and nuclear factor- kappaB (NF-kappaB) pathways are activated in the lymph node (LN) microenvironment. Thus, model systems mimicking tumor-host interactions are important tools to study CLL biology and pathogenesis. We investigated whether the recently established NOD/scid/gammac(null) (NSG) mouse xenograft model can recapitulate the effects of the human microenvironment. We assessed, therefore, tumor characteristics previously defined in LN-resident CLL cells, including proliferation, and activation of the BCR and NF-kappaB pathways. We found that the murine spleen (SP) microenvironment supported CLL cell proliferation and activation to a similar degree than the human LN, including induction of BCR and NF-kappaB signaling in the xenografted cells. Next, we used this model to study ibrutinib, a Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor in clinical development. Ibrutinib inhibited BCR and NF-kappaB signaling induced by the microenvironment, decreased proliferation, induced apoptosis and reduced the tumor burden in vivo. Thus, our data demonstrate that the SP of xenografted NSG mice can, in part, recapitulate the role of the human LN for CLL cells. In addition, we show that ibrutinib effectively disrupts tumor-host interactions essential for CLL cell proliferation and survival in vivo. "

The Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) recently proposed an equation to estimate GFR in subjects without cirrhosis using both serum creatinine and cystatin C levels. Performance of the new CKD-EPI creatinine-cystatin C equation (2012) was superior to previous creatinine- or cystatin C-based GFR equations. To evaluate the performance of the CKD-EPI creatinine-cystatin C equation in subjects with cirrhosis, we compared it to GFR measured by nonradiolabeled iothalamate plasma clearance (mGFR) in 72 subjects with cirrhosis. We compared the \"bias,\" \"precision,\" and \"accuracy\" of the new CKD-EPI creatinine-cystatin C equation to that of 24-hour urinary creatinine clearance (CrCl), Cockcroft-Gault (CG), and previously reported creatinine- and/or cystatin C-based GFR-estimating equations. Accuracy of CKD-EPI creatinine-cystatin C equation as quantified by root mean squared error of difference scores (differences between mGFR and estimated GFR [eGFR] or between mGFR and CrCl, or between mGFR and CG equation for each subject) (RMSE = 23.56) was significantly better than that of CrCl (37.69, P = 0.001), CG (RMSE = 36.12, P = 0.002), and GFR-estimating equations based on cystatin C only. Its accuracy as quantified by percentage of eGFRs that differed by greater than 30% with respect to mGFR was significantly better compared to CrCl (P = 0.024), CG (P = 0.0001), 4-variable MDRD (P = 0.027), and CKD-EPI creatinine 2009 (P = 0.012) equations. However, for 23.61% of the subjects, GFR estimated by CKD-EPI creatinine-cystatin C equation differed from the mGFR by more than 30%.

Amiodarone is a noncompetitive inhibitor of the alpha - and beta -adrenergic receptors and prevents calcium influx in the slow-response cells of the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes. Overexpression of Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) in transgenic mice results in heart failure and arrhythmias. We hypothesised that administration of WXKL and amiodarone can reduce the incidence of arrhythmias by regulating CaMKII signal transduction. A total of 100 healthy Sprague Dawley rats were used in the study. The rats were randomly divided into four groups (a sham group, a myocardial infarction (MI) group, a WXKL-treated group, and an amiodarone-treated group). A myocardial infarction model was established in these rats by ligating the left anterior descending coronary artery for 4 weeks. Western blotting was used to assess CaMKII, p-CaMKII (Thr-286), PLB, p-PLB (Thr-17), RYR2, and FK binding protein 12.6 (FKBP12.6) levels. The Ca(2+) content in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and the calcium transient amplitude were studied by confocal imaging using the fluorescent indicator Fura-4.

Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), an essential component of B-cell-receptor signaling, mediates interactions with the tumor microenvironment and promotes the survival and proliferation of CLL cells. METHODS: We conducted a phase 1b-2 multicenter study to assess the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of ibrutinib (PCI-32765), a first-in-class, oral covalent inhibitor of BTK designed for treatment of B-cell cancers, in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma. A total of 85 patients, the majority of whom were considered to have high-risk disease, received ibrutinib orally once daily; 51 received 420 mg, and 34 received 840 mg. RESULTS: Toxic effects were predominantly grade 1 or 2 and included transient diarrhea, fatigue, and upper respiratory tract infection; thus, patients could receive extended treatment with minimal hematologic toxic effects. The overall response rate was the same in the group that received 420 mg and the group that received 840 mg (71%), and an additional 20% and 15% of patients in the respective groups had a partial response with lymphocytosis. The response was independent of clinical and genomic risk factors present before treatment, including advanced-stage disease, the number of previous therapies, and the 17p13.1 deletion. At 26 months, the estimated progression-free survival rate was 75% and the rate of overall survival was 83%.

However, the role that Sox10 plays in postnatal melanocytes is not established. We show in vivo that melanocyte stem cells (McSCs) and more differentiated melanocytes express SOX10 but that McSCs remain undifferentiated. Sox10 knockout (Sox10(fl); Tg(Tyr::CreER)) results in loss of both McSCs and differentiated melanocytes, while overexpression of Sox10 (Tg(DctSox10)) causes premature differentiation and loss of McSCs, leading to hair graying. This suggests that levels of SOX10 are key to normal McSC function and Sox10 must be downregulated for McSC establishment and maintenance. We examined whether the mechanism of Tg(DctSox10) hair graying is through increased expression of Mitf, a target of SOX10, by asking if haploinsufficiency for Mitf (Mitf(vga9) ) can rescue hair graying in Tg(DctSox10) animals. Surprisingly, Mitf(vga9) does not mitigate but exacerbates Tg(DctSox10) hair graying suggesting that MITF participates in the negative regulation of Sox10 in McSCs. These observations demonstrate that while SOX10 is necessary to maintain the postnatal melanocyte lineage it is simultaneously prevented from driving differentiation in the McSCs. This data illustrates how tissue-specific stem cells can arise from lineage-specified precursors through the regulation of the very transcription factors important in defining that lineage."

The Hesx1-expression domain of the ANP is underlain by Dkk1-expressing tissues, initially proximal-most anterior visceral endoderm (AVE), and later anterior mesendoderm (AME). As Dkk1-null embryos fail to develop the Hesx1-expressing domain, it is likely that Wnt signal inhibition in the ANP is required for the Hesx1 activation. To investigate the regulation of the AFBP development, we took advantage of epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs), which develop into the ANP in the absence of activin signaling. Expression of Hesx1 and Six3, both involved in the AFBP development, was strongly activated 2 days after activin removal and concomitant addition of Wnt signal inhibitors, Dkk1 or XAV939. Furthermore, we showed that activation of the 720-bp Hesx1 5' enhancer is responsible for Hesx1 expression in the AFBP and depends on Wnt signal inhibition. In addition, we showed that Wnt inhibition during the first day has larger impact on the activation of Hesx1 and Six3 than the second day, suggesting that in embryos Wnt inhibition caused by the AVE-derived Dkk1, rather than the AME-derived Dkk1, contributes greatly in the establishment of the AFBP.

        "text": "Higher potency statins and the risk of new diabetes: multicentre, observational study of administrative databases.\nOBJECTIVE: To evaluate the incremental increase in new onset diabetes from higher potency statins compared with lower potency statins when used for secondary prevention. DESIGN: Eight population based cohort studies and a meta-analysis. SETTING: Six Canadian provinces and two international databases from the UK and US. PARTICIPANTS: 136,966 patients aged >= 40 years newly treated with statins between 1 January 1997 and 31 March 2011. METHODS: Within each cohort of patients newly prescribed a statin after hospitalisation for a major cardiovascular event or procedure, we performed as-treated, nested case-control analyses to compare diabetes incidence in users of higher potency statins with incidence in users of lower potency statins. Rate ratios of new diabetes events were estimated using conditional logistic regression on different lengths of exposure to higher potency versus lower potency statins; adjustment for confounding was achieved using high dimensional propensity scores. Meta-analytic methods were used to estimate overall effects across sites. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Hospitalisation for new onset diabetes, or a prescription for insulin or an oral antidiabetic drug. RESULTS: In the first two years of regular statin use, we observed a significant increase in the risk of new onset diabetes with higher potency statins compared with lower potency agents (rate ratio 1.15, 95% confidence interval 1.05 to 1.26). The risk increase seemed to be highest in the first four months of use (rate ratio 1.26, 1.07 to 1.47). CONCLUSIONS: Higher potency statin use is associated with a moderate increase in the risk of new onset diabetes compared with lower potency statins in patients treated for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Clinicians should consider this risk when prescribing higher potency statins in secondary prevention patients."

Epidemiologic studies in humans and research in rodents have suggested that hypothyroidism could participate in the etiology of AD. Recently, we reported that adult-onset hypothyroidism in rats favors beta-amyloid peptide production in the hippocampus. Here, using the same hypothyroidism model with the antithyroid molecule propythiouracyl (PTU), we further explored AD-related features, dysfunctional cell-signaling mechanisms and hippocampal-dependent learning and memory. In vivo MRI revealed a progressive decrease in cerebral volume of PTU-treated rats. In the hippocampus, hypothyroidism resulted in tau hyperphosphorylation and increases in several proinflammatory cytokines. These modifications were associated with impaired spatial memory and reduced hippocampal expression of signaling molecules important for synaptic plasticity and memory, including neurogranin, CaMKII, ERK, GSK3beta, CREB, and expression of the transcription factor EGR1/Zif268. These data strengthen the idea that hypothyroidism represents an important factor influencing the risk of developing sporadic forms of AD."

The disease is diagnosed by radiological findings of giant bullae in one, or both, of the upper lobes of the lung, occupying at least one-third of the hemithorax. There have been several reports of vanishing lung syndrome, however it remains to be determined whether genetic inheritance is associated with the disease. In the present study, five patients within one family, with vanishing lung syndrome, were reported during a follow-up period of ~ 20 years. All of the patients were diagnosed by radiological findings, which showed diffuse bullae in the lungs, which were of varying size and asymmetrical distribution, and the occurrence of pneumothorax or emphysema. The Medical Ethics Committee of the People's Hospital of Zhangye Municipality (Zhangye, China) approved this study, and all subjects gave their informed consent During the follow-up period of 20 years, bullae in these patients were shown to progressively increase, and no other pulmonary diseases, including lung cancer, tuberculosis, pneumoconiosis and chronic bronchitis were observed. Autosomal dominant inheritance was observed in five cases, and autosomal recessive inheritance was observed in one case. The present study suggests that vanishing lung syndrome may be associated with autosomal dominant and recessive genetic inheritance."

In principle, combinatorial posttranslational modification of key lineage-specific transcription factors would be an effective means to integrate critical signaling events. Understanding how this might be achieved is central to deciphering the impact of microenvironmental cues in development and disease. The microphthalmia-associated transcription factor MITF plays a crucial role in the development of melanocytes, the retinal pigment epithelium, osteoclasts, and mast cells and acts as a lineage survival oncogene in melanoma. MITF coordinates survival, differentiation, cell-cycle progression, cell migration, metabolism, and lysosome biogenesis. However, how the activity of this key transcription factor is controlled remains poorly understood. Here, we show that GSK3, downstream from both the PI3K and Wnt pathways, and BRAF/MAPK signaling converges to control MITF nuclear export. Phosphorylation of the melanocyte MITF-M isoform in response to BRAF/MAPK signaling primes for phosphorylation by GSK3, a kinase inhibited by both PI3K and Wnt signaling. Dual phosphorylation, but not monophosphorylation, then promotes MITF nuclear export by activating a previously unrecognized hydrophobic export signal. Nonmelanocyte MITF isoforms exhibit poor regulation by MAPK signaling, but instead their export is controlled by mTOR. We uncover here an unanticipated mode of MITF regulation that integrates the output of key developmental and cancer-associated signaling pathways to gate MITF flux through the import-export cycle. The results have significant implications for our understanding of melanoma progression and stem cell renewal."

A Randomized Controlled Trial.\nRationale: Primary treatment of obstructive sleep apnea can be accompanied by a persistence of excessive sleepiness despite adherence. Furthermore, effectiveness of sleep apnea treatment is limited by poor adherence. Currently available pharmacologic options for the treatment of sleepiness in this population are limited. Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of solriamfetol (JZP-110), a selective dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor with robust wake-promoting effects, for the treatment of excessive sleepiness in participants with obstructive sleep apnea with current or prior sleep apnea treatment. Methods: This was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, 12-week trial comparing solriamfetol, 37.5, 75, 150, and 300 mg, with placebo. Measurements and Main Results: Of 476 randomized participants, 459 were included in the prespecified efficacy analyses. Coprimary endpoints (Maintenance of Wakefulness Test sleep latency and Epworth Sleepiness Scale score) were met at all solriamfetol doses (P < 0.05), with dose-dependent effects observed at Week 1 maintained over the study duration. All doses except 37.5 mg resulted in higher percentages of participants reporting improvement on Patient Global Impression of Change (key secondary endpoint; P < 0.05). Adverse events were reported in 47.9% of placebo- and 67.9% of solriamfetol-treated participants; five participants experienced serious adverse events (two [1.7%] placebo, three [0.8%] solriamfetol); none were deemed related to study drug. The most common adverse events with solriamfetol were headache (10.1%), nausea (7.9%), decreased appetite (7.6%), anxiety (7.0%), and nasopharyngitis (5.1%). Conclusions: Solriamfetol significantly increased wakefulness and reduced sleepiness in participants with obstructive sleep apnea and excessive sleepiness; most adverse events were mild or moderate in severity.

These fungi exist throughout the environment, especially in the soil, leaves, compost piles, or decaying woods. Humans contract mucormycosis by coming in contact with the spores from fungus either by inhalation or through cuts on the skin. The population at risk for this life-threatening infection includes diabetes mellitus patients, cancer patients, premature infants, burn patients, and immunocompromised patients. The fungi that most commonly cause mucormycosis are the Rhizopus species, and the least represented are Apophysomyces species. Common clinical manifestations of mucormycosis include pulmonary, cutaneous, rhinocerebral, and gastrointestinal mucormycosis. Cases of lung mucormycosis are often misdiagnosed because of non-specific clinical symptoms and radiological features, and in many cases, have been diagnosed as aspergillosis due to similarities in signs, symptoms, and imaging presentation of the lungs. We present a pediatric case of a 6-year-old from Togo who presented to our hospital in Nigeria with dyspnea, fever, and abdominal pain of five-day duration. The child's symptoms began 6-months prior, with dry cough, fever, fatigue, and chest pain and abdominal pain. The hospital in Togo where he lived suspected infection with tuberculosis (TB) despite a false-positive Mantoux test and negative chest X-ray. He was initially treated for TB with Isoniazid and vitamin B6 and was discharged home. Six months later, his symptoms have not improved, but became more severe with high grade fever 40  C (oral reading), anorexia, fatigue, tachypnea, abdominal distention, and cough. The patient was immediately referred to our hospital in Abuja, Nigeria where more specific tests were ordered.

The species most frequently identified as the etiological agents of mucormycosis belong to the genera Rhizopus, Lichtheimia, and Mucor. The frequency of systemic mucormycosis has been increasing, mainly because of increasing numbers of susceptible patients. Furthermore, Mucorales display intrinsic resistance to the majority of routinely used antifungal agents (e.g., echinocandins and short-tailed azoles), which limits the number of possible therapeutic options. All the above-mentioned issues urge the improvement of molecular identification methods and the discovery of new antifungal targets and strategies. Spore coat proteins (CotH) constitute a kinase family present in many pathogenic bacteria and fungi and participate in the spore formation in these organisms. Moreover, some of them can act as virulence factors being receptors of the human GRP78 protein during Rhizopus delemar-induced mucormycosis. We identified 17 cotH-like genes in the Mucor lusitanicus genome database. Successful disruption of five cotH genes in Mucor was performed using the CRISPR-Cas9 system. The CotH3 and CotH4 proteins play a role in adaptation to different temperatures as well as in developing the cell wall structure. We also show CotH4 protein is involved in spore wall formation by affecting the total chitin content and, thus, the composition of the spore wall. The role of CotH3 and CotH4 proteins in virulence was confirmed in two invertebrate models and a diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) mouse model. IMPORTANCE Current treatment options for mucormycosis are inadequate, resulting in high mortality rates, especially among immunosuppressed patients. The development of novel therapies for mucormycosis has been hampered by lack of understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms. The importance of the cell surface CotH proteins in the pathogenesis of Rhizopus-mediated mucormycosis has been recently described. However, the contribution of this family of proteins to the virulence of other mucoralean fungi and their functionality in vital processes remain undefined. Through the use of the CRISPR-Case9 gene disruption system, we demonstrate the importance of several of the CotH proteins to the virulence of Mucor lusitanicus by using three infection models. We also report on the importance of one of these proteins, CotH4, to spore wall formation by affecting chitin content. Therefore, our studies extend the importance of CotH proteins to Mucor and identify the mechanism by which one of the CotH proteins contributes to the development of a normal fungal cell wall, thereby indicating that this family of proteins can be targeted for future development of novel therapeutic strategies of mucormycosis."

In 2016, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization defined congenital Zika-associated syndrome (CZS) as a set of congenital anomalies seen in children born to mothers with a history of gestational Zika fever, who have microcephaly as the most prevalent clinical sign. In order to describe the magnitude of CZS in Brazil, this study estimated the burden of disease due to CZS in Brazil using the disability-adjusted life years (DALY) indicator and other frequency measures, such as incidence and mortality rate, during the years 2015-2020. The association of these indicators with socioeconomic variables was also evaluated using Spearman's correlation coefficient. Choropleth maps were used to evaluate the spatial distribution of the indicators evaluated and the spatial autocorrelation was verified by the Bivariate Moran Local Index.

High-risk clinical signs, mainly expressing basilar fractures (as rhinorrhea, otorrhea, focal neurologic signs, retroauricular hematoma) demonstrated high predictive value (100%) for intracranial sequelae. Other \"moderate risk\" findings for intracranial injury--i.e. loss of consciousness at any time, antegrade or retrograde amnesia, multiple trauma, and possible skull penetration--showed a high correlation with skull fractures and a slightly lower one with intracranial sequelae.

However, the anatomic features of type A IMH that develops dissection or rupture are unknown. The purpose of this study was to investigate the predictors of progression or regression of type A IMH by computed tomography (CT). METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty-two consecutive patients with type A IMH were studied by serial CT images. Aortic diameter and aortic wall thickness of the ascending aorta were estimated in CT images at 3 levels on admission and at follow-up (mean 37 days). We defined patients who showed increased maximum aortic wall thickness in the follow-up CT (n=9) or died of rupture (n=1) as the progression group (n=10). The other 12 patients, who all showed decreased maximum wall thickness, were categorized as the regression group. In the progression group, the maximum aortic diameter in the initial CT was significantly greater than that in the regression group (55+/-6 vs 47+/-3 mm, P=0.001). A Cox regression analysis revealed that the maximum aortic diameter was the strongest predictor for progression of type A IMH. We considered the optimal cutoff value to be 50 mm for the maximum aortic diameter to predict progression (positive predictive value 83%, negative predictive value 100%). CONCLUSIONS: Maximum aortic diameter estimated by the initial CT images is predictive for progression of type A IMH."

However, no information regarding tastin's function is available to date. The present study is aimed at understanding the role of tastin in mammalian cells. Hence, we examined the intracellular localization of tastin in human cell lines transfected with an expression vector encoding influenza virus haemagglutinin (HA)-tagged tastin. Ectopically expressed HA-tastin was seen as a pattern resembling the fibres that overlap the microtubular cytoskeleton. When HA-tastin-expressing cells were cultured with nocodazole to disrupt microtubule (MT) polymerization, tastin was dispersed to the entire cytoplasm and an MT sedimentation assay showed tastin in the supernatant; however, tastin was sedimented with polymeric MTs in cell lysates not treated with nocodazole. Sedimentation assays using HA-tastin mutants deleted at the N- or C-terminus revealed MT-binding activity associated with the N-terminal basic region of tastin. A yeast two-hybrid screen for tastin-interacting proteins identified Tctex-1, one of the light chains of cytoplasmic dynein, as a tastin-binding protein. Immunoprecipitation and Western-blot analysis confirmed binding of HA-tagged tastin and FLAG (Asp-Tyr-Lys-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys epitope)-tagged Tctex-1 in human cells. Furthermore, in vitro assays have demonstrated the binding between a fusion protein, glutathione S-transferase-Tctex-1, and in vitro translated (35)S-labelled tastin.

Organization emerges despite rearrangements that constantly shuffle gene and operon order. Evidence is presented that the tandem duplication of related genes acts as a driving evolutionary force in the origin and maintenance of clusters. Gene amplification can be viewed as a dynamic and reversible regulatory mechanism that facilitates adaptation to variable environments. Clustered genes confer selective benefits via their ability to be coamplified. During evolution, rearrangements that bring together related genes can be selected if they increase the fitness of the organism in which they reside. Similarly, the benefits of gene amplification can prevent the dispersal of existing clusters. Examples of frequent and spontaneous amplification of large genomic fragments are provided. The possibility is raised that tandem gene duplication works in concert with horizontal gene transfer as interrelated evolutionary forces for gene clustering."

This study was designed to establish the effectiveness of prospective HLA-B*5701 screening to prevent the hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir. METHODS: This double-blind, prospective, randomized study involved 1956 patients from 19 countries, who were infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and who had not previously received abacavir. We randomly assigned patients to undergo prospective HLA-B*5701 screening, with exclusion of HLA-B*5701-positive patients from abacavir treatment (prospective-screening group), or to undergo a standard-of-care approach of abacavir use without prospective HLA-B*5701 screening (control group). All patients who started abacavir were observed for 6 weeks. To immunologically confirm, and enhance the specificity of, the clinical diagnosis of hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir, we performed epicutaneous patch testing with the use of abacavir. RESULTS: The prevalence of HLA-B*5701 was 5.6% (109 of 1956 patients). Of the patients receiving abacavir, 72% were men, 84% were white, and 18% had not previously received antiretroviral therapy. Screening eliminated immunologically confirmed hypersensitivity reaction (0% in the prospective-screening group vs. 2.7% in the control group, P<0.001), with a negative predictive value of 100% and a positive predictive value of 47.9%. Hypersensitivity reaction was clinically diagnosed in 93 patients, with a significantly lower incidence in the prospective-screening group (3.4%) than in the control group (7.8%) (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: HLA-B*5701 screening reduced the risk of hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir. In predominantly white populations, similar to the one in this study, 94% of patients do not carry the HLA-B*5701 allele and are at low risk for hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir. Our results show that a pharmacogenetic test can be used to prevent a specific toxic effect of a drug. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00340080.)"

Mechanistic understanding of the role of RPS19 in normal erythropoiesis and in the Diamond-Blackfan anemia defect is still poor. However, defective ribosome biogenesis and, in particular, impaired 18S ribosomal RNA maturation have been documented in association with various identified RPS19 mutations. Recently, new genes, all encoding ribosomal proteins, have been found to be mutated in Diamond-Blackfan anemia, adding further support to the concept that ribosome biogenesis plays an important role in regulating erythropoiesis. We previously showed variability in the levels of expression and subcellular localization of a subset of RPS19 mutant proteins. DESIGN AND METHODS: To define the mechanistic basis for this variability better, we studied a large number of mutant proteins and characterized both RPS19 expression level using a specific antibody against RPS19 and RPS19 subcellular localization after transfection of Cos-7 cells with various green fluorescent protein-RPS19 mutants. To investigate the role of the proteasome in RPS19 degradation, we examined the effect of various proteasome inhibitors, namely lactacystin, MG132, and bortezomib on RPS19 expression and subcellular localization RESULTS: We found two distinct classes of RPS19 protein defects in Diamond-Blackfan anemia based on the stability of the mutant proteins: (i) slightly decreased to normal levels of expression and normal nucleolar localization and (ii) markedly deficient expression and failure to localize to the nucleolus. All the proteasome inhibitors tested were able to restore the expression levels and normal subcellular localization of several unstable mutant proteins. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate an important role for the proteasomal degradation pathway in regulating the expression levels and nucleolar localization of certain mutant RPS19 proteins in Diamond-Blackfan anemia."

Among the PADs, PAD2 is widely distributed in various tissues and is the only type that is expressed in brain. To elucidate the involvement of protein citrullination by PAD2 in the pathogenesis of brain-specific prion diseases, we examined the profiles of citrullinated proteins using the brains of scrapie-infected mice as a prion disease model. We found that, compared with controls, increased levels of citrullinated proteins of various molecular weights were detected in different brain sections of scrapie-infected mice. In support of this data, expression levels of PAD2 protein as well as its enzyme activity were significantly increased in brain sections of scrapie-infected mice, including hippocampus, brain stem, and striatum. Additionally, the expression levels of PAD2 mRNA were increased during scrapie infection. Moreover, PAD2 immunoreactivity was increased in scrapie-infected brains, with staining detected primarily in reactive astrocytes. Using two-dimensional electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry, various citrullinated proteins were identified in the brains of scrapie-infected mice, including glial fibrillary acidic protein, myelin basic protein, enolases, and aldolases. This study suggests that accumulated citrullinated proteins and abnormal activation of PAD2 may function in the pathogenesis of prion diseases and serve as potential therapeutic targets."

Our understanding of the function of phospholamban stems primarily from studies in genetically altered mouse models. To evaluate the significance of this protein in larger mammalian species, which exhibit Ca cycling properties similar to humans, we overexpressed phospholamban in adult rabbit cardiomyocytes. Adenoviral-mediated gene transfer, at high multiplicities of infection, resulted in an insignificant 1.22-fold overexpression of phospholamban. There were no effects on twitch Ca-transient amplitude or decay under basal or isoproterenol-stimulated conditions. Furthermore, the SR Ca load and Na/Ca exchanger function were not altered. These apparent differences between phospholamban overexpression in rabbit compared with previous findings in the mouse may be due to a significantly higher (1.5-fold) endogenous phospholamban-to-sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase (SERCA) 2a ratio and potential functional saturation of SERCA2a by phospholamban in rabbit cardiomyocytes. The findings suggest that important species-dependent differences in phospholamban regulation of SERCA2a occur. In larger mammals, a higher fraction of SERCA2a pumps are regulated by phospholamban, and this may influence therapeutic strategies to enhance cardiac contractility and functional cardiac reserve."

However, no approved anti-HER2/neu therapy is available for the majority of breast cancer patients, who express HER2/neu at low levels (with scores of 1+ or 2+/fluorescence in situ hybridization-negative). The trifunctional antibody ertumaxomab targets HER2/neu, CD3, and activating Fcgamma receptors. In presence of ertumaxomab, tri-cell complexes consisting of tumor cells, T cells, and accessory cells form to cause tumor cell lysis. In a phase I trial with metastatic breast cancer patients, ertumaxomab could be applied safely and resulted in radiographically confirmed clinical responses. In this study, we compare ertumaxomab- and trastuzumab-mediated killing of cancer cell lines that express HER2/neu at low and high levels. Under optimal conditions for trastuzumab-mediated destruction of HER2/neu-overexpressing cells, only ertumaxomab was able to mediate the elimination of tumor cell lines that express HER2/neu at low levels (1+). Ertumaxomab-mediated activity was accompanied by a Th1-based cytokine release, a unique mode of action of trifunctional antibodies. Competitive binding studies with trastuzumab and 520C9 mapped the binding site of ertumaxomab to the extracellular regions II and III of the HER2/neu ectodomain. This site is distinct from the binding site of trastuzumab, so that HER2/neu-expressing tumor cells can be eliminated by ertumaxomab in the presence of high amounts of trastuzumab. The ability of ertumaxomab to induce cytotoxicity against various tumor cell lines, including those with low HER2/neu antigen density, may provide a novel therapeutic option for breast cancer patients who are not eligible for trastuzumab treatment."

In brain, PAD2 is abundantly expressed and can be involved in citrullination in disease. Recently, we have reported pathological characterization of PAD2 and citrullinated proteins in scrapie-infected mice, but the implication of protein citrullination in the pathophysiology in human prion disease is not clear. In the present study, we explored the molecular and biological involvement of PAD2 and the pathogenesis of citrullinated proteins in frontal cortex of patients with sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD). We found increased expression of PAD2 in reactive astrocytes that also contained increased levels of citrullinated proteins. In addition, PAD activity was significantly elevated in patients with sCJD compared to controls. From two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF mass analysis, we found various citrullinated candidates, including cytoskeletal and energy metabolism-associated proteins such as vimentin, glial fibrillary acidic protein, enolase, and phosphoglycerate kinase. Based on these findings, our investigations suggest that PAD2 activation and aberrant citrullinated proteins could play a role in pathogenesis and have value as a marker for the postmortem classification of neurodegenerative diseases."

A regulatory molecule?\nBACKGROUND: Ameloblastoma is a benign odontogenic tumor, exhibiting local invasiveness and high rate of recurrence. Metallothionein is a protein associated with tumorigenesis, serving as prognostic factor in different neoplasms. We are interested in mechanisms underlying ameloblastoma local invasiveness. Thus, we decided to analyze expression of metallothionein in this tumor. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An immunohistochemical evaluation of metallothionein in ameloblastoma was carried out. As control, we assessed expression of the same molecule in calcifying cystic odontogenic tumor (CCOT), a non-invasive odontogenic neoplasm with ameloblastomatous epithelium. RESULTS: We studied 12 cases of solid/multicystic ameloblastomas. Metallothionein was observed in all samples. This molecule was observed in columnar cells in the periphery and in central polyhedral cells. CCOT (four cases) also showed the presence of metallothionein. Morphometry of stained areas showed that expression of metallothionein in ameloblastoma was significantly higher compared to CCOT (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: This protein may have an impact on ameloblastoma behavior. Metallothionein would act as a zinc reservoir for important proteases related to ameloblastoma biology, such as MMPs. This protein could also display pro-mitotic and anti-apoptotic features in the tumor."

Previous studies demonstrate that 6 of the established non-HLA CD and RA risk loci (out of 26 loci for each disease) are shared between both diseases. We hypothesized that there are additional shared risk alleles and that combining genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from each disease would increase power to identify these shared risk alleles. We performed a meta-analysis of two published GWAS on CD (4,533 cases and 10,750 controls) and RA (5,539 cases and 17,231 controls). After genotyping the top associated SNPs in 2,169 CD cases and 2,255 controls, and 2,845 RA cases and 4,944 controls, 8 additional SNPs demonstrated P<5 x 10(-8) in a combined analysis of all 50,266 samples, including four SNPs that have not been previously confirmed in either disease: rs10892279 near the DDX6 gene (P(combined) =  1.2 x 10(-12)), rs864537 near CD247 (P(combined) =  2.2 x 10(-11)), rs2298428 near UBE2L3 (P(combined) =  2.5 x 10(-10)), and rs11203203 near UBASH3A (P(combined) =  1.1 x 10(-8)). We also confirmed that 4 gene loci previously established in either CD or RA are associated with the other autoimmune disease at combined P<5 x 10(-8) (SH2B3, 8q24, STAT4, and TRAF1-C5). From the 14 shared gene loci, 7 SNPs showed a genome-wide significant effect on expression of one or more transcripts in the linkage disequilibrium (LD) block around the SNP. These associations implicate antigen presentation and T-cell activation as a shared mechanism of disease pathogenesis and underscore the utility of cross-disease meta-analysis for identification of genetic risk factors with pleiotropic effects between two clinically distinct diseases."

It is directly genotoxic by inducing DNA strand breaks and cytotoxic by promoting apoptosis in lung target cells. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP1) is a nuclear zinc-finger protein with a function as a DNA damage sensor. To determine whether PARP1 is involved in asbestos-induced carcinogenesis, PARP1 expression and activity as well as DNA damage and repair were evaluated in circulating cells of asbestos-exposed subjects, MM patients and age-matched controls. PARP1 expression and activity were also evaluated in pleural biopsies of MM patients and compared with normal tissue. Accumulation of the pre-mutagenic 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine and elevated PARP1 expression were found both in asbestos-exposed subjects and MM patients. Although PARP1 was highly expressed, its activity was relatively low. Low DNA repair efficiency was observed in lymphocytes from MM patients. High expression of PARP1 associated with low PARP activity was also found in MM biopsies. To mimic PARP1 dysfunction, PARP1 expression and activity were induced in immortalised mesothelial cells by their exposure to asbestos in the presence of a PARP1 inhibitor, which resulted in transformation of the cells. We propose that exposure to asbestos inhibits the PARP1 activity possibly resulting in higher DNA instability, thus causing malignant transformation."

RLS is a frequent and distressing comorbidity in end stage renal disease (ESRD). For idiopathic RLS (iRLS), genetic risk factors have been identified, but their role in RLS in ESRD has not been investigated yet. Therefore, a case-control association study of these variants in ESRD patients was performed. METHODS: The study genotyped 10 iRLS associated variants at four loci encompassing the genes MEIS1, BTBD9, MAP2K5/SKOR1, and PTPRD, in two independent case-control samples from Germany and Greece using multiplex PCR and MALDI-TOF (matrix assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight) mass spectrometry. Statistical analysis was performed as logistic regression with age and gender as covariates. For the combined analysis a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test was applied. RESULTS: The study included 200 RLS-positive and 443 RLS-negative ESRD patients in the German sample, and 141 and 393 patients, respectively, in the Greek sample. In the German sample, variants in MEIS1 and BTBD9 were associated with RLS in ESRD (P(nom)<=0.004, ORs 1.52 and 1.55), whereas, in the Greek sample, there was a trend for association to MAP2K5/SKOR1 and BTBD9 (P(nom)<=0.08, ORs 1.41 and 1.33). In the combined analysis including all samples, BTBD9 was associated after correction for multiple testing (P(corrected)=0.0013, OR 1.47). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first demonstration of a genetic influence on RLS in ESRD patients with BTBD9 being significantly associated. The extent of the genetic predisposition could vary between different subgroups of RLS in ESRD."

Operons that are coregulated are known to colocalize in the genome, suggesting that their spatial organization is under selection for efficient expression regulation. However, the internal order of genes within operons is believed to be poorly conserved, and hence expression requirements are claimed to be too weak to oppose gene rearrangements. In light of these opposing views, we set out to investigate whether the internal location of the regulatory genes within operons is under selection. Our analysis shows that transcription factors (TFs) are preferentially encoded as either first or last in their operons, in the two diverged model bacteria Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. In a higher resolution, we find that TFs that repress transcription of the operon in which they are encoded (autorepressors), contribute most of this signal by specific preference of the first operon position. We show that this trend is strikingly conserved throughout highly diverged bacterial phyla. Moreover, these autorepressors regulate operons that carry out highly diverse biological functions. We propose a model according to which autorepressors are selected to be located first in their operons in order to optimize transcription regulation. Specifically, the first operon position helps autorepressors to minimize leaky transcription of the operon structural genes, thus minimizing energy waste. Our analysis provides statistically robust evidence for a paradigm of bacterial autorepressor preferential operonic location. Corroborated with our suggested model, an additional layer of operon expression control that is common throughout the bacterial domain is revealed."

The authors hypothesized that the HOQ Cognitive Health score would demonstrate a relatively strong correlation with neuropsychological test scores, whereas much weaker correlations would be seen for HOQ Physical and Social-Emotional Health scores. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of children with long-standing hydrocephalus presenting to The Hospital for Sick Children's Neurosurgery Clinic was performed between July 2006 and September 2008. Participating children and families completed the HOQ and a battery of 21 standard neuropsychological tests and questionnaires. Pearson correlation analysis was then performed. RESULTS: A total of 83 patients (81% participation) was accrued; the mean age was 11.5 +- 3.4 years (mean +- SD) at the time of assessment. The mean age at hydrocephalus treatment was 1.3 +- 2.6 years. The mean overall HOQ score was 0.69 +- 0.21. The HOQ Cognitive score had a moderate or strong correlation with 19 (90%) of 21 neuropsychological test scores, much more so than the HOQ Social-Emotional score (5 moderate or strong correlations, 24%) and the HOQ Physical score (1 moderate correlation, 5%). For 19 neuropsychological tests (90%), the HOQ Cognitive score had a stronger correlation than the other scores. The HOQ Cognitive score had particularly strong correlations with the Verbal IQ, List Learning, Behavior Problems, and Metacognitive Abilities components. CONCLUSIONS: Data from a wide-ranging representative sample of children with long-standing hydrocephalus provide added evidence of the validity of the HOQ Cognitive score and the overall domain structure of the HOQ itself."

WS is classified into four subtypes (WS1-WS4) based on additional symptoms. PAX3 and SOX10 are two transcription factors that can activate the expression of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), a critical transcription factor for melanocyte development. Mutations of PAX3 are associated with WS1 and WS3, while mutations of SOX10 cause WS2 and WS4. Recently, we identified some novel WS-associated mutations in PAX3 and SOX10 in a cohort of Chinese WS patients. Here, we further identified an E248fsX30 SOX10 mutation in a family of WS2. We analyzed the subcellular distribution, expression and in vitro activity of two PAX3 mutations (p.H80D, p.H186fsX5) and four SOX10 mutations (p.E248fsX30, p.G37fsX58, p.G38fsX69 and p.R43X). Except H80D PAX3, which retained partial activity, the other mutants were unable to activate MITF promoter. The H80D PAX3 and E248fsX30 SOX10 were localized in the nucleus as wild type (WT) proteins, whereas the other mutant proteins were distributed in both cytoplasm and nucleus. Furthermore, E248fsX30 SOX10 protein retained the DNA-binding activity and showed dominant-negative effect on WT SOX10. However, E248fsX30 SOX10 protein seems to decay faster than the WT one, which may underlie the mild WS2 phenotype caused by this mutation."

Malignant ameloblastomas are tumors considered metastatic despite the appearance of well-differentiated or benign histology, while ameloblastic carcinomas are histologically malignant in both primary and metastatic sites. CASE PRESENTATION: A 24-year-old Moroccan man presented a malignant ameloblastoma of the mandible. The tumor was entirely resected. Five years later, a local recurrence occurred. Our patient was treated by exclusive radiotherapy with persistence of a residual disease. After two years he developed multiple lung metastases. Our patient received a combination chemotherapy using doxorubicin and cisplatin. CONCLUSION: Less than 50 cases of ameloblastoma with metastases have been reported.

Dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs) play a very important role in these events by modulating the extent of JNK phosphorylation and activation and thus regulating cellular responses to stress. M3/6 (DUSP8) is one of the dual-specificity protein phosphatases with distinct specificity towards JNK. It has been shown that M3/6 itself is phosphorylated by JNK upon stimulation with arsenite, but the role of this phosphorylation has not been investigated. In this study, we mapped JNK-induced phosphorylation sites on M3/6 using mass spectrometry. Phosphorylated residues Ser 515, Thr 518 and Ser 520 were identified and site-directed mutagenesis was employed to investigate their role. Upon arsenite stimulation, M3/6 mutated at these sites exhibited decreased phosphorylation compared to the wild-type protein. No difference was observed in terms of the enzyme's in vitro phosphatase activity, its substrate specificity towards JNK isoforms, its interactions with JNK and the scaffold family of JNK-interacting proteins (JIPs), its stability or its subcellular localization. Interestingly, expression of M3/6 phosphorylation mutants delayed the time-course of JNK phosphorylation and activation by arsenite. We propose that phosphorylation of the M3/6 phosphatase by JNK in response to stress stimuli results in attenuation of phosphatase activity and acceleration of JNK activation."

We evaluated the effect of an index combining age and stroke severity on response to IV tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) among patients in the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) tPA stroke trials. METHODS: We created the Stroke Prognostication using Age and NIH Stroke Scale (SPAN) index by combining age in years plus NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) >=100. We applied the SPAN-100 index to patients in the NINDS tPA stroke trials (parts I and II) to evaluate its ability to predict clinical response and risk of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) after thrombolysis. The main outcome measures included ICH (any type) and a composite favorable outcome (defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 0 or 1, NIHSS <=1, Barthel index >=95, and Glasgow Outcome Scale score of 1) at 3 months. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to determine the association between SPAN-100 and outcomes of interest. RESULTS: Among 624 patients in the NINDS trials, 62 (9.9%) participants were SPAN-100 positive. Among those receiving tPA, ICH rates were higher for SPAN-100-positive patients (42% vs 12% in SPAN-100-negative patients; p < 0.001); similarly, ICH rates were higher in SPAN-100-positive patients (19% vs 5%; p = 0.005) among those not receiving tPA. SPAN-100 was associated with worse outcomes. The benefit of tPA, defined as favorable composite outcome at 3 months, was present in SPAN-100-negative patients (55.4% vs 40.2%; p < 0.001), but not in SPAN-100-positive patients (5.6% tPA vs 3.9%; p = 0.76). Similar trends were found for secondary outcomes (e.g., symptomatic ICH, catastrophic outcome, discharge home). CONCLUSION: The SPAN-100 index could be a simple method for estimating the clinical response and risk of hemorrhagic complications after tPA for acute ischemic stroke.

        "text": "Potassium iodide (KI) to block the thyroid from exposure to I-131: current questions and answers to be discussed.\nThyroid cancer in children and adolescents has to be considered as the most severe health consequence of a nuclear reactor emergency with release of radioiodine into the atmosphere. High doses of potassium iodide are effective to block radioiodine thyroid uptake and to prevent development of thyroid cancer years later. However, there are controversies concerning thyroid cancer risk induced by radioiodine exposure in adults. Further, the interaction of nutritional supply of potassium iodide and radioiodine uptake as well as the interaction of radioiodine with certain drugs has not been addressed properly in existing guidelines and recommendations. How to proceed in case of repeated release of radioiodine is an open, very important question which came up again recently during the Fukushima accident. Lastly, the side effects of iodine thyroid blocking and alternatives of this procedure have not been addressed systematically up to now in guidelines and recommendations. These questions can be answered as follows: in adults, the risk to develop thyroid cancer is negligible. In countries, where nutritional iodine deficiency is still an issue, the risk to develop thyroid cancer after a nuclear reactor emergency has to be considered higher because the thyroid takes up more radioiodine as in the replete condition. Similarly, in patients suffering from thyrotoxicosis, hypothyroidism or endemic goitre not being adequately treated radioiodine uptake is higher than in healthy people. In case of repeated or continued radioiodine release, more than one dose of potassium iodide may be necessary and be taken up to 1 week. Repeated iodine thyroid blocking obviously is not harmful. Side effects of iodine thyroid blocking should not be overestimated; there is little evidence for adverse effects in adults. Newborns and babies, however, may be more sensitive to side effects. In the rare case of iodine hypersensitivity, potassium perchlorate may be applied as an alternative to iodine for thyroid blocking."

Although BLK has been reproducibly identified as a risk factor in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), reports are conflicting about the contribution of BANK1 to RA susceptibility. To ascertain the real impact of BANK1 on RA genetic susceptibility, we performed a large meta-analysis including our original data and tested for an epistatic interaction between BANK1 and BLK in RA susceptibility. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We investigated data for 1,915 RA patients and 1,915 ethnically matched healthy controls genotyped for BANK1 rs10516487 and rs3733197 and BLK rs13277113. The association of each SNP and RA was tested by logistic regression. Multivariate analysis was then used with an interaction term to test for an epistatic interaction between the SNPs in the 2 genes. RESULTS: None of the SNPs tested individually was significantly associated with RA in the genotyped samples. However, we detected an epistatic interaction between BANK1 rs3733197 and BLK rs13277113 (P(interaction)  = 0.037). In individuals carrying the BLK rs13277113 GG genotype, presence of the BANK1 rs3733197 G allele increased the risk of RA (odds ratio 1.21 [95% confidence interval 1.04-1.41], P = 0.015. Combining our results with those of all other studies in a large trans-ethnic meta-analysis revealed an association of the BANK1 rs3733197 G allele and RA (1.11 [1.02-1.21], P = 0.012). CONCLUSION: This study confirms BANK1 as an RA susceptibility gene and for the first time provides evidence for epistasis between BANK1 and BLK in RA. Our results illustrate the concept of pleiotropic epistatic interaction, suggesting that BANK1 and BLK might play a role in RA pathogenesis."

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The investigation included 104 patients; morphological examination showed minimal change disease in 15 (14.4%) patients, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis in 24 (23.1%), membrane nephropathy in 32 (30.8%), and IgA nephropathy (mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis) in 33 (31.7%). The investigators analyzed the clinical type of nephropathy, performed conventional laboratory and instrumental examinations, and determined the level of CysC (by immunoturbodimetry) and NGAL (by enzyme immunoassay) in the serum and daily urine taken before kidney biopsy. The degree of glomerulosclerosis, tubulointerstititial sclerosis, and tubular atrophy was semiquantitatively estimated. RESULTS: Urinary CysC and NGAL excretion correlated with the degree of glomerulosclerosis and proteinuria and the reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR) regardless of the method of its determination. The urinary level of NGAL positively correlated with the degree of tubular atrophy. The GFR value determined from serum CysC and creatinine levels more precisely reflected the degree of glomerulosclerosis. CONCLUSION: The tubulointerstitial compartment in primary glomerulopathies should be determined not only by morphological changes, but also by tubular function parameters by estimating the urinary excretion of biomarkers. The urinary content of CysC reflects tubular epithelial dysfunction whereas that of NGAL also characterizes tubular atrophy. To estimate the degree of glomerulosclerosis, it is more preferable to use the GFR calculated from the blood concentrations of CysC and creatinine, by keeping in mind clinical findings (using Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration formula, 2012)."

Although certain chromatin features, such as the histone acetyltransferase P300 and the histone modification H3K4me1, indicate the presence of enhancers, only a fraction of enhancers are functionally active. Individual chromatin marks, such as H3K27ac and H3K27me3, have been identified to distinguish active from inactive enhancers. However, the systematic identification of the most informative single modification, or combination thereof, is still lacking. Furthermore, the discovery of enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) provides an alternative approach to directly predicting enhancer activity. However, it remains challenging to link chromatin modifications to eRNA transcription. Herein, we develop a logistic regression model to unravel the relationship between chromatin modifications and eRNA synthesis. We perform a systematic assessment of 24 chromatin modifications in fetal lung fibroblast and demonstrate that a combination of four modifications is sufficient to accurately predict eRNA transcription. Furthermore, we compare the ability of eRNAs and H3K27ac to discriminate enhancer activity. We demonstrate that eRNA is more indicative of enhancer activity. Finally, we apply our fibroblast trained model to six other cell-types and successfully predict eRNA synthesis. Thus, we demonstrate the learned relationships are general and independent of cell-type. We provided a powerful tool to identify active enhancers and reveal the relationship between chromatin modifications, eRNA production and enhancer activity. "

CASE REPORT: A 88-years-old female (body-mass-index = 19.95) with AF, hypertension and diabetes mellitus, hospitalized because of heart failure and a non-convulsive epileptic state, was treated by valproate, mirtazepin, nebivolol, digitoxin, lisinopril, gliclazide and amlodipine. Irrespective of renal insufficiency, rivaroxaban 15 mg/d was started. After 3 days rivaroxaban was stopped because of concerns about the bleeding risk. Coagulation tests 28 h after rivaroxaban-intake showed INR 2.26, PT 35%, aPTT 38.3 s and anti-Factor Xa-activity 2.00 U/ml. Explanations for the prolonged anticoagulant activity of rivaroxaban comprise renal failure, the low body-mass-index, the advanced age and drug-drug interactions of rivaroxaban with mirtazepin, valproate and amlodipine. CONCLUSION: Health care providers should consider renal function, concomitant medication, polymorbidity and age prior to prescribing rivaroxaban.

METHODS: We analyzed PDCD10 small interfering RNA-treated endothelial cells for stress fibers, Rho kinase activity, and permeability. Rho kinase activity was assessed in cerebral cavernous malformation lesions. Brain permeability and cerebral cavernous malformation lesion burden were quantified, and clinical manifestations were assessed in prospectively enrolled subjects with PDCD10 mutations. RESULTS: We determined that PDCD10 protein suppresses endothelial stress fibers, Rho kinase activity, and permeability in vitro. Pdcd10 heterozygous mice have greater lesion burden than other Ccm genotypes. We demonstrated robust Rho kinase activity in murine and human cerebral cavernous malformation vasculature and increased brain vascular permeability in humans with PDCD10 mutation. Clinical phenotype is exceptionally aggressive compared with the more common KRIT1 and CCM2 familial and sporadic cerebral cavernous malformation, with greater lesion burden and more frequent hemorrhages earlier in life. We first report other phenotypic features, including scoliosis, cognitive disability, and skin lesions, unrelated to lesion burden or bleeding.

Prolactinomas cause hypogonadism, infertility, osteoporosis, and tumor mass effects, and are the most common type of neuroendocrine tumor. In this review, we highlight signaling pathways involved in lactotrope development, homeostasis, and physiology of pregnancy, as well as implications for signaling pathways in pathophysiology of prolactinoma. We also review mutations found in human prolactinoma and briefly discuss animal models that are useful in studying pituitary adenoma, many of which emphasize the fact that alterations in signaling pathways are common in prolactinomas. Although individual mutations have been proposed as possible driving forces for prolactinoma tumorigenesis in humans, no single mutation has been clinically identified as a causative factor for the majority of prolactinomas. A better understanding of lactotrope-specific responses to intracellular signaling pathways is needed to explain the mechanism of tumorigenesis in prolactinoma. "

All forms of Bartter syndrome are characterized by hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, and secondary hyperaldosteronism, but Bartter syndrome type 3 has the most heterogeneous presentation, extending from severe to very mild. A relatively large number of CLCNKB mutations have been reported, including gene deletions and nonsense or missense mutations. However, only 20 CLCNKB mutations have been functionally analyzed, due to technical difficulties regarding ClC-Kb functional expression in heterologous systems. This review provides an overview of recent progress in the functional consequences of CLCNKB mutations on ClC-Kb chloride channel activity. It has been observed that 1) all ClC-Kb mutants have an impaired expression at the membrane; and 2) a minority of the mutants combines reduced membrane expression with altered pH-dependent channel gating. Although further investigation is needed to fully characterize disease pathogenesis, Bartter syndrome type 3 probably belongs to the large family of conformational diseases, in which the mutations destabilize channel structure, inducing ClC-Kb retention in the endoplasmic reticulum and accelerated channel degradation."

Here we demonstrate that a disintegrin and metalloproteinase-17 (ADAM17), a main sheddase for tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, is essential for defensive epithelial properties against UC by promoting epithelial cell growth and goblet cell differentiation in mouse and human. Mice with systemic deletion of Adam17 developed severe dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis when compared to mice with myeloid cell Adam17 deletion or control littermates. ADAM17 was predominantly expressed by regenerating epithelia in control mice, and its loss or inhibition attenuated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation, epithelial proliferation, mucus production and barrier functions. Conversely, ectopic EGFR stimulation promoted epithelial regeneration thereby partially rescuing the severe colitis caused by ADAM17 deficiency. In UC patients, epithelial ADAM17 expression positively correlated with both cell proliferation and goblet cell number. These findings suggest that maintaining ADAM17-EGFR epithelial signaling is necessary for the recovery from UC and would be beneficial to therapeutic strategies targeting ADAM17-mediated TNF-alpha shedding.

In addition to bleeding, unexpected thrombosis, spontaneous spleen ruptures, painful bone cysts and intrahepatic inclusions can complicate the clinical course of patients with quantitative fibrinogen disorders. Clinical manifestations of dysfibrinogenaemia include absence of symptoms, major bleeding or thrombosis as well as systemic amyloidosis.

Improving accuracy of diagnosis, performing genotype, analysing function of fibrinogen variants and carefully investigating the personal and familial histories may lead to a better assessment of patients' phenotype and therefore help in identifying patients at increased risk of adverse clinical outcomes.

Current management is antibiotic therapy, antenatal corticosteroids and to plan delivery at 37 weeks gestation. The microbiota and probiotics are potentially protective and may improve outcomes. AIMS: The primary aim is to evaluate whether oral probiotic therapy (Lactobacillus fermentum CECT5716) administered during PPROM between 24 and 34 weeks gestation prolongs pregnancy duration. The secondary aim is to evaluate maternal and neonatal outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a pragmatic, multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised controlled trial in Australia. The population will be women with a singleton pregnancy and PPROM less than 34 weeks gestation. The intervention will be an oral probiotic therapy compared with a placebo control. The primary outcome will be the proportion of women still pregnant at seven days following PPROM. One-to-one randomisation will occur within 24 h of PPROM.

Maintenance dosing every 4 weeks is well established with IL-17 inhibitors for psoriasis. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the possible dosing interval during bimekizumab maintenance therapy to maintain clear skin, to inform phase III studies. METHODS: Forty-nine patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis received bimekizumab 320 mg at weeks 0/4, followed at week 16 by bimekizumab 320 mg (n = 17) or placebo (n = 32). Efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity and biopsy transcriptomic analyses were assessed to week 28. RESULTS: At week 8, 47% of patients achieved a 100% improvement from baseline in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 100), increasing to 57% at week 12 (8 weeks after the second dose) before decreasing. In those who received bimekizumab at week 16, PASI 100 rate increased to comparable peak levels at week 20, but reduced by week 28 to 41% (12 weeks after the third dose). The week 8 transcriptional signature observed in lesional psoriatic skin rapidly normalized to levels consistent with nonlesional skin, resulting in molecular remission. Keratinocyte-related gene products such as CXCL1 (C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 1), IL-8 (encoded by the CXCL8 gene), CCL20 (C-C motif chemokine 20), IL-36gamma and IL-17C were profoundly normalized to levels associated with nonlesional skin. CONCLUSIONS: Here, inhibition of IL-17F in addition to IL-17A resulted in rapid, deep clinical responses. Additionally, profound normalization of keratinocyte biology and the psoriatic transcriptome was observed, including normalization of both IL17 and IL23 gene expression by week 8.

These include microvascular and macrovascular thrombotic complications such as arterial and venous thromboembolism, myocardial injury or inflammation resulting in infarction, heart failure, and arrhythmias. Data suggest increased risk of adverse outcomes in pregnant compared with nonpregnant women of reproductive age with COVID-19 infection, including need for intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation utilization. Current statements addressing COVID-19-associated cardiac complications do not include pregnancy complications that may mimic COVID-19 complications such as peripartum cardiomyopathy, spontaneous coronary artery dissection, and preeclampsia. Unique to pregnancy, COVID-19 complications can result in preterm delivery and modify management of the pregnancy. Moreover, pregnancy has often been an exclusion criterion for enrollment in research studies. In this review, we summarize what is known about pregnancy-associated COVID-19 cardiovascular complications."

The incidence and prevalence of T1DM are increasing, making this one of the most common diseases of childhood. The disease is associated with significant morbidity and mortality with patients experiencing reduced quality of life and decreased life expectancy compared with the general population. Patients become dependent on exogenous insulin which has been the primary treatment since its first clinical use over 100 years ago. Although there have been advancements in glucose monitoring technology and insulin delivery devices, most patients fail to meet glycemic targets. Research has therefore focused on different treatment options to delay or prevent disease progression. Monoclonal antibodies have previously been utilized to suppress the immune response following an organ transplant and were subsequently studied for their ability to treat autoimmune diseases. Teplizumab, a monoclonal antibody (manufactured by Provention Bio and marketed as Tzield), was recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration as the first preventative treatment for T1DM. The approval came after a 3-decade history of research and development. This article provides an overview of the discovery and mechanism of action of teplizumab, as well as the clinical trials that led to its approval."

Exogenous insulin therapy can save lives but does not halt disease progression. Thus, an effective therapy may require beta-cell restoration and suppression of the autoimmune response. However, currently, there are no treatment options available that can halt T1D. Within the National Clinical Trial (NCT) database, a vast majority of over 3000 trials to treat T1D are devoted to insulin therapy. This review focuses on non-insulin pharmacological therapies. Many investigational new drugs fall under the category of immunomodulators, such as the recently FDA-approved CD-3 monoclonal antibody teplizumab. Four intriguing candidate drugs fall outside the category of immunomodulators, which are the focus of this review. Specifically, we discuss several non-immunomodulators that may have more direct action on beta cells, such as verapamil (a voltage-dependent calcium channel blocker), gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA, a major neurotransmitter with effects on beta cells), tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA, an endoplasmic reticulum chaperone), and volagidemab (a glucagon receptor antagonist). These emerging anti-diabetic drugs are expected to provide promising results in both beta-cell restoration and in suppressing cytokine-derived inflammation."

Point mutations in the genes of this family are common, particularly in KRAS. These mutations were thought to cause the constitutive activation of KRAS, but recent findings showed that some mutants can cycle between active and inactive states. This observation, together with the development of covalent KRASG12C inhibitors, has led to the arrival of KRAS inhibitors in the clinic. However, most patients develop resistance to these targeted therapies, and we lack effective treatments for other KRAS mutants. To accelerate the development of RAS targeting therapies, we need to fully characterise the molecular mechanisms governing KRAS signalling networks and determine what differentiates the signalling downstream of the KRAS mutants. Here we have used affinity purification mass-spectrometry proteomics to characterise the interactome of KRAS wild-type and three KRAS mutants. Bioinformatic analysis associated with experimental validation allows us to map the signalling network mediated by the different KRAS proteins. Using this approach, we characterised how the interactome of KRAS wild-type and mutants is regulated by the clinically approved KRASG12C inhibitor Sotorasib. In addition, we identified novel crosstalks between KRAS and its effector pathways including the AKT and JAK-STAT signalling modules."

Here we aimed to determine whether bradykinin protects the heart at reperfusion by modulating the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening through glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK-3beta). Bradykinin given at reperfusion reduced infarct size in isolated rat hearts subjected to 30 min regional ischemia followed by 2 h of reperfusion. The infarct-limiting effect of bradykinin was reversed by atractyloside, an opener of the mPTP, suggesting that bradykinin may protect the heart at reperfusion by modulating the mPTP opening. In support of this observation, bradykinin prevented the collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)), an index of the mPTP opening. Bradykinin increased GSK-3beta phosphorylation at reperfusion, and the selective inhibitor of GSK-3beta SB216763 reduced infarct size and prevented the loss of DeltaPsi(m) by mimicking the effect of bradykinin. The effect of bradykinin on GSK-3beta phosphorylation was blocked by wortmannin and LY294002, and bradykinin increased Akt phosphorylation at reperfusion. Further experiments showed that the MEK inhibitor PD98059 prevented the effect of bradykinin on GSK-3beta. However, the mTOR/p70s6K pathway inhibitor rapamycin did not alter bradykinin-induced GSK-3beta phosphorylation and bradykinin failed to alter phosphorylation of either mTOR or p70s6K at reperfusion. Taken together, these data suggest that bradykinin protects the heart at reperfusion by modulating the mPTP opening through inhibition of GSK-3beta. The PI3-kinase/Akt pathway and ERK, but not the mTOR/p70s6K pathway account for the suppression of GSK-3beta by bradykinin."

Uber-operons represent a rich set of footprints of operon evolution, whose full utilization could lead to new and more powerful tools for elucidation of biological pathways and networks than what operons have provided, and a better understanding of prokaryotic genome structures and evolution. Our prediction algorithm predicts uber-operons through identifying groups of functionally or transcriptionally related operons, whose gene sets are conserved across the target and multiple reference genomes. Using this algorithm, we have predicted uber-operons for each of a group of 91 genomes, using the other 90 genomes as references. In particular, we predicted 158 uber-operons in Escherichia coli K12 covering 1830 genes, and found that many of the uber-operons correspond to parts of known regulons or biological pathways or are involved in highly related biological processes based on their Gene Ontology (GO) assignments. For some of the predicted uber-operons that are not parts of known regulons or pathways, our analyses indicate that their genes are highly likely to work together in the same biological processes, suggesting the possibility of new regulons and pathways. We believe that our uber-operon prediction provides a highly useful capability and a rich information source for elucidation of complex biological processes, such as pathways in microbes. All the prediction results are available at our Uber-Operon Database: http://csbl.bmb.uga.edu/uber, the first of its kind."

I(f)-channel inhibition mainly reduces HR, thereby improving myocardial oxygen supply, energy balance, and cardiac function. Ivabradine was well tolerated and revealed a good safety profile in the investigated study populations. The guiding experimental and clinical results of I(f)-channel inhibition were compared to those of beta-blockade as a HR reducing principle as well as cornerstone of heart failure standard therapy. Beside its use in therapy of coronary artery disease, I(f)-channel inhibition potentially exhibits beneficial effects in systolic and diastolic heart failure as well. Therefore, hemodynamic effects of ivabradine and its limitations in heart failure together with the biological impact of HR reduction will be considered in this context. Because no clinical data with specific heart-rate-reducing agents are available in heart failure patients until now, the prospective significance of I(f)-channel inhibition can only be speculated on.

Here, we tested the hypothesis that enhanced endothelial apoptotic microparticles and decreased endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) levels might contribute to the pathophysiology of microalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria in cardiovascular disease. METHODS: Flow cytometry was used to assess endothelial cell apoptosis and circulating EPC levels by quantification of circulating CD31/annexin V apoptotic microparticles and EPC markers (defined as KDRCD133, CD34CD133, CD34KDR) in peripheral blood. RESULTS: In total, 125 patients with hypertension were enrolled in the study, of whom 80 patients (64%) were with normoalbuminuria (albumin excretion rate of <20 microg/min, overnight urine samples), 35 patients (28%) with microalbuminuria (an albumin excretion rate of 20-200 microg/min), and 10 patients (8%) with macroalbuminuria (an albumin excretion rate >200 microg/min). Compared to hypertensive patients with normoalbuminuria, patients with microalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria had significantly more diabetes (P = 0.005), higher systolic blood pressure (P = 0.018), and elevated serum creatinine levels (P < 0.001). Among the three groups, patients with microalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria had significantly increased CD31/annexin V apoptotic microparticles (1.8 +/- 2.2 versus 3.0 +/- 4.3 versus 5.2 +/- 6.2%, P = 0.044) and decreased circulating EPC numbers (P < 0.05). By multivariate analysis, CD31/annexin V apoptotic microparticle level was an independent predictor of urinary albumin excretion rate in hypertensive patients (P < 0.001). Microparticles isolated from hypertensive patients with microalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria attenuated EPC proliferation, migration, and increased H2O2 production, cellular senescence and apoptosis in comparison with those from hypertensive patients with normoalbuminuria. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that hypertensive patients with microalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria have increased endothelial apoptotic microparticles and decreased circulating EPC levels, which may contribute to atherosclerotic disease progression and enhanced cardiovascular risk in hypertensive patients with nephropathy."

Little is known about the posttranscriptional regulation of RGS4 expression. We cloned the full-length cDNA of rabbit RGS4, which contains a long 3'-untranslated region (UTR) with several AU-rich elements (AREs). We determined whether RGS4 mRNA stability is mediated by the RNA-binding protein human antigen R (HuR) and contributes to IL-1beta-induced upregulation of RGS4 expression. We show that IL-1beta treatment in colonic smooth muscle cells doubled the half-life of RGS4 mRNA. Addition of RGS4 3'-UTR to the downstream of Renilla luciferase reporter induced dramatic reduction in the enzyme activity and mRNA expression of luciferase, which was attenuated by the site-directed mutation of the two 3'-most ARE sites. IL-1beta increased luciferase mRNA stability in a UTR-dependent manner. Knockdown of HuR significantly aggravated UTR-mediated instability of luciferase and inhibited IL-1beta-induced upregulation of RGS4 mRNA. In addition, IL-1beta increased cytosolic translocation and RGS4 mRNA binding of HuR. These findings suggest that 3'-most ARE sites within RGS4 3'-UTR are essential for the instability of RGS4 mRNA and IL-1beta promotes the stability of RGS4 mRNA through HuR."

Although abnormal Ca(2+) release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum through ryanodine receptors (RyR2) has been linked to arrhythmogenesis, the molecular mechanisms triggering release of arrhythmogenic Ca(2+) remain unknown. We tested the hypothesis that increased RyR2 phosphorylation by Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II is both necessary and sufficient to promote lethal ventricular arrhythmias. METHODS AND RESULTS: mice in which the S2814 Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II site on RyR2 is constitutively activated (S2814D) develop pathological sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) release events, resulting in reduced sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) load on confocal microscopy. These Ca(2+) release events are associated with increased RyR2 open probability in lipid bilayer preparations. At baseline, young S2814D mice have structurally and functionally normal hearts without arrhythmias; however, they develop sustained ventricular tachycardia and sudden cardiac death on catecholaminergic provocation by caffeine/epinephrine or programmed electric stimulation. Young S2814D mice have a significant predisposition to sudden arrhythmogenic death after transverse aortic constriction surgery. Finally, genetic ablation of the Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II site on RyR2 (S2814A) protects mutant mice from pacing-induced arrhythmias versus wild-type mice after transverse aortic constriction surgery. CONCLUSIONS: our results suggest that Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II phosphorylation of RyR2 Ca(2+) release channels at S2814 plays an important role in arrhythmogenesis and sudden cardiac death in mice with heart failure."

METHODS: This was an open-label extension phase of a prospective, phase 1-2 trial (NCT00411619) in patients >=3 years of age with SEGA associated with TSC. Patients received oral everolimus starting at 3 mg/m2 per day and subsequently titrated, subject to tolerability, to attain whole blood trough concentrations of 5-15 ng/mL. Change in SEGA volume, seizures, and safety assessments were the main outcome measures. RESULTS: Of 28 patients enrolled, 25 were still under treatment at the time of analysis. Median dose was 5.3 mg/m2/day and median treatment duration was 34.2 months (range 4.7-47.1). At all time points (18, 24, 30, and 36 months), primary SEGA volume was reduced by >=30% from baseline (treatment response) in 65%-79% of patients. All patients reported >=1 adverse event (AE), mostly grade 1/2 in severity, consistent with that previously reported, and none led to everolimus discontinuation. The most commonly reported drug-related AEs were upper respiratory infections (85.7%), stomatitis (85.7%), sinusitis (46.4%), and otitis media (35.7%). No drug-related grade 4 or 5 events occurred. CONCLUSION: Everolimus therapy is safe and effective for longer term (median exposure 34.2 months) treatment of patients with TSC with SEGA. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class III evidence that everolimus, titrated to trough serum levels of 5-15 ng/mL, was effective in reducing tumor size in patients with SEGA secondary to TSC for a median of 34 months."

Natural cellular RNA substrates of mammalian Pol II, however, have not been identified and the cellular function of the Pol II RdRP activity is unknown. We found that Pol II can use a non-coding RNA, B2 RNA, as both a substrate and a template for its RdRP activity. Pol II extends B2 RNA by 18 nt on its 3'-end in an internally templated reaction. The RNA product resulting from extension of B2 RNA by the Pol II RdRP can be removed from Pol II by a factor present in nuclear extracts. Treatment of cells with alpha-amanitin or actinomycin D revealed that extension of B2 RNA by Pol II destabilizes the RNA. Our studies provide compelling evidence that mammalian Pol II acts as an RdRP to control the stability of a cellular RNA by extending its 3'-end."

In recent years, a substantial advance has been performed in the identification of the genes that increase the risk to develop RA. Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have allowed the characterization of more than 40 new susceptibility genes and the confirmation of a marked differential genetic background between patients expressing anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPA, approximately 80% of all RA patients) and ACPA negative RA patients. GWAS have also confirmed the existence of a common genetic basis between RA and other autoimmune diseases and the overrepresentation of specific biological pathways like antigen presentation and TNF signaling. Dense genotyping analysis has also allowed the detailed characterization of the different association signals within the HLA region, the strongest risk locus for RA. In the present manuscript, we also review the most recent advances in the genetics of clinically relevant subphenotypes in RA which are the response to treatment and the severity of the disease. In the next years the increasing ability to characterize the DNA variation and the availability of well characterized patient cohorts will be critical to translate genetic information into the much awaited personalized medicine in RA."

Ninety percent of cases occur in infants <6 months old. The infants typically present with vague symptoms such as hypotonia and poor feeding. This article reports an infant with confirmed infantile botulism that presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with complaints of decreased feeding and absence of bowel movements for >1 week. OBJECTIVES: Review a case of infantile botulism, its diagnosis, and treatment. CASE REPORT: A 4-month-old healthy Caucasian male presented to the ED with a 6-day history of decreased feeding after referral from the pediatrician. He had not had a bowel movement for 9 days, and his parents were also concerned about increasing weakness, as he was no longer able to hold his head up on his own. In the ED, he was minimally interactive. His vital signs were within normal limits, and he had hypoactive bowel sounds and decreased tone throughout. He was admitted to the Children's Hospital and eventually transferred to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. The botulism immunoglobulin was administered, and a diagnosis was confirmed with positive botulinum toxin in the stool samples. Full recovery was made by the infant. CONCLUSION: Awareness of the symptoms of botulism and a high degree of clinical suspicion is needed to make a prompt diagnosis."

It has become an important research line in the development of gene therapy to overcome the drawbacks of single-gene therapy. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the usefulness of double-suicide gene therapy with the two suicide genes, gef and apoptin, in colon carcinoma. METHODS: gef and apoptin genes were cloned into a doxycycline-regulated retrovirus-mediated gene expression system. Expression of both genes in the DLD-1 cell line was confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Cell viability was determined with the sulforhodamine B colorimetric assay, and the cell cycle was studied by propidium iodide (PI) staining. Annexin V-FITC and PI assays were used to evaluate apoptosis, and the results were confirmed by electron microscopy. The mitochondrial membrane potential was measured by JC-1 assay. RESULTS: Our results showed that the combined expression of gef and apoptin genes was strikingly more effective than the expression of either gene alone. Co-expression of gef and apoptin synergistically enhanced the decrease in cell viability, increasing necrosis and inducing apoptosis in colon cancer cells via the mitochondrial pathway, which can be deficient in advanced or metastatic colon cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Double-suicide gene therapy based on gef and apoptin genes may be a candidate for the development of new colon cancer strategies, and further studies are warranted to establish the usefulness of double-suicide gene therapy in vivo."

Unvaccinated populations experience 20 to 50% fatality. Few studies have examined the pathophysiological changes that occur in humans during YFV infection due to the sporadic nature and remote locations of outbreaks. Rhesus macaques are highly susceptible to YFV infection, providing a robust animal model to investigate host-pathogen interactions. In this study, we characterized disease progression as well as alterations in immune system homeostasis, cytokine production and gene expression in rhesus macaques infected with the virulent YFV strain DakH1279 (YFV-DakH1279). Following infection, YFV-DakH1279 replicated to high titers resulting in viscerotropic disease with ~72% mortality. Data presented in this manuscript demonstrate for the first time that lethal YFV infection results in profound lymphopenia that precedes the hallmark changes in liver enzymes and that although tissue damage was noted in liver, kidneys, and lymphoid tissues, viral antigen was only detected in the liver. These observations suggest that additional tissue damage could be due to indirect effects of viral replication. Indeed, circulating levels of several cytokines peaked shortly before euthanasia. Our study also includes the first description of YFV-DakH1279-induced changes in gene expression within peripheral blood mononuclear cells 3 days post-infection prior to any clinical signs. These data show that infection with wild type YFV-DakH1279 or live-attenuated vaccine strain YFV-17D, resulted in 765 and 46 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), respectively. DEGs detected after YFV-17D infection were mostly associated with innate immunity, whereas YFV-DakH1279 infection resulted in dysregulation of genes associated with the development of immune response, ion metabolism, and apoptosis. Therefore, WT-YFV infection is associated with significant changes in gene expression that are detectable before the onset of clinical symptoms and may influence disease progression and outcome of infection.

To identify nucleosomes with alternative structures genome-wide, we used H4S47C-anchored cleavage mapping, which revealed that 5% of budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) nucleosome positions have asymmetric histone-DNA interactions. These asymmetric interactions are enriched at nucleosome positions that flank promoters. Micrococcal nuclease (MNase) sequence-based profiles of asymmetric nucleosome positions revealed a corresponding asymmetry in MNase protection near the dyad axis, suggesting that the loss of DNA contacts around H4S47 is accompanied by protection of the DNA from MNase. Chromatin immunoprecipitation mapping of selected nucleosome remodelers indicated that asymmetric nucleosomes are bound by the RSC chromatin remodeling complex, which is required for maintaining nucleosomes at asymmetric positions. These results imply that the asymmetric nucleosome-RSC complex is a metastable intermediate representing partial unwrapping and protection of nucleosomal DNA on one side of the dyad axis during chromatin remodeling.

The intrinsic limitations of the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R), including non-linearity, multidimensionality and floor-effect, have emerged and its usefulness argued. The ALS Milano-Torino staging (ALS-MITOS) system was proposed as a novel tool to measure the progression of ALS and overcome these limitations. This study was performed to validate the ALS-MITOS as a 6-month proxy of survival in 200 ALS patients followed up to 18 months. METHODS: Analyses were performed on data from the recombinant human erythropoietin RCT that failed to demonstrate differences between groups for both primary and secondary outcomes. The ALS-MITOS system is composed of four key domains included in the ALSFRS-R scale (walking/self-care, swallowing, communicating and breathing), each with a threshold reflecting the loss of function in the specific ALSFRS-R subscores. Sensitivity, specificity and the area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic curves of the ALS-MITOS system stages and ALSFRS-R decline at 6 months were calculated and compared with the primary outcome (survival, tracheotomy or >23-hour non-invasive ventilation) at 12 and 18 months Predicted probabilities of the ALS-MITO system at 6 months for any event at 12 and 18 months were computed through logistic regression models. RESULTS: Disease progression from baseline to 6 months as defined by the ALS-MITOS system predicted death, tracheotomy or >23-hour non-invasive ventilation at 12 months with 82% sensitivity (95% CI 71% to 93%, n=37/45) and 63% specificity (95% CI 55% to 71%, n=92/146), and at 18 months with 71% sensitivity (95% CI 61% to 82%, n=50/70) and 68% specificity (95% CI 60% to 77%, n=76/111). The analysis of ALS-MITOS and ALSFRS-R progression at 6-month follow-up showed that the best cut-off to predict survival at 12 and 18 months was 1 for the ALS-MITOS (ie, loss of at least one function) and a decline ranging from 6 to 9 points for the ALSFRS-R. CONCLUSIONS: The ALS-MITOS system can reliably predict the course of ALS up to 18 months and can be considered a novel and valid outcome measure in RCTs."

However, the complete range of patients and locations in which these tumors arise, as well as the morphologic spectrum and associated genetic alterations remain undefined. Here, we describe a series of 47 diffuse midline gliomas with histone H3-K27M mutation. The 25 male and 22 female patients ranged in age from 2 to 65 years (median = 14). Tumors were centered not only in the pons, thalamus, and spinal cord, but also in the third ventricle, hypothalamus, pineal region and cerebellum. Patients with pontine tumors were younger (median = 7 years) than those with thalamic (median = 24 years) or spinal (median = 25 years) tumors. A wide morphologic spectrum was encountered including gliomas with giant cells, epithelioid and rhabdoid cells, primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET)-like foci, neuropil-like islands, pilomyxoid features, ependymal-like areas, sarcomatous transformation, ganglionic differentiation and pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (PXA)-like areas. In this series, histone H3-K27M mutation was mutually exclusive with IDH1 mutation and EGFR amplification, rarely co-occurred with BRAF-V600E mutation, and was commonly associated with p53 overexpression, ATRX loss (except in pontine gliomas), and monosomy 10."

METHODS: Sixty-eight patients with IBD (35 ulcerative colitis [UC] and 33 crohn disease [CD]) and 65 healthy volunteers were included in the study. Rachmilewitz scoring system (endoscopic activity index [EAI]) was used to determine UC activity, and as for CD activity, CD activity index (CDAI) scoring was used. IMA measurement was performed with ELISA kit. RESULTS: Ischemia-modified albumin levels in IBD, UC, and CD groups were comparably higher than the control group (37.7 ng/mL vs 42.4 ng/mL vs 36.4 ng/mL vs 21.8 ng/mL, respectively; P < 0.05). In IBD group, a positive correlation was identified between IMA level and CRP (r = 0.325, P = 0.011), EAI(r = 0.302, P = 0.020), and CDAI (r = 0.311, P = 0.013). In stepwise regression model; it was identified that IMA(OR = 1.496; P = 0.016) and CRP(OR = 3.457; P = 0.015) are predictors of IBD in comparison with the control group. In linear regression model, it was identified that risk factors such as log(IMA) and log(CRP) were independent predictors of log(CDAI) and log(EAI) levels. CONCLUSION: This is the first study showing that IMA levels in IBD were determined higher in comparison with the control group. Moreover, IMA being a predictor for IBD and being positively correlated with disease activity indexes were determined for the first time in the study. In accordance with these results, it is possible to say that IMA in IBD might be related with the pathogenesis of disease and correlated with the severity of the disease."

In oncology patients, the safety cannot yet be guaranteed, since current tumor detection methods can only exclude the presence of malignant cells in ovarian fragments that are not transplanted. We determined the need for a novel detection method by studying the distribution of tumor cells in ovaries from patients with breast cancer. Furthermore, we examined which cell-surface proteins are suitable as a target for non-invasive tumor-specific imaging of ovarian metastases from invasive breast cancer. METHODS: Using the nationwide database of the Dutch Pathology Registry (PALGA), we identified a cohort of 46 women with primary invasive breast cancer and ovarian metastases. The localization and morphology of ovarian metastases were determined on hematoxylin-and-eosin-stained sections. The following cell-surface markers were immunohistochemically analyzed: E-cadherin, epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), human epidermal growth receptor type 2 (Her2/neu), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), alphavbeta6 integrin and epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM). RESULTS: The majority of ovarian metastases (71%) consisted of a solitary metastasis or multiple distinct nodules separated by uninvolved ovarian tissue, suggesting that ovarian metastases might be overlooked by the current detection approach. Combining the targets E-cadherin, EMA and Her2/neu resulted in nearly 100% detection of ductal ovarian metastases, whereas the combination of EMA, Her2/neu and EpCAM was most suitable to detect lobular ovarian metastases. CONCLUSIONS: Examination of the actual ovarian transplants is recommended. A combination of targets is most appropriate to detect ovarian metastases by tumor-specific imaging."

We have characterized the population pharmacokinetics (PK) of trastuzumab deruxtecan and released drug (topoisomerase I inhibitor) in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer or other solid tumor malignancies. This analysis includes pooled data from five clinical studies with 639 patients. Trastuzumab deruxtecan doses ranged from 0.8 to 8.0 mg/kg every 3 weeks. Serum concentrations of trastuzumab deruxtecan and released drug were analyzed using a sequential two-step approach, with the nonlinear mixed-effects modeling methods. Covariate assessment was based upon stepwise forward-addition and backward-elimination process, followed by both univariate and multivariate analysis quantifying their impact on steady-state exposure of trastuzumab deruxtecan and released drug. A two-compartment model with linear elimination best described PK profiles of intact trastuzumab deruxtecan, while a one-compartment model with time-varying release-rate constant and linear elimination described released-drug PK profiles. Statistically significant covariates (country, tumor size, sex, formulation, age, body weight, albumin, total bilirubin, and aspartate aminotransferase) resulted in < 20% change in steady-state area under the concentration-time curve of trastuzumab deruxtecan and released drug, except for increased body weight (95th percentile, 86 kg) and decreased albumin (5th percentile, 31 g/L). Analysis of patients stratified by country, race, renal function, and hepatic function found no clinically meaningful differences in steady-state exposure of intact trastuzumab deruxtecan or released drug.

Anticipation and worsening of clinical picture in subsequent generations were repeatedly reported, but there is no indication that SCA3/MJD frequency is changing. Thus, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis on phenomena with potential effect on SCA3/MJD recurrency in populations: instability of CAG repeat transmissions, anticipation, fitness, and segregation of alleles. Transmission of the mutant allele was associated with an increase of 1.23 CAG repeats in the next generation, and the average change in age at onset showed an anticipation of 7.75 years per generation; but biased recruitments cannot be ruled out. Affected SCA3/MJD individuals had 45% more children than related controls. Transmissions from SCA3/MJD carriers showed that the expanded allele was segregated in 64% of their children. In contrast, transmissions from normal subjects showed that the minor allele was segregated in 54%. The present meta-analysis concluded that there is a segregation distortion favoring the expanded allele, among children of carriers. Therefore, further studies on transmissions and anticipation phenomena as well as more observations about fertility are required to clarify these selective forces over SCA3/MJD."

The aim of this study was to determine the safety and efficacy of gemogenovatucel-T in front-line ovarian cancer maintenance. METHODS: This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2b trial involved 25 hospitals in the USA. Women aged 18 years and older with stage III/IV high-grade serous, endometrioid, or clear cell ovarian cancer in clinical complete response after a combination of surgery and five to eight cycles of chemotherapy involving carboplatin and paclitaxel, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group status of 0 or 1 were eligible for inclusion in the study. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to gemogenovatucel-T or placebo by an independent third party interactive response system after successful screening using randomly permuted block sizes of two and four and stratified by extent of surgical cytoreduction and neoadjuvant versus adjuvant chemotherapy. Gemogenovatucel-T (1 x 107 cells per injection) or placebo was administered intradermally (one per month) for a minimum of four and up to 12 doses. Patients, investigators, and clinical staff were masked to patient allocation until after statistical analysis. The primary endpoint was recurrence-free survival, analysed in the per-protocol population. All patients who received at least one dose of gemogenovatucel-T were included in the safety analysis. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02346747. FINDINGS: Between Feb 11, 2015, and March 2, 2017, 310 patients consented to the study at 22 sites. 217 were excluded. 91 patients received gemogenovatucel-T (n=47) or placebo (n=44) and were analysed for safety and efficacy. The median follow-up from first dose of gemogenovatucel-T was 40 0 months (IQR 35 0-44 8) and from first dose of placebo was 39 8 months (35 5-44 6). Recurrence-free survival was 11 5 months (95% CI 7 5-not reached) for patients assigned to gemogenovatucel-T versus 8 4 months (7 9-15 5) for patients assigned to placebo (HR 0 69, 90% CI 0 44-1 07; one-sided p=0 078). Gemogenovatucel-T resulted in no grade 3 or 4 toxic effects. Two patients in the placebo group had five grade 3 toxic events, including arthralgia, bone pain, generalised muscle weakness, syncope, and dyspnea. Seven patients (four in the placebo group and three in the gemogenovatucel-T group) had 11 serious adverse events. No treatment-related deaths were reported in either of the groups. INTERPRETATION: Front-line use of gemogenovatucel-T immunotherapy as maintenance was well tolerated but the primary endpoint was not met. Further investigation of gemogenovatucel-T in patients stratified by BRCA mutation status is warranted. FUNDING: Gradalis."

We carried out a multi-cohort meta-analysis of blood transcriptomic data available in public databases, including 11 different studies and 1209 samples from virus- (n = 695) and bacteria- (n = 514) infected patients. We applied a Parallel Regularized Regression Model Search (PReMS) on a set of previously reported genes that distinguished viral from bacterial infection to find a minimum gene expression bio-signature. This strategy allowed us to detect three genes, namely BAFT, ISG15 and DNMT1, that clearly differentiate groups of infection with high accuracy (training set: area under the curve (AUC) 0.86 (sensitivity: 0.81; specificity: 0.87); testing set: AUC 0.87 (sensitivity: 0.82; specificity: 0.86)). BAFT and ISG15 are involved in processes related to immune response, while DNMT1 is related to the preservation of methylation patterns, and its expression is modulated by pathogen infections. We successfully tested this three-transcript signature in the 11 independent studies, demonstrating its high performance under different scenarios. The main advantage of this three-gene signature is the low number of genes needed to differentiate both groups of patient categories."

We assessed psychometric properties of the Psoriasis Symptoms and Impacts Measure (P-SIM), developed to capture patients' experiences of signs, symptoms and impacts of psoriasis. METHODS: Pooled, blinded, 16-week data from 1002 patients in the BE VIVID and BE READY bimekizumab phase 3 trials were analysed. The suitability of the P-SIM missing score rule (weekly scores considered missing if >= 4 daily scores were missing) was assessed. Test-retest reliability was evaluated using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). Convergent validity was assessed between P-SIM and relevant patient-reported outcome (PRO) (Dermatology Life Quality Index [DLQI], DLQI item 1 [skin symptoms], Patient Global Assessment of Psoriasis) and clinician-reported outcome (ClinRO) scores (Psoriasis Area and Severity Index [PASI], Investigator's Global Assessment [IGA]) at baseline and week 16. Known-groups validity was assessed, comparing P-SIM scores between patient subgroups predefined using PASI/IGA scores. Sensitivity to change over 16 weeks was evaluated; responder definition (RD) thresholds were explored. RESULTS: The missing score rule used did not impact P-SIM scores. Test-retest reliability analyses demonstrated excellent score reproducibility (ICC 0.91-0.98). Inter-item correlations at baseline and week 16 were strong (> 0.5), apart from \"choice of clothing\" with \"skin pain\" and \"burning\" at baseline (both 0.49). All P-SIM scores were moderately to strongly correlated with other outcomes, demonstrating convergent validity, apart from ClinROs (PASI, IGA) at baseline that had low variability. P-SIM scores discriminated known groups at week 16, confirming known-groups validity. Changes from baseline to week 16 in P-SIM and other clinically relevant outcomes were strongly correlated (> 0.5; weaker with ClinROs), establishing sensitivity to change. Anchor-based RD analyses determined a four-point P-SIM item score decrease as indicative of marked clinically meaningful improvement. CONCLUSION: P-SIM scores demonstrated good reliability, validity and sensitivity to change. A four-point RD threshold could be used to assess 16-week treatment effects.

Almost a third of women with uterine fibroids seek treatment. The objective of this review is to understand the mechanisms linking fibroids to these symptoms and evaluate different options for their management, particularly the place of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist. (2) Methods: We gathered the most recent and relevant papers on the main fibroid-related symptoms and medical and surgical therapy for their treatment. Those reporting use of oral GnRH antagonists were investigated in detail. (3) Results: The mechanisms explaining myoma-related HMB and infertility were reviewed, as they are essential to a deeper mechanistic understanding and oriented approach. The choice of treatment depends on the number, size, and location of fibroids, and is guided by the patient's age and desire to preserve her fertility. Economic impacts of myomas in terms of direct costs, lost workdays, and complications were found to be significant. Medical, surgical, and non-surgical strategies were analyzed in this context. Novel medical approaches with GnRH antagonist were explored and found to represent an effective new option. (4) Conclusion: The need for alternatives to surgical intervention is very real, especially for women seeking to preserve their fertility. New options now exist, with GnRH antagonists proven to treat fibroid symptoms effectively, opening the door to novel strategies for the management of myomas."

R. oryzae), the Principal Global Agent of Mucormycosis in Humans.\nMucormycosis is a highly aggressive angio-invasive disease of humans caused by fungi in the zygomycete order, Mucorales. Though a number of different species can cause mucormycosis, the principal agent of the disease worldwide is Rhizopus arrhizus, which accounts for the majority of rhino-orbital-cerebral, pulmonary, and disseminated infections in immunocompromised individuals. It is also the main cause of life-threatening infections in patients with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, and in corticosteroid-treated patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, where it causes the newly described disease, COVID-19-associated mucormycosis (CAM). Diagnosis currently relies on non-specific CT, a lengthy and insensitive culture from invasive biopsy, and a time-consuming histopathology of tissue samples. At present, there are no rapid antigen tests for the disease that detect biomarkers of infection, and which allow point-of-care diagnosis. Here, we report the development of an IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb), KC9, which is specific to Rhizopus arrhizus var. arrhizus (syn. Rhizopus oryzae) and Rhizopus arrhizus var. delemar (Rhizopus delemar), and which binds to a 15 kDa extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) antigen secreted during hyphal growth of the pathogen. Using the mAb, we have developed a competitive lateral-flow device (LFD) that allows rapid (30 min) and sensitive (~50 ng/mL running buffer) detection of the EPS biomarker, and which is compatible with human serum (limit of detection of ~500 ng/mL) and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (limit of detection of ~100 ng/mL). The LFD, therefore, provides a potential novel opportunity for the non-invasive detection of mucormycosis caused by Rhizopus arrhizus."

Several agents targeting KRAS G12C have recently entered clinical development. Sotorasib, a first-in-class specific small molecule that irreversibly inhibits KRAS G12C, has since obtained Health Canada approval. The emergence of novel KRAS-targeted therapies warrants the development of evidence-based consensus recommendations to help clinicians better understand and contextualize the available data. A Canadian expert panel was convened to define the key clinical questions, review recent evidence, and discuss and agree on recommendations for the treatment of advanced KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC. The panel agreed that testing for KRAS G12C should be performed as part of a comprehensive panel that includes current standard-of-care biomarkers. Sotorasib, the only approved KRAS G12C inhibitor in Canada, is recommended for patients with advanced KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC who progressed on guideline-recommended first-line standard of care for advanced NSCLC without driver alterations (immune-checkpoint inhibitor(s) [ICIs] +/- chemotherapy). Sotorasib could also be offered as second-line therapy to patients who progressed on ICI monotherapy that are not candidates for a platinum doublet and those that received first-line chemotherapy with a contraindication to ICIs. Preliminary data indicate the activity of KRAS G12C inhibitors in brain metastases; however, the evidence is insufficient to make specific recommendations. Regular liver function monitoring is recommended when patients are prescribed KRAS G12C inhibitors due to risk of hepatotoxicity."

As an alternative to pathogen detection, host gene expression signatures in blood have shown promise in discriminating several infectious and inflammatory diseases in a dichotomous manner. However, differential diagnosis requires simultaneous consideration of multiple diseases. Here, we show that diverse infectious and inflammatory diseases can be discriminated by the expression levels of a single panel of genes in blood. METHODS: A multi-class supervised machine-learning approach, incorporating clinical consequence of misdiagnosis as a \"cost\" weighting, was applied to a whole-blood transcriptomic microarray dataset, incorporating 12 publicly available datasets, including 1,212 children with 18 infectious or inflammatory diseases. The transcriptional panel identified was further validated in a new RNA sequencing dataset comprising 411 febrile children. FINDINGS: We identified 161 transcripts that classified patients into 18 disease categories, reflecting individual causative pathogen and specific disease, as well as reliable prediction of broad classes comprising bacterial infection, viral infection, malaria, tuberculosis, or inflammatory disease. The transcriptional panel was validated in an independent cohort and benchmarked against existing dichotomous RNA signatures. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that classification of febrile illness can be achieved with a single blood sample and opens the way for a new approach for clinical diagnosis.

These are all hallmarks of some autoimmune diseases. Yaa is a Y-chromosome-linked gene that accelerates autoimmune diseases in some autoimmune-prone strains of mice. To further elucidate a possible relationship with autoimmunity, the effect of the Yaa gene on MAIDS was investigated. Analysis of phenotypic and functional disease parameters revealed that Yaa does not accelerate MAIDS disease. This is probably due to the generalized activation of most or all lymphoid cells in MAIDS, which cannot be enhanced by the Yaa gene. This result is in accordance with the selective enhancing effect of the Yaa gene on the immune response against self and foreign antigens in a specific genetic background. It suggests that the autoimmune response associated with MAIDS is a secondary phenomenon. Interestingly, even in wild-type C57BL/6 mice, autoantibody production may contribute overproportionally to the hypergammaglobulinemia associated with MAIDS."

Instead of using human materials during the implantation period, two human tumor cell lines that respectively mimic the biological behaviors of a blastocyst and uterine luminal epithelial cells were utilized successfully to identify three novel adhesion molecules named trophinin, bystin, and tastin. Trophinin is a membrane protein strongly expressed both on the apical surface of the trophectoderm of a simian blastocyst and at a putative implantation site of the human endometrium. Bystin and tastin are cytoplasmic proteins that associate with trophinin by presumably forming an active adhesion machinery. The expression patterns of these molecules are suggestive of their involvement in the initial blastocyst attachment to the uterus as well as in the subsequent placental development. Future perspectives in molecular implantation research are also discussed in relation to breakthroughs in assisted reproduction."

The distribution of [18F]annexin V and technetium-99m labelled annexin V, a well-characterised SPET tracer for apoptosis imaging, was compared. [18F]annexin V was synthesised using N-succinimidyl 4-[18F]fluorobenzoate as an 18F labelling reagent. Synthesised and purified [18F]annexin V was confirmed by SDS-PAGE.

In ischaemic animals, accumulation of [18F]annexin V and [(99m)Tc]annexin V in the infarct area was about threefold higher than in the non-infarct area. Furthermore, the ratio of accumulation in the normal heart to the blood radioactivity was not significantly different between the tracers. In normal animals, however, the uptake of [18F]annexin V in the liver, spleen and kidney was much lower than that of [(99m)Tc]annexin V.

METHODS: We subjected purified plasma cells from the bone marrow of patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma and control subjects to oligonucleotide microarray profiling and biochemical and immunohistochemical analyses to identify molecular determinants of osteolytic lesions. RESULTS: We studied 45 control subjects, 36 patients with multiple myeloma in whom focal lesions of bone could not be detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and 137 patients in whom MRI detected such lesions. Different patterns of expression of 57 of approximately 10,000 genes from purified myeloma cells could be used to distinguish the two groups of patients (P<0.001). Permutation analysis, which adjusts the significance level to account for multiple comparisons in the data sets, showed that 4 of these 57 genes were significantly overexpressed by plasma cells from patients with focal lesions. One of these genes, dickkopf 1 (DKK1), and its corresponding protein (DKK1) were studied in detail because DKK1 is a secreted factor that has been linked to the function of osteoblasts. Immunohistochemical analysis of bone marrow-biopsy specimens showed that only myeloma cells contained detectable DKK1. Elevated DKK1 levels in bone marrow plasma and peripheral blood from patients with multiple myeloma correlated with the gene-expression patterns of DKK1 and were associated with the presence of focal bone lesions. Recombinant human DKK1 or bone marrow serum containing an elevated level of DKK1 inhibited the differentiation of osteoblast precursor cells in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: The production of DKK1, an inhibitor of osteoblast differentiation, by myeloma cells is associated with the presence of lytic bone lesions in patients with multiple myeloma."

RESULTS: Cerebral cavernous malformations are venous malformations that can be detected with gradient echo MRI of the brain. Approximately 0.5% of the general population have the sporadic form with a single or a few cerebral cavernous malformations which mostly are asymptomatic. Those with the familial form usually have several cavernous malformations caused by an autosomal dominant condition. So far, 3 loci have been identified: CCM1 on chromosome 7q, CCM2 on chromosome 7p, and CCM3 on chromosome 3q, occurring in, respectively, approximately 40%, 20% and 40% of the families. CCM1 is caused by a mutation in the KRIT1 gene and CCM2 is caused by a mutation in the MGC4607 gene, while the gene for CCM3 is not yet identified. Mean age at onset is 20-40, but onset can occur at all ages. The most frequent symptoms are seizures, cerebral haemorrhage, chronic headache and focal neurological deficits. Many carriers are, however, asymptomatic. INTERPRETATION: Sporadic cerebral cavernous malformation is often asymptomatic, while the familial form shows phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity.

These drugs were developed based on the hypothesis whereby selective inhibition of the COX enzyme would lead to reduction in pain and inflammation without associated gastrointestinal and bleeding risks. However, in September 2004, rofecoxib was voluntarily removed from the market for increased cardiovascular risk and in April 2005, valdecoxib was also withdrawn, at least in part, due to excess cardiovascular risk. Celecoxib was the first COX-2 inhibitor introduced and the only remaining one on the US market. There is consequently a justified concern that cardiovascular toxicity is a class effect of all COX-2 inhibitors. This article systematically reviews the evidence surrounding COX-2 inhibitors and cardiovascular risk. Although the evidence suggests a fairly consistent cardiovascular risk with rofecoxib, the evidence for cardiovascular risk with celecoxib is more equivocal. Although isolated studies have suggested some cardiovascular risk for celecoxib, the totality of the evidence suggests that any risk is likely to be small and comparable to traditional NSAIDs. The cardiovascular risks of COX-2 inhibitors appear heterogeneous, influenced not only by the drug class, but also individual drug, dosage and patient characteristics. Specific modifying factors of the cardiovascular risk of COX-2 inhibitors including dose, concomitant drugs, individual cardiac and genetic risk profiles, will require further study."

Our data suggest that functional interactions between Sost or Wise and LRP5/LRP6 have the potential to regulate bone deposition by modulating the Wnt pathway. INTRODUCTION: The human disease sclerosteosis exhibits an increase in bone mass thought to be caused by hyperactive osteoblasts. Sclerostin, SOST, the gene affected in this disease, has been postulated to exert its activity by functioning as a BMP antagonist. However, recent evidence indicates that SOST is highly related to Wise, which can also modulate the Wnt pathway by binding to LRP5 and LRP6. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For this study, we used cell culture to test the BMP and Wnt activity function of both Wise and Sost. In addition, we used Xenopus in vivo Wnt assays along with Xenopus in vitro Wnt assays to support our cell culture results. Epitope tagged cell supernatants containing either Sost or soluble mutant or wildtype LRP5/LRP6 were used for immunoprecipitation. Sost immunoprecipitation results were confirmed in vivo using cell culture. Finally, to support our in vitro data, we co-localized Sost, Wise, LRP5, and LRP6 in mouse long bone sections. RESULTS: In this study, we report in vitro and in vivo evidence to show that Sost physically interacts with Lrp5 and Lrp6 and inhibits the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. Furthermore, using in vitro and in vivo assays, we showed that a variant of LRP5 (LRP5(G171V)) known to cause the human high bone mass (HBM) trait and a homologous change in LRP6 (LRP6(G158V)) abolished protein interactions with Sost. We used variants of Sost amino acids to further identify the contact points between Sost and LRP6. In Xenopus and mammalian cell culture assays, we showed that SOST is able to attenuate Wnt signaling and that this attenuation can be rescued by the addition of alpha-Sost antibodies or by the introduction of single amino acid substitution that alter its binding to LRP6. Sost differs from Wise in that it is unable to stimulate Wnt signaling. Using immunohistochemistry, we found that Sost and Wise are co-localized to osteoblasts, along with LRP5 and LRP6. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that functional interactions between Sost or Wise and LRPs have the potential to regulate bone deposition by modulating Wnt signaling."

CaMKII is upregulated in heart failure where arrhythmias are common, and CaMKII inhibition can reduce arrhythmias. Thus, CaMKII-dependent channel modulation may contribute to acquired arrhythmic disease. We developed a Markovian Na(+) channel model including CaMKII-dependent changes, and incorporated it into a comprehensive myocyte action potential (AP) model with Na(+) and Ca(2+) transport. CaMKII shifts Na(+) current (I(Na)) availability to more negative voltage, enhances intermediate inactivation, and slows recovery from inactivation (all loss-of-function effects), but also enhances late noninactivating I(Na) (gain of function). At slow heart rates, with long diastolic time for I(Na) recovery, late I(Na) is the predominant effect, leading to AP prolongation (long QT syndrome). At fast heart rates, where recovery time is limited and APs are shorter, there is little effect on AP duration, but reduced availability decreases I(Na), AP upstroke velocity, and conduction (Brugada syndrome). CaMKII also increases cardiac Ca(2+) and K(+) currents (I(Ca) and I(to)), complicating CaMKII-dependent AP changes. Incorporating I(Ca) and I(to) effects individually prolongs and shortens AP duration. Combining I(Na), I(Ca), and I(to) effects results in shortening of AP duration with CaMKII. With transmural heterogeneity of I(to) and I(to) downregulation in heart failure, CaMKII may accentuate dispersion of repolarization. This provides a useful initial framework to consider pathways by which CaMKII may contribute to arrhythmogenesis."

The authors' aim was to quantify the QOL for children with hydrocephalus and identify predictors of long-term outcome, using a reliable and validated outcome measure: the Hydrocephalus Outcome Questionnaire (HOQ). METHODS: All children (5-18 years old) with treated hydrocephalus attending the neurosurgery outpatient clinic at the Hospital for Sick Children were asked to participate. The patient's QOL was measured by the parent-completed HOQ. Predictor variables were extracted from the medical records. Multivariable linear regression was used to identify those predictor variables that were significantly associated with outcome. RESULTS: There was an 89% participation rate, with a total of 346 children participating (mean age 11.7 years, mean duration since diagnosis 9.9 years). Their mean HOQ Overall Health score was 0.68 (on a scale of 0 [worst QOL] to 1.0 [best QOL]). On multivariable analysis, the following predictors were associated with a worse overall QOL: increased seizure frequency, increased length of stay (LOS) in the hospital for the initial treatment of hydrocephalus, increased LOS for treatment of shunt infection and shunt overdrainage, increased number of proximal shunt catheters in situ, and increased distance of the family residence from the pediatric neurosurgical center. CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, these results establish baseline QOL values for a typical large group of children many years after their diagnosis of hydrocephalus, by using a validated and reproducible outcome measure. Many of the factors that adversely impact QOL appear to be related to shunt complications and might, therefore, be modifiable."

Classic laboratory findings in all variants include hypochloremia, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis with excessive excretion of chloride and potassium. Classic Bartter syndrome, neonatal Bartter syndrome, and Gitelman syndrome are the three main clinical variants. Classic Bartter syndrome and neonatal Bartter syndrome have defects in genes that affect transport channels in the ascending loop of Henle, where as in Gitleman syndrome the defect occurs in the transport channels of the distal convoluted tubule.

        "text": "Subclinical hypothyroidism might increase the risk of transient atrial fibrillation after coronary artery bypass grafting.\nBACKGROUND: Some studies have proposed that subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) has adverse effects on the cardiovascular system, but little is known about the effect on patients undergoing cardiovascular operations. We examined the influence of preoperative SCH on postoperative outcome in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). METHODS: Among patients who underwent CABG between July 2005 and June 2007 at Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, 224 with normal thyroid function and 36 with SCH were enrolled. Preoperative risks and postoperative outcomes were evaluated prospectively without thyroid hormone replacement. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in primary outcomes (major adverse cardiovascular events) and secondary outcomes such as wound problems, mediastinitis, leg infection, respiratory complications, delirium, or reoperation during the same hospitalization. However, patients with SCH had a higher incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation than those with normal thyroid function after adjustment for age, gender, body mass index, and other independent variables such as emergency operation, the use of cardiopulmonary bypass, combined valvular operation, preoperative creatinine levels, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, and nonuse of beta-blockers (45.5% vs 29%; odds ratio, 2.552; 95% confidence interval, 1.117 to 5.830; p = 0.026). CONCLUSIONS: SCH appears to influence the postoperative outcome for patients by increasing the development of postoperative atrial fibrillation. However, it is still unproven whether preoperative thyroxine replacement therapy for patients with SCH might prevent postoperative atrial fibrillation after CABG."

Environmental stresses can trigger methylation changes and this may have evolutionary consequences, even in the absence of sequence variation. However, it remains largely unknown to what extent environmentally induced methylation changes are transmitted to offspring, and whether observed methylation variation is truly independent or a downstream consequence of genetic variation between individuals. *Genetically identical apomictic dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) plants were exposed to different ecological stresses, and apomictic offspring were raised in a common unstressed environment. We used methylation-sensitive amplified fragment length polymorphism markers to screen genome-wide methylation alterations triggered by stress treatments and to assess the heritability of induced changes. *Various stresses, most notably chemical induction of herbivore and pathogen defenses, triggered considerable methylation variation throughout the genome. Many modifications were faithfully transmitted to offspring. Stresses caused some epigenetic divergence between treatment and controls, but also increased epigenetic variation among plants within treatments. *These results show the following. First, stress-induced methylation changes are common and are mostly heritable. Second, sequence-independent, autonomous methylation variation is readily generated. This highlights the potential of epigenetic inheritance to play an independent role in evolutionary processes, which is superimposed on the system of genetic inheritance."

Although patients with MGUS are generally asymptomatic and currently managed by \"watch and wait,\" the identification of high-risk patients whose disease will progress more rapidly to smoldering MM (SMM) and MM aids in timely intervention. The immunomodulatory agents thalidomide and lenalidomide and the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib are now routine components of MM therapy in both first-line and relapsed/ refractory settings. These targeted agents are used in various combinations with chemotherapy for the treatment of both transplantation-ineligible and transplantation-eligible patients. More recently, a trend toward evaluation of 3- and 4-drug multiagent combinations before transplantation and prolongation of primary therapy has generated new treatment paradigms. Ultimately, the physician's choice of therapy and treatment strategy requires consideration of regimen-associated toxicities and integration of the patient's risk, comorbid status, and response and tolerability of previous treatment regimens. Particular attention needs to be paid to baseline and/or treatment-emergent peripheral neuropathy, thrombotic risk, changes in renal function, and bone health. Despite recent advances, all patients with MM eventually relapse, and efforts to identify novel synergistic combinations and new agents are ongoing. This review highlights challenges in the clinic and newer approaches under evaluation for the treatment and/or management of patients with MGUS, SMM, and MM."

Mutations of p53 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are rare but resistance to chemotherapy has been reported because of the deregulation of the p53 signaling and differentiation pathways. It is known that the interaction of the vitamin D metabolite 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25D) with its functional vitamin D receptor leads to differentiation, G(1) arrest, and increased cell survival in p53-null AML cells. However, there are no reports on the effect of 1,25D in leukemia cells expressing wild-type p53. Here, we examine vitamin D signaling in AML cells MOLM-13 and OCI-AML3 expressing wild-type p53 in the presence and absence of the MDM2 antagonist nutlin-3. We find that 1,25D alone induces monocytic differentiation in these cell lines similar to that seen in p53-null AML cells, suggesting that the presence of wild-type p53 is compatible with activation of vitamin D signaling. Combination of nutlin-3a with 1,25D accelerated programmed cell death, likely because of enhanced nutlin-induced upregulation of the proapoptotic PIG-6 protein and downregulation of antiapoptotic BCL-2, MDMX, human kinase suppressor of Ras 2, and phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2."

An alternative may be the use of everolimus, which inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin, a protein regulated by gene products involved in the tuberous sclerosis complex. METHODS: Patients 3 years of age or older with serial growth of subependymal giant-cell astrocytomas were eligible for this open-label study. The primary efficacy end point was the change in volume of subependymal giant-cell astrocytomas between baseline and 6 months. We gave everolimus orally, at a dose of 3.0 mg per square meter of body-surface area, to achieve a trough concentration of 5 to 15 ng per milliliter. RESULTS: We enrolled 28 patients. Everolimus therapy was associated with a clinically meaningful reduction in volume of the primary subependymal giant-cell astrocytoma, as assessed on independent central review (P<0.001 for baseline vs. 6 months), with a reduction of at least 30% in 21 patients (75%) and at least 50% in 9 patients (32%). Marked reductions were seen within 3 months and were sustained. There were no new lesions, worsening hydrocephalus, evidence of increased intracranial pressure, or necessity for surgical resection or other therapy for subependymal giant-cell astrocytoma. Of the 16 patients for whom 24-hour video electroencephalography data were available, seizure frequency for the 6-month study period (vs. the previous 6-month period) decreased in 9, did not change in 6, and increased in 1 (median change, -1 seizure; P=0.02). The mean (+-SD) score on the validated Quality-of-Life in Childhood Epilepsy questionnaire (on which scores can range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating a better quality of life) was improved at 3 months (63.4+-12.4) and 6 months (62.1+-14.2) over the baseline score (57.8+-14.0). Single cases of grade 3 treatment-related sinusitis, pneumonia, viral bronchitis, tooth infection, stomatitis, and leukopenia were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Everolimus therapy was associated with marked reduction in the volume of subependymal giant-cell astrocytomas and seizure frequency and may be a potential alternative to neurosurgical resection in some cases, though long-term studies are needed.

These regulatory events at enhancers contribute to the specific gene expression programs that determine cell state and the potential for differentiation into new cell types. Although enhancer elements are known to be associated with certain histone modifications and transcription factors, the relationship of these modifications to gene expression and developmental state has not been clearly defined. Here we interrogate the epigenetic landscape of enhancer elements in embryonic stem cells and several adult tissues in the mouse. We find that histone H3K27ac distinguishes active enhancers from inactive/poised enhancer elements containing H3K4me1 alone. This indicates that the amount of actively used enhancers is lower than previously anticipated. Furthermore, poised enhancer networks provide clues to unrealized developmental programs. Finally, we show that enhancers are reset during nuclear reprogramming."

An increased prevalence of radiological vertebral fractures was recently observed in women with prolactin (PRL)-secreting adenoma, whereas it is unknown whether this observation may reflect a more general increased risk of fractures in this disease and whether the prevalence of fractures in males is affected by gonadal status. Thirty-two males (median age 47 years, range: 22-79) with PRL-secreting pituitary adenoma (10 with microadenoma and 22 with macroadenoma) and 64 control males, with normal PRL values and with comparable age to patients with hyperprolactinemia, were evaluated for vertebral fractures by a morphometric approach and for bone mineral density (BMD) by a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry at lumbar spine. Vertebral fractures were shown in 12 patients with PRL-secreting adenoma (37.5%) and in 5 controls (7.8%, P < 0.001). Fractured patients had lower BMD T-score (P = 0.007) and longer duration of disease (P < 0.001) as compared to patients who did not fracture. Fractures occurred more frequently (P = 0.03) in patients with untreated hyperprolactinemia versus patients treated with cabergoline whose frequency of vertebral fractures was still higher than control subjects. The prevalence of vertebral fractures was not significantly different between eugonadal and hypogonadal patients (33.3% vs. 38.5%; P = 0.8). Moreover, no significant (P = 0.4) difference in serum testosterone values was found between fractured and not fractured males. Hyperprolactinemia is associated with high prevalence of radiological vertebral fractures in men with PRL-secreting adenoma.

These experiments helped to define the specific role of transcription factors in conferring cell identity and played a key role in the development of the regenerative medicine field. We here investigated the acquisition of DNA methylation changes during C/EBPalpha-induced pre-B cell to macrophage transdifferentiation. Unexpectedly, cell lineage conversion occurred without significant changes in DNA methylation not only in key B cell- and macrophage-specific genes but also throughout the entire set of genes differentially methylated between the two parental cell types. In contrast, active and repressive histone modification marks changed according to the expression levels of these genes. We also demonstrated that C/EBPalpha and RNA Pol II are associated with the methylated promoters of macrophage-specific genes in reprogrammed macrophages without inducing methylation changes. Our findings not only provide insights about the extent and hierarchy of epigenetic events in pre-B cell to macrophage transdifferentiation but also show an important difference to reprogramming towards pluripotency where promoter DNA demethylation plays a pivotal role."

Although chromatin profiling has proven to be a powerful method for mapping regulatory sequences in cultured cells, chromatin states characteristic of active developmental enhancers have not been directly identified in embryonic tissues. Here we use whole-transcriptome analysis coupled with genome-wide profiling of H3K27ac and H3K27me3 to map chromatin states and enhancers in mouse embryonic forelimb and hindlimb. We show that gene-expression differences between forelimb and hindlimb, and between limb and other embryonic cell types, are correlated with tissue-specific H3K27ac signatures at promoters and distal sites. Using H3K27ac profiles, we identified 28,377 putative enhancers, many of which are likely to be limb specific based on strong enrichment near genes highly expressed in the limb and comparisons with tissue-specific EP300 sites and known enhancers. We describe a chromatin state signature associated with active developmental enhancers, defined by high levels of H3K27ac marking, nucleosome displacement, hypersensitivity to sonication, and strong depletion of H3K27me3. We also find that some developmental enhancers exhibit components of this signature, including hypersensitivity, H3K27ac enrichment, and H3K27me3 depletion, at lower levels in tissues in which they are not active. Our results establish histone modification profiling as a tool for developmental enhancer discovery, and suggest that enhancers maintain an open chromatin state in multiple embryonic tissues independent of their activity level."

Sometimes, uterine fibroids may be complicated by a variety of symptoms, including menstrual disturbance (e.g., menorrhagia, dysmenorrhea, intermenstrual bleeding), pressure symptoms, bloated sensation, increased urinary frequency, bowel disturbance, or pelvic pain; therefore definite treatment is requested. Hysterectomy may be the first choice for women who have completed their child-birth; however, many women may prefer to keep the uterus if the uterine fibroids-related symptoms can be appropriately controlled. Among these conservative therapies, myomectomy may be one of the most popular methods for the woman who would like to preserve her future fertility, as the majority of symptoms can be relieved by myomectomy; this contributes to the value of this review.

Tonic signaling through the BCR provides growth and signals to chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells, and plays an important role in the pathogenesis and progression of the disease. Antigen engagement of BCR is followed by intracellular recruitment and activation of BCR-associated kinases including spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk), Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3K). Inhibition of signaling pathways downstream of the BCR induces disruption of chemokine-mediated CLL cell migration and cell killing. BCR signal transduction inhibitors represent a promising new strategy for targeted CLL treatment. A number of therapeutic agents have recently been developed with significant activity in CLL. The compounds that are currently investigated in patients with CLL include ibrutinib -inhibitor of Btk, fostamatinib-inhibitor of Syk and idelalisib (GS-1101) -a specific isoform of the PI3K (PI3K) inhibitor. The clinical activity of ibrutinib, GS-1101 and fostamatinib in patients with CLL is associated with marked lymphocytosis due to release of tumor cells from the lymph nodes into the peripheral blood. Further studies are ongoing with single agents and their combinations with other targeted and conventional therapies. This article will review the preclinical rationale of BCR signaling inhibitors in the treatment of CLL, and the clinical evidence supporting the use of these agents in CLL patients. "

We studied the growth inhibitory effects of rucaparib in a panel of 39 ovarian cancer cell lines that were each characterized for mutation and methylation status of BRCA1/2, baseline gene expression signatures, copy number variations of selected genes, PTEN status, and sensitivity to platinum-based chemotherapy. To study interactions with chemotherapy, we used multiple drug effect analyses and assessed apoptosis, DNA fragmentation, and gammaH2AX formation. Concentration-dependent antiproliferative effects of rucaparib were seen in 26 of 39 (67%) cell lines and were not restricted to cell lines with BRCA1/2 mutations. Low expression of other genes involved in homologous repair (e.g., BCCIP, BRCC3, ATM, RAD51L1), amplification of AURKA or EMSY, and response to platinum-based chemotherapy was associated with sensitivity to rucaparib. Drug interactions with rucaparib were synergistic for topotecan, synergistic, or additive for carboplatin, doxorubicin or paclitaxel, and additive for gemcitabine. Synergy was most pronounced when rucaparib was combined with topotecan, which resulted in enhanced apoptosis, DNA fragmentation, and gammaH2AX formation. Importantly, rucaparib potentiated chemotherapy independent of its activity as a single agent. PARP inhibition may be a useful therapeutic strategy for a wider range of ovarian cancers bearing deficiencies in the homologous recombination pathway other than just BRCA1/2 mutations. These results support further clinical evaluation of rucaparib either as a single agent or as an adjunct to chemotherapy for the treatment of sporadic ovarian cancer."

Here, we investigated whether NLRP3 knockdown decreases neutrophil infiltration, reduces brain edema, and improves neurological function in an intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) mouse model. We also determined whether mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) governed by mitochondrial permeability transition pores (mPTPs) would trigger NLRP3 inflammasome activation following ICH. METHODS: ICH was induced by injecting autologous arterial blood (30mul) into a mouse brain. NLRP3 small interfering RNAs were administered 24 hours before ICH. A mPTP inhibitor (TRO-19622) or a specific mitochondria ROS scavenger (Mito-TEMPO) was coinjected with the blood. In naive animals, rotenone, which is a respiration chain complex I inhibitor, was applied to induce mitochondrial ROS production, and followed by TRO-19622 or Mito-TEMPO treatment. Neurological deficits, brain edema, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, Western blot, in vivo chemical cross-linking, ROS assay, and immunofluorescence were evaluated. RESULTS: ICH activated the NLRP3 inflammasome. NLRP3 knockdown reduced brain edema and decreased myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels at 24 hours, and improved neurological functions from 24 to 72 hours following ICH. TRO-19622 or Mito-TEMPO reduced ROS, NLRP3 inflammasome components, and MPO levels following ICH. In naive animals, rotenone administration induced mPTP formation, ROS generation, and NLRP3 inflammasome activation, which were then reduced by TRO-19622 or Mito-TEMPO. INTERPRETATION: The NLRP3 inflammasome amplified the inflammatory response by releasing IL-1beta and promoting neutrophil infiltration following ICH. Mitochondria ROS may be a major trigger of NLRP3 inflammasome activation. The results of our study suggest that the inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome may effectively reduce the inflammatory response following ICH.ANN NEUROL 2014;75:209-219."

Everolimus has demonstrated substantial clinical benefit in randomized, controlled, phase III studies leading to approval for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma, advanced neuroendocrine tumors of pancreatic origin, renal angiomyolipoma and subependymal giant-cell astrocytoma associated with tuberous sclerosis complex, as well as advanced hormone-receptor-positive (HR(+)) and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2-negative advanced breast cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We discuss clinically relevant everolimus-related adverse events from the phase III studies, including stomatitis, noninfectious pneumonitis, rash, selected metabolic abnormalities, and infections, with focus on appropriate clinical management of these events and specific considerations in patients with breast cancer. RESULTS: The majority of adverse events experienced during everolimus therapy are of mild to moderate severity. The safety profile and protocols for toxicity management are well established. The class-effect adverse event profile observed with everolimus plus endocrine therapy in breast cancer is (as expected) distinct from that of endocrine therapy alone, but is similar to that observed with everolimus in other solid tumors. Information gained from the experience in other carcinomas on prompt diagnosis and treatments to optimize drug exposure, treatment outcomes, and patients' quality of life also applies to the patient population with advanced breast cancer. CONCLUSIONS: As with all orally administered agents, education of both physicians and patients in the management of adverse events for patients receiving everolimus is critical to achieving optimal exposure and clinical benefit. Active monitoring for early identification of everolimus-related adverse events combined with aggressive and appropriate intervention should lead to a reduction in the severity and duration of the event."

Because of differences in patient demographics, epidemiology, and stroke risk management in East Asia, outcomes and relative effects of rivaroxaban versus warfarin were assessed to determine consistency among East Asians versus other ROCKET AF participants. METHODS: Baseline demographics and interaction of treatment effects of rivaroxaban and warfarin among patients within East Asia and outside were assessed. RESULTS: A total of 932 (6.5%) ROCKET AF participants resided in East Asia. At baseline, East Asians had lower weight, creatinine clearance, and prior vitamin K antagonist use; higher prevalence of prior stroke; and less congestive heart failure and prior myocardial infarction than other participants. Despite higher absolute event rates for efficacy and safety outcomes in East Asians, the relative efficacy of rivaroxaban (20 mg once daily; 15 mg once daily for creatinine clearance of 30-49 mL/min) versus warfarin with respect to the primary efficacy end point (stroke/systemic embolism) was consistent among East Asians and non-East Asians (interaction P=0.666). Relative event rates for the major or nonmajor clinically relevant bleeding in patients treated with rivaroxaban and warfarin were consistent among East Asians and non-East Asians (interaction P=0.867). CONCLUSIONS: Observed relative efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban versus warfarin were similar among patients within and outside East Asia. Rivaroxaban, 20 mg once daily, is an alternative to warfarin for stroke prevention in East Asians with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation."

Epigenetic programs may account for a significant fraction of the \"missing heritability.\" Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation and chromatin assembly states, reflect the high plasticity of the genome and contribute to stably alter gene expression without modifying genomic DNA sequences.

The knowledge acquired from epigenetic genome reprogramming during development, stem cell differentiation/de-differentiation, and model organisms is today shedding light on the mechanisms of (a) mitotic inheritance of epigenetic traits from cell to cell, (b) meiotic epigenetic inheritance from generation to generation, and (c) true transgenerational inheritance. Such mechanisms have been shown to include incomplete erasure of DNA methylation, parental effects, transmission of distinct RNA types (mRNA, non-coding RNA, miRNA, siRNA, piRNA), and persistence of subsets of histone marks.

Recent advances in epidemiology, imaging, and treatment have provided a better understanding of IIH in recent years, with better identification of visual risk factors and atypical forms of IIH, including fulminant IIH and spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid leaks, and a randomized clinical trial providing the rationale for the use of acetazolamide. In addition, a revised version of the modified Dandy criteria for the diagnosis of IIH was suggested in 2013, with better definition of IIH in adults and children; however, controversy regarding nomenclature has precluded its acceptance among IIH experts. Finally, questions regarding the best surgical strategy, the indications for venous sinus stenting, and the diagnostic role of the radiologic findings commonly seen in IIH have remained unanswered. "

It may show locally invasive behavior resulting in recurrence and malignancy. Therefore, appropriate diagnosis of this tumor is necessary. The aim of this study was to evaluate clinicopathological characteristics of ameloblastomas in an Iranian population. We present a 40-year retrospective study of patients diagnosed from 1971 to 2010 in the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology, Faculty of Dentistry, Mashhad, Iran. Information gathered from patient records included age, gender, tumor location and histologic type. The frequency of odontogenic tumors among all lesions was 2.08% and ameloblastoma with 88 samples demonstrated the greatest prevalence (41.5%). Regarding gender, 60% of samples occurred in males. The mean age of studied patients was 33.02+- 15.74 years with a peak of occurrence in the third decade of life. The most frequent location of tumor was the mandibles (93.2%). Eighty five (96.6%) tumors were recorded as benign and 3 (3.4%) as malignant. Of benign tumors, 62 (72.9%), 20 (23.5%) and 3 (3.6%) cases were of conventional, unicyctic and peripheral types, respectively. In contrast to most previous studies, the most common histologic subtype in the present study was plexiform. Knowledge of the incidence of ameloblastoma and its clinicopathologic features including most common location, gender and age distribution in different ethnogeographic backgrounds is necessary for accurate diagnosis and proper treatment.

The literature shows that about 30-40% of DMD subjects have intellectual disability. In males with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, neuropsychiatric disorders have also been observed: attention deficit disorder and hyperactivity, autism spectrum disorders, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Duchenne muscular dystrophy is not just a muscle disorder, but also a disease that affects the brain. The aim of the present study was to describe a case series of children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy that have also the presence of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). They have been assessed by means of standardized autism scales and the most appropriate psycho-educational treatment is herein discussed. METHODS: In order to evaluate and identify the presence and intensity of autistic symptoms have been used the Childhood Autism Rating Scale and Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule tools. Moreover, in order to assess the intelligence of subjects and their lower limb function, Wisch-R intelligence scale and Vignos function scale were used, respectively. RESULTS: Atypical behaviors included a preference for being alone, and selective interest in privileged objects used in a stereotyped manner, motor fretting, and attention instability were present in all children. By the administration of these scales was confirmed the presence of an autism spectrum disorders in all subjects.

To do so, DCs have to traverse many different tissues with varying oxygen tensions. Additionally, DCs are often exposed to low oxygen tensions in tumors, where vascularization is lacking, as well as in inflammatory foci, where oxygen is rapidly consumed by inflammatory cells during the respiratory burst. DCs respond to oxygen levels to tailor immune responses to such low-oxygen environments. In the present study, we identified a mechanism of hypoxia-mediated potentiation of release of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), a pro-inflammatory cytokine with important roles in both anti-cancer immunity and autoimmune disease. We show in human monocyte-derived DCs (moDCs) that this potentiation is controlled exclusively via the p38/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. We identified MAPK kinase kinase 8 (MAP3K8) as a target gene of hypoxia-induced factor (HIF), a transcription factor controlled by oxygen tension, upstream of the p38/MAPK pathway. Hypoxia increased expression of MAP3K8 concomitant with the potentiation of TNF-alpha secretion. This potentiation was no longer observed upon siRNA silencing of MAP3K8 or with a small molecule inhibitor of this kinase, and this also decreased p38/MAPK phosphorylation. However, expression of DC maturation markers CD83, CD86, and HLA-DR were not changed by hypoxia. Since DCs play an important role in controlling T-cell activation and differentiation, our results provide novel insight in understanding T-cell responses in inflammation, cancer, autoimmune disease and other diseases where hypoxia is involved."

Over the past 2 decades, multiple medications have been studied and approved for use in MS. Most of these agents work by modulating or suppressing the peripheral immune system. Siponimod is a newer-generation sphingosine 1 phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator that internalizes S1P1 receptors, thereby inhibiting efflux of lymphocytes from lymph nodes and thymus. There are promising data suggesting that it may also have a direct neuroprotective property independent of peripheral lymphocytopenia.Areas covered: We reviewed the pharmacology and the clinical and radiological effects of siponimod.Expert opinion: The selective effect of siponimod on the S1P1 and S1P5 receptors offers a favorable side-effect profile and transient bradycardia can be avoided by dose titration. A phase-II study showed that siponomod has dose-dependent beneficial effects in patients with relapsing remitting disease.

This viral coagulopathy may occur despite thromboprophylaxis and raises mortality; the risk appears highest among critically ill inpatients monitored in the intensive care unit. The prevalence of venous thromboembolism in COVID-19 patients has been reported to reach ~10-35%, while autopsies raise it to nearly 60%. The most common thrombotic complication is pulmonary embolism, which though may occur in the absence of a recognizable deep venous thrombosis and may be due to pulmonary arterial thrombosis rather than embolism, resulting in thrombotic occlusion of small- to mid-sized pulmonary arteries and subsequent infarction of lung parenchyma. This micro-thrombotic pattern seems more specific for COVID-19 and is associated with an intense immuno-inflammatory reaction that results in diffuse occlusive thrombotic micro-angiopathy with alveolar damage and vascular angiogenesis. Furthermore, thrombosis has also been observed in various arterial sites, including coronary, cerebral and peripheral arteries. Biomarkers related to coagulation, platelet activation and inflammation have been suggested as useful diagnostic and prognostic tools for COVID-19-associated coagulopathy; among them, D-dimer remains a key biomarker employed in clinical practice. Various medical societies have issued guidelines or consensus statements regarding thromboprophylaxis and treatment of these thrombotic complications specifically adapted to COVID-19 patients. All these issues are detailed in this review, data from meta-analyses and current guidelines are tabulated, while the relevant mechanisms of this virus-associated coagulopathy are pictorially illustrated."

The mechanisms of acquired resistance to these therapies are currently unknown. METHODS: Among patients with KRASG12C -mutant cancers treated with adagrasib monotherapy, we performed genomic and histologic analyses that compared pretreatment samples with those obtained after the development of resistance. Cell-based experiments were conducted to study mutations that confer resistance to KRASG12C inhibitors. RESULTS: A total of 38 patients were included in this study: 27 with non-small-cell lung cancer, 10 with colorectal cancer, and 1 with appendiceal cancer. Putative mechanisms of resistance to adagrasib were detected in 17 patients (45% of the cohort), of whom 7 (18% of the cohort) had multiple coincident mechanisms. Acquired KRAS alterations included G12D/R/V/W, G13D, Q61H, R68S, H95D/Q/R, Y96C, and high-level amplification of the KRASG12C allele. Acquired bypass mechanisms of resistance included MET amplification; activating mutations in NRAS, BRAF, MAP2K1, and RET; oncogenic fusions involving ALK, RET, BRAF, RAF1, and FGFR3; and loss-of-function mutations in NF1 and PTEN. In two of nine patients with lung adenocarcinoma for whom paired tissue-biopsy samples were available, histologic transformation to squamous-cell carcinoma was observed without identification of any other resistance mechanisms. Using an in vitro deep mutational scanning screen, we systematically defined the landscape of KRAS mutations that confer resistance to KRASG12C inhibitors. CONCLUSIONS: Diverse genomic and histologic mechanisms impart resistance to covalent KRASG12C inhibitors, and new therapeutic strategies are required to delay and overcome this drug resistance in patients with cancer.

From the first clinical description of afibrinogenemia in 1920, many major achievements have contributed to a better understanding of these complex disorders. The finding of causative mutations in all three fibrinogen genes has contributed to reveal the molecular mechanisms involved in biosynthesis of the fibrinogen molecule and to clarify the basic processes of fibrin polymerization and fibrinolysis. The compilation of abundant cases with detailed genetic, biological, and clinical features has enabled the classification of congenital fibrinogen disorders into several types and subtypes. Thus, the recent classification of congenital fibrinogen disorder is based not only on the clottable and antigenic fibrinogen levels but also on the patient's clinical phenotype and genotype. Fibrinogen supplementation is the cornerstone of bleeding management in fibrinogen disorders. Since the discovery of blood fractionation, the method of production of fibrinogen concentrate has been progressively modified to significantly improve purity and safety. Nevertheless, the availability of such products is still limited to a few countries and the optimal threshold of fibrinogen to target is still not established. In this review, we describe the major advances that have characterized 100 years of congenital fibrinogen disorders, focusing on afibrinogenemia and dysfibrinogenemia."

Sotorasib was the first-in-class KRAS inhibitor to reach the US and European market, and its pharmacological inhibition is restricted to the KRAS p.G12C mutation. Sotorasib showed activity (tumor shrinkage) in patients with non-small cell lung cancer harboring this specific mutation, and efficacy was tested in the CodeBreaK 200, open-label, phase 3 trial (NCT04303780). The results were presented in the ESMO 2022 meeting. CodeBreaK 200 found an improvement in the primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS), but overall survival, a key secondary endpoint, was not improved. However, critical questions about the trial's design may limit inferences regarding the reported results. The control arm treatment was inferior to the best standard of care. A late protocol modification (which lowered the sample size and allowed a problematic crossover) prohibited the trial from making a determination regarding overall survival. Imbalance in censoring rates, with potential informative censoring, makes PFS estimates unreliable. Quality-of-life data were also limited. Ultimately, CodeBreaK 200 does not clarify how this therapy should be used in practice, and while we maintain cautious enthusiasm for this and other Ras inhibitors, we await more informative trials."

Until recently, targeted therapies against KRAS G12C have been largely unsuccessful due to the small protein size of KRAS and thus lack of binding pockets in KRAS and rapid hydrolysis of GTP to GDP by KRAS enzymes from abundance of GTP in the cytoplasm.

Photofrin-II is the photosensitizer most actively being investigated. We labeled Photofrin-II with Indium-111 and studied the uptake and distribution of this agent in 20 patients with intracranial neoplasms, using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with volume rendering in three dimensions. Of these patients, 16 had malignant glial tumors, 2 had metastatic deposits, 1 had a chordoma, and 1 had a meningioma.

Depending on additional symptoms, WS is classified into four types: WS1, WS2, WS3 and WS4. Mutations in MITF (microphthalmia-associated transcription factor) and PAX3, encoding transcription factors, are responsible for WS2 and WS1/WS3, respectively. We have previously shown that MITF transactivates the gene for tyrosinase, a key enzyme for melanogenesis, and is critically involved in melanocyte differentiation. Absence of melanocytes affects pigmentation in the skin, hair and eyes, and hearing function in the cochlea. Therefore, hypopigmentation and hearing loss in WS2 are likely to be the results of an anomaly of melanocyte differentiation caused by MITF mutations. However, the molecular mechanism by which PAX3 mutations cause the auditory-pigmentary symptoms in WS1/WS3 remains to be explained. Here we show that PAX3, a transcription factor with a paired domain and a homeodomain, transactivates the MITF promoter. We further show that PAX3 proteins associated with WS1 in either the paired domain or the homeodomain fail to recognize and transactivate the MITF promoter. These results provide evidence that PAX3 directly regulates MITF and suggest that the failure of this regulation due to PAX3 mutations causes the auditory-pigmentary symptoms in at least some individuals with WS1."

Male (NZW x BXSB)F1 mice, carrying the BXSB Yaa gene, serve as a model for SLE-associated antiphospholipid syndrome. Using microsatellite markers in the NZW x (NZW x BXSB)F1 backcross male progeny, we mapped BXSB alleles contributing to the generation of anti-CL antibodies, platelet-binding antibodies, thrombocytopenia and myocardial infarction. Generation of each disease character was controlled by two major independently segregating dominant alleles, i.e. those on chromosomes (Chr.) 4 and 17 for anti-CL antibodies, Chr. 8 and 17 for both anti-platelet antibodies and thrombocytopenia and, to our surprise, Chr. 7 and 14 for myocardial infarction, and that a combination of the two alleles appeared to produce full expression of each character, as a complementary gene action. The alleles on Chr. 17 linked to the above three characters were all mapped in close proximity to the H-2 complex. Therefore, no single factor such as anti-CL antibodies can explain the pathogenesis of SLE-associated antiphospholipid syndrome. Rather, a combination of susceptibility alleles such as described here, along with additional modifying loci, i.e. BXSB Yaa and some from NZW, characterizes unique SLE features in male (NZW x BXSB) F1 mice.

The biological functions of KRIT1 are unknown. We have investigated KRIT1 expression in endothelial cells by using specific anti-KRIT1 antibodies. By both microscopy and coimmunoprecipitation, we show that KRIT1 colocalizes with microtubules. In interphase cells, KRIT1 is found along the length of microtubules. During metaphase, KRIT1 is located on spindle pole bodies and the mitotic spindle. During late phases of mitosis, KRIT1 localizes in a pattern indicative of association with microtubule plus ends. In anaphase, the plus ends of the interpolar microtubules show strong KRIT1 staining and, in late telophase, KRIT1 stains the midbody remnant most strongly; this is the site of cytokinesis where plus ends of microtubules from dividing cells overlap. These results establish that KRIT1 is a microtubule-associated protein; its location at plus ends in mitosis suggests a possible role in microtubule targeting. These findings, coupled with evidence of interaction of KRIT1 with Krev1 and integrin cytoplasmic domain-associated protein-1 alpha (ICAP1 alpha), suggest that KRIT1 may help determine endothelial cell shape and function in response to cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions by guiding cytoskeletal structure. We propose that the loss of this targeting function leads to abnormal endothelial tube formation, thereby explaining the mechanism of formation of cerebral cavernous malformation (CCM) lesions."

Evidence from a clinical pilot study.\nThe cardiovascular system is an important target for thyroid hormones. The present study evaluates the changes affecting thyroid hormone metabolism during and 6 days after coronary artery bypass and their relationship with the post-operative outcome of the patients. Thirty-three patients were enrolled in the study; their thyroid hormone profiles were determined at 13 sampling points during surgery and for 6 days afterwards. Serum total tri-iodothyronine (T3) and free T3 (FT3) concentrations decreased significantly after surgery (P<0.001) and they remained significantly low until the end of the study. Free thyroxine (FT4) and T4 declined significantly immediately after surgery (P<0.05 for FT4, P<0.001 for T4) but they returned to baseline values (24 h and 96 h post-surgery respectively). Serum reverse T3 increased remarkably 36 h after surgery (P<0.001) and remained significantly higher than the baseline value throughout the study. A relevant finding was that the days of post-operative hospitalization (10+/-3 days, means+/-S.D.) was inversely correlated with the slope of the recovery of T3 concentration (P<0.001) or with the area under the plasma curves of T3 (P=0.024, time range 72-144 h) and the FT3/FT4 ratio (P=0.037, time range 72-144 h) during the post-operative period. Our data suggest a prolonged reduction of T4 to T3 conversion in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and indicate that the recovery period is the most critical in the evaluation of a possibly successful approach for T3 substitutive therapy."

The authors developed a quantitative health status measure, the Hydrocephalus Outcome Questionnaire (HOQ), designed specifically for children with hydrocephalus, which can be completed by the children's parents. METHODS: The standardized steps in the development of a health status measure were followed. Item generation required involvement of health professionals and focus groups with parents of children with hydrocephalus. A comprehensive list of 165 unique health status items was thus generated. To streamline the list, questionnaires were sent to 69 sets of parents to solicit their opinions regarding the most important of these health issues, and the 51 most significant items were then selected to represent the following health domains: physical, social-emotional, and cognitive. In another cohort of 90 sets of parents, the 51-item questionnaire was then tested for reliability and construct validity against the following independent measures of specific components of health: Health Utilities Index, Wide Range Achievement Reading Test, Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaires, and Functional Independence Measure for Children. The HOQ took approximately 10 to 15 minutes for the parents to complete and demonstrated excellent test-retest reliability (0.93, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.88-0.96), interrater reliability (0.88, 95% CI 0.79-0.93), and internal consistency (Cronbach alpha 0.94). Pearson correlation testing demonstrated very good construct validity between domain scores and their respective independent measures. CONCLUSIONS: The HOQ for children with hydrocephalus demonstrated excellent reliability and validity properties. This tool will be valuable for a wide range of clinical research projects in pediatric hydrocephalus."

Two major areas of epigenetics-DNA methylation and histone modifications-are known to have profound effects on controlling gene expression. DNA methylation is involved in normal cellular control of expression, and aberrant hypermethylation can lead to silencing of tumor-suppressor genes in carcinogenesis. Histone modifications control the accessibility of the chromatin and transcriptional activities inside a cell. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNA molecules, approximately 22 nucleotides long that can negatively control their target gene expression posttranscriptionally. There are currently more than 460 human miRNAs known, and the total number is predicted to be much larger. Recently, the expression of miRNAs has been definitively linked to cancer development, and miRNA profiles can be used to classify human cancers. miRNAs are encoded in our genome and are generally transcribed by RNA polymerase II. Despite the growing evidence for their importance in normal physiology, little is known about the regulation of miRNA expression. In this review, we will examine the relationship between miRNAs and epigenetics. We examine the effects of miRNAs on epigenetic machinery, and the control of miRNA expression by epigenetic mechanisms.

DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis using a simulation model of HIV disease. The prevalence of HLA-B*5701 and the probabilities of confirmed and unconfirmed severe systemic hypersensitivity reaction among patients taking abacavir testing HLA-B*5701 positive and negative were from the Prospective Randomized Evaluation of DNA Screening in a Clinical Trial study. The monthly costs of abacavir-based and tenofovir-based regimens were $1135 and $1139, respectively; similar virologic efficacy was assumed and this assumption was varied in sensitivity analysis. PATIENTS: Simulated cohort of patients initiating HIV therapy. INTERVENTIONS: The interventions are first-line abacavir, lamivudine, and efavirenz without pretreatment HLA-B*5701 testing; the same regimen with HLA-B*5701 testing; and first-line tenofovir, emtricitabine, and efavirenz. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Quality-adjusted life years and lifetime medical costs discounted at 3% per annum, cost-effectiveness ratios ($/QALY). RESULTS: Abacavir-based treatment without HLA-B*5701 testing resulted in a projected 30.93 years life expectancy, 16.23 discounted quality-adjusted life years, and $472,200 discounted lifetime cost per person. HLA-B*5701 testing added 0.04 quality-adjusted months at an incremental cost of $110, resulting in a cost-effectiveness ratio of $36,700/QALY compared with no testing. Initiating treatment with a tenofovir-based regimen increased costs without improving quality-adjusted life expectancy. HLA-B*5701 testing remained the preferred strategy only if abacavir-based treatment had equal efficacy and cost less per month than tenofovir-based treatment. Results were also sensitive to the cost of HLA-B*5701 testing and the prevalence of HLA-B*5701. CONCLUSION: Pharmacogenetic testing for HLA-B*5701 is cost-effective only if abacavir-based treatment is as effective and costs less than tenofovir-based treatment."

This article presents a model of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance and explores the effect of epigenetic inheritance on the risk and recurrence risk of a complex disease. The model assumes that epigenetic modifications of the genome are gained and lost at specified rates and that each modification contributes multiplicatively to disease risk. The potentially high rate of loss of epigenetic modifications causes the probability of identity in state in close relatives to be smaller than is implied by their relatedness. As a consequence, the recurrence risk to close relatives is reduced. Although epigenetic modifications may contribute substantially to average risk, they will not contribute much to recurrence risk and heritability unless they persist on average for many generations. If they do persist for long times, they are equivalent to mutations and hence are likely to be in linkage disequilibrium with SNPs surveyed in genomewide association studies. Thus epigenetic modifications are a potential solution to the problem of missing causality of complex diseases but not to the problem of missing heritability. The model highlights the need for empirical estimates of the persistence times of heritable epialleles."

DNA methylation is one such heritable epigenetic change, which is causally associated with the transcription regulation of many genes in the mammalian genome. Altered DNA methylation has been implicated in a wide variety of human diseases including cancer. Understanding the regulation of DNA methylation is likely to improve the ability to diagnose and treat these diseases. With the advent of high-throughput RNA interference (RNAi) screens, answering epigenetic questions on a genomic scale is now possible. Two recent genome-wide RNAi screens have addressed the regulation of DNA methylation in cancer, leading to the identification of the regulators of epigenetic silencing by oncogenic RAS and how epigenetic silencing of the tumor suppressor RASSF1A is maintained. These RNAi screens have much wider applications, since similar screens can now be adapted to identify the mechanism of silencing of any human disease-associated gene that is epigenetically regulated. In this review, we discuss two recent genome-wide RNAi screens for epigenetic regulators and explore potential applications in understanding DNA methylation and gene expression regulation in mammalian cells. We also discuss some of the key unanswered questions in the field of DNA methylation and suggest genome-wide RNAi screens designed to answer them."

BTMX predicts the exposure status of known TM residues with an accuracy of 84.2% over 2,225 residues and provides a confidence score for all predictions. Predictions made are in concert with the fact that hydrophobic residues tend to be more exposed to the bilayer. The biological relevance of the input parameters is also discussed. The highest prediction accuracy is obtained when a sliding window comprising three residues with similar C(alpha)-C(beta) vector orientations is employed. The prediction accuracy of the BTMX method on a separate unseen non-redundant test dataset is 78.1%. By employing out-pointing residues that are exposed to the bilayer, we have identified various physico-chemical properties that show statistically significant differences between the beta strands located at the oligomeric interfaces compared to the non-oligomeric strands. The BTMX web server generates colored, annotated snake-plots as part of the prediction results and is available under the BTMX tab at http://service.bioinformatik.uni-saarland.de/tmx-site/.

Mutations in at least 14 different genes have been shown to cause FA, and several of these genes, including FANCJ/BRIP1, FANCD1/BRCA2 and FANCN/PALB2, also predispose to breast cancer in heterozygote carriers. The FA genes code for proteins that act in complexes to coordinate the repair of damaged DNA, and thus the FA repair network is intimately linked with hereditary breast cancer. Much remains to be learnt about the functions and interactions of the FA proteins and one experimental approach involves the generation of mice that are deficient in various FA genes.

Spliceosome assembly belongs to the key processes that enable splicing of mRNA and modulate alternative splicing. A detailed list of factors involved in spliceosomal reactions has been assorted over the past decade, but, their functional interplay is often unknown and most of the present biological models cover only parts of the complete assembly process. It is a challenging task to build a computational model that integrates dispersed knowledge and combines a multitude of reaction schemes proposed earlier.Because for most reactions involved in spliceosome assembly kinetic parameters are not available, we propose a discrete modeling using Petri nets, through which we are enabled to get insights into the system's behavior via computation of structural and dynamic properties. In this paper, we compile and examine reactions from experimental reports that contribute to a functional spliceosome. All these reactions form a network, which describes the inventory and conditions necessary to perform the splicing process. The analysis is mainly based on system invariants. Transition invariants (T-invariants) can be interpreted as signaling routes through the network. Due to the huge number of T-invariants that arise with increasing network size and complexity, maximal common transition sets (MCTS) and T-clusters were used for further analysis. Additionally, we introduce a false color map representation, which allows a quick survey of network modules and the visual detection of single reactions or reaction sequences, which participate in more than one signaling route. We designed a structured model of spliceosome assembly, which combines the demands on a platform that i) can display involved factors and concurrent processes, ii) offers the possibility to run computational methods for knowledge extraction, and iii) is successively extendable as new insights into spliceosome function are reported by experimental reports. The network consists of 161 transitions (reactions) and 140 places (reactants). All reactions are part of at least one of the 71 T-invariants. These T-invariants define pathways, which are in good agreement with the current knowledge and known hypotheses on reaction sequences during spliceosome assembly, hence contributing to a functional spliceosome. We demonstrate that present knowledge, in particular of the initial part of the assembly process, describes parallelism and interaction of signaling routes, which indicate functional redundancy and reflect the dependency of spliceosome assembly initiation on different cellular conditions. The complexity of the network is further increased by two switches, which introduce alternative routes during A-complex formation in early spliceosome assembly and upon transition from the B-complex to the C-complex. By compiling known reactions into a complete network, the combinatorial nature of invariant computation leads to pathways that have previously not been described as connected routes, although their constituents were known. T-clusters divide the network into modules, which we interpret as building blocks in spliceosome maturation. We conclude that Petri net representations of large biological networks and system invariants, are well-suited as a means for validating the integration of experimental knowledge into a consistent model. Based on this network model, the design of further experiments is facilitated."

However, for the same locus, some studies have yielded inconsistent results. To assess all the available evidence for association, we performed a meta-analysis on previously published case-control studies investigating the association between SNPs and RA. METHODS: Two hundred and sixteen studies, involving 125 SNPs, were reviewed. For each SNP, three genetic models were considered: the allele, dominant and recessive effects models. For each model, the effect summary odds ratio (OR) and 95% CIs were calculated. Cochran's Q-statistics were used to assess heterogeneity. If the heterogeneity was high, a random effects model was used for meta-analysis, otherwise a fixed effects model was used. RESULTS: The meta-analysis results showed that: (1) 30, 28 and 26 SNPs were significantly associated with RA (P<0.01) for the allele, dominant, and recessive models, respectively. (2) rs2476601 (PTPN22) showed the strongest association for all the three models: OR = 1.605, 95% CI: 1.540-1.672, P<1.00E-15 for the T-allele; OR = 1.638, 95% CI: 1.565-1.714, P<1.00E-15 for the T/T+T/C genotype and OR = 2.544, 95% CI: 2.173-2.978, P<1.00E-15 for the T/T genotype. (3) Only 23 (18.4%), 13 (10.4%) and 15 (12.0%) SNPs had high heterogeneity (P<0.01) for the three models, respectively. (4) For some of the SNPs, there was no publication bias according to Funnel plots and Egger's regression tests (P<0.01). For the other SNPs, the associations were tested in only a few studies, and may have been subject to publication bias. More studies on these loci are required. CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis provides a comprehensive evaluation of the RA association studies from the past two decades.

There are currently four known enzymatic PTMs of arginine (i.e., citrullination, methylation, phosphorylation, and ADP-ribosylation), and two non-enzymatic PTMs [i.e., carbonylation, advanced glycation end-products (AGEs)]. Enzymatic modification of arginine is tightly controlled during normal cellular function, and can be drastically altered in response to various second messengers and in different disease states. Non-enzymatic arginine modifications are associated with a loss of metabolite regulation during normal human aging. This abnormally large number of modifications to a single amino acid creates a diverse set of structural perturbations that can lead to altered biological responses. While the biological role of methylation has been the most extensively characterized of the arginine PTMs, recent advances have shown that the once obscure modification known as citrullination is involved in the onset and progression of inflammatory diseases and cancer. This review will highlight the reported arginine PTMs and their methods of detection, with a focus on new chemical methods to detect protein citrullination."

AIM: To evaluate whether quantification of glomerular filtration rate (GFR), proteinuria and kidney injury biomarkers can accurately predict the development of AKI. METHODS: A prospective cohort analysis of patients with cirrhosis was performed. Measures of baseline kidney function included serum creatinine, iohexol clearance and urine protein:creatinine ratio. Blood and urine samples were collected daily. A retrospective analysis of cystatin C GFR and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) measured 48 h prior to the diagnosis of AKI was undertaken to evaluate their ability to predict the development of AKI. RESULTS: Eighteen of the 34 cirrhosis patients studied developed AKI. A GFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) was identified in 56% with Iohexol clearance compared to 8% using the four-variable modified diet in renal disease formula (P < 0.0001). Prediction of AKI, 48 h prior to the development of AKI with cystatin C GFR and serum NGAL concentration were similar; area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) values 0.74 (0.51-0.97), P = 0.04 and 0.72 (0.52-0.92), P = 0.02 respectively.

While current therapies are mostly aimed at mitigating associated symptoms, novel therapies targeting the subcellular mechanisms underlying heart failure are emerging. Failing hearts are characterized by reduced contractile properties caused by impaired Ca(2+) cycling between the sarcoplasm and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). Sarcoplasmic/ endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)ATPase 2a (SERCA2a) mediates Ca(2+) reuptake into the SR in cardiomyocytes. Of note, the expression level and/or activity of SERCA2a, translating to the quantity of SR Ca(2+) uptake, are significantly reduced in failing hearts. Normalization of the SERCA2a expression level by gene delivery has been shown to restore hampered cardiac functions and ameliorate associated symptoms in pre-clinical as well as clinical studies. SERCA2a activity can be regulated at multiple levels of a signaling cascade comprised of phospholamban, protein phosphatase 1, inhibitor-1, and PKCalpha. SERCA2 activity is also regulated by post-translational modifications including SUMOylation and acetylation.

METHODS AND RESULTS: We investigated healthy control myocardium (n=5) and myocardium from patients with compensated hypertrophy (n=25) and HF (n=32). In hypertrophy, Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and protein kinase A (PKA) both phosphorylated RyR2 at levels that were not different from healthy myocardium. Accordingly, inhibitors of these kinases reduced the SR Ca(2+) leak. In HF, however, the SR Ca(2+) leak was nearly doubled compared with hypertrophy, which led to reduced systolic Ca(2+) transients, a depletion of SR Ca(2+) storage and elevated diastolic Ca(2+) levels. This was accompanied by a significantly increased CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation of RyR2. In contrast, PKA-dependent RyR2 phosphorylation was not increased in HF and was independent of previous beta-blocker treatment. In HF, CaMKII inhibition but not inhibition of PKA yielded a reduction of the SR Ca(2+) leak. Moreover, PKA inhibition further reduced SR Ca(2+) load and systolic Ca(2+) transients. CONCLUSIONS: In human hypertrophy, both CaMKII and PKA functionally regulate RyR2 and may induce SR Ca(2+) leak. In the transition from hypertrophy to HF, the diastolic Ca(2+) leak increases and disturbed Ca(2+) cycling occurs. This is associated with an increase in CaMKII- but not PKA-dependent RyR2 phosphorylation. CaMKII inhibition may thus reflect a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of arrhythmias and contractile dysfunction."

An update.\nAmeloblastoma is the most common odontogenic tumor of epithelial origin, and though it is of a benign nature, it frequently infiltrates the bone, has a high rate of recurrence and could potentially become malignant. Cellular adhesion potentially plays an important role in the manifestation of these characteristics and in the tumor biology of ameloblastomas. Losses of cell-cell and extracellular matrix adhesion and cohesion are among the first events that occur in the invasion and growth of tumors of epithelial origin. The present review includes a description of the molecules that are involved in cell adhesion as reported for various types of ameloblastomas and discusses the possible roles of these molecules in the biological behaviors of this odontogenic tumor. Knowledge of the complex mechanisms in which these molecules play a role is critical for the research and discovery of future therapeutic targets. "

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This multicenter prospective study, which was set in Toulouse and Lyon, France, included 60 patients (mean age, 48.9 +- 15.2 years) with neurogenic bladder and sphincter dysfunction. The correlation and the concordance with the inulin clearance of each method of renal function evaluation were assessed. RESULTS: The correlation of serum creatinine with inulin clearance was low when using serum creatinine-based equations such as the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (simplified and complete) and Cockcroft-Gault equations. The r and r(2) coefficients were higher for creatinine-based methods, such as 24-hour (r = 0.72) and 3-hour creatinine clearance (r = 0.78). The strongest correlation was found for serum cystatin C-based equations: the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) creatinine/cystatin C combined equation (r = 0.78) and the CKD-EPI cystatin C equation (r = 0.80). Mean bias of serum creatinine-based equations estimating glomerular filtration rate, the Cockcroft-Gault, and the simplified and complete Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equations, was 27.5 +- 28.6, 17.48 +- 29.40, and 21.98 +- 30.40 mL/min, respectively. Mean bias of creatinine clearance was 19.89 +- 15.30 mL/min at 3 hours and 19.00 +- 31.08 mL/min at 24 hours. Mean bias of the CKD-EPI cystatin C and the CKD-EPI creatinine/cystatin C combined equations was 11.98 +- 17.68 mL/min and 18.62 +- 17.85 mL/min, respectively. Limitations are the numerous types of neurologic diseases. CONCLUSION: The CKD-EPI equation using cystatin C was the most precise method of renal function evaluation in patients with neurogenic bladder."

Additionally, H3F3A K27M substitutions occur in gliomas that arise at midline locations (eg, pons, thalamus, spine); moreover, this substitution occurs mainly in tumors in children and adolescents. Here, we sought to determine the association between H3F3A mutations and adult thalamic glioma. METHODS: Genomic H3F3A was sequenced from 20 separate thalamic gliomas. Additionally, for 14 of the 20 gliomas, 639 genes--including cancer-related genes and chromatin-modifier genes--were sequenced, and the Infinium HumanMethylation450K BeadChip was used to examine DNA methylation across the genome. RESULTS: Of the 20 tumors, 18 were high-grade thalamic gliomas, and of these 18, 11 were from patients under 50 years of age (median age, 38 y; range, 17-46), and 7 were from patients over 50 years of age. The H3F3A K27M mutation was present in 10 of the 11 (91%) younger patients and absent from all 7 older patients. Additionally, H3F3A K27M was not detected in the 2 diffuse astrocytomas. Further sequencing revealed recurrent mutations in TP53, ATRX, NF1, and EGFR. Gliomas with H3F3A K27M from pediatric or young adult patients had similar, characteristic DNA methylation profiles. In contrast, thalamic gliomas with wild-type H3F3A had DNA methylation profiles similar to those of hemispheric glioblastomas. CONCLUSION: We found that high-grade thalamic gliomas from young adults, like those from children and adolescents, frequently had H3F3A K27M."

NIM-811 (N-metyl-4-isoleucine-cyclosporine) is a mitochondria specific drug, which can prevent ischemic-reperfusion (IR) injury, by inhibiting mitochondrial permeability transition pores (mPTP). OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to reduce damages in the skeletal muscle and the kidney after IR of the lower limb with NIM-811. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Wistar rats underwent 180 minutes of bilateral lower limb ischemia and 240 minutes of reperfusion. Four animal groups were formed called Sham (receiving vehicle and sham surgery), NIM-Sham (receiving NIM-811 and sham surgery), IR (receiving vehicle and surgery), and NIM-IR (receiving NIM-811 and surgery). Serum, urine and histological samples were taken at the end of reperfusion. NADH-tetrazolium staining, muscle Wet/Dry (W/D) ratio calculations, laser Doppler-flowmetry (LDF) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) monitoring were performed. Renal peroxynitrite concentration, serum TNF-alpha and IL-6 levels were measured. RESULTS: Less significant histopathological changes were observable in the NIM-IR group as compared with the IR group. Serum K+ and necroenzyme levels were significantly lower in the NIM-IR group than in the IR group (LDH: p<0.001; CK: p<0.001; K+: p = 0.017). Muscle mitochondrial viability proved to be significantly higher (p = 0.001) and renal function parameters were significantly better (creatinine: p = 0.016; FENa: p<0.001) in the NIM-IR group in comparison to the IR group. Serum TNF-alpha and IL-6 levels were significantly lower (TNF-alpha: p = 0.003, IL-6: p = 0.040) as well as W/D ratio and peroxynitrite concentration were significantly lower (p = 0.014; p<0.001) in the NIM-IR group than in the IR group. CONCLUSION: NIM-811 could have the potential of reducing rhabdomyolysis and impairment of the kidney after lower limb IR injury."

Despite several studies, the mechanism of CCM lesion onset remains unclear. Using a Ccm1 knockout mouse model, we studied the morphogenesis of early lesion formation in the retina in order to provide insight into potential mechanisms. We demonstrate that lesions develop in a stereotypic location and pattern, preceded by endothelial hypersprouting as confirmed in a zebrafish model of disease. The vascular defects seen with loss of Ccm1 suggest a defect in endothelial flow response. Taken together, these results suggest new mechanisms of early CCM disease pathogenesis and provide a framework for further study. "

The Phase III ROCKET AF (Rivaroxaban Once-Daily Oral Direct Factor Xa Inhibition Compared with Vitamin K Antagonism for Prevention of Stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation) trial showed that rivaroxaban, an oral, direct Factor Xa inhibitor, was noninferior to warfarin for the reduction of stroke or systemic embolism in patients with AF. Compared with warfarin, rivaroxaban significantly reduced rates of intracranial and fatal hemorrhages, although not rates of bleeding overall. XANTUS (Xarelto( ) for Prevention of Stroke in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation) is a prospective, international, observational, postauthorization, noninterventional study designed to collect safety and efficacy data on the use of rivaroxaban for stroke prevention in AF in routine clinical practice. The key goal is to determine whether the safety profile of rivaroxaban established in ROCKET AF is also observed in routine clinical practice. XANTUS is designed as a single-arm cohort study to minimize selection bias, and will enroll approximately 6,000 patients (mostly from Europe) with nonvalvular AF prescribed rivaroxaban, irrespective of their level of stroke risk. Overall duration of follow-up will be 1 year; the first patient was enrolled in June 2012. Similar studies (XANTUS-EL [Xarelto( ) for Prevention of Stroke in Patients with Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation, Eastern Europe, Middle East, Africa and Latin America] and XANAP [Xarelto( ) for Prevention of Stroke in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation in Asia-Pacific]) are ongoing in Latin America and Asia-Pacific. Data from these studies will supplement those from ROCKET AF and provide practical information concerning the use of rivaroxaban for stroke prevention in AF. "

        "text": "Tolerability of selective cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors used for the treatment of rheumatological manifestations of inflammatory bowel disease.\nBACKGROUND: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are used to reduce inflammatory pain and swelling in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients with rheumatological manifestations. While these drugs effectively reduce musculoskeletal pain and stiffness, long-term use is limited by gastrointestinal (GI) adverse effects (AEs) and disease exacerbation. As an alternative to NSAIDs, selective cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) inhibitors were developed to improve GI safety and tolerability. COX-2 inhibitors include drugs such as celecoxib, rofecoxib, valdecoxib, etoricoxib, and lumiracoxib. Rofecoxib and valdecoxib have been withdrawn from the market worldwide due to safety concerns (most importantly for cardiovascular adverse events) and lumiracoxib has been withdrawn in many countries due to liver toxicity. However, celecoxib and etoricoxib continue to be available for use in many countries. Several studies have examined whether COX-2 inhibitors can be safely used for the treatment of rheumatological manifestations of IBD with inconsistent results. Some investigators report acceptable safety profiles associated with these drugs while others found that COX-2 inhibitors are associated with high rates of disease exacerbation. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the tolerability and safety of COX-2 inhibitors used for the treatment of rheumatological manifestations of IBD. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the following databases from inception to 19 September 2013: PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE and CENTRAL. The search was not limited by language. Additional trials were identified by manually searching the reference lists of relevant papers and conference proceedings and through correspondence with experts and pharmaceutical companies. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared COX-2 inhibitors to placebo were considered for inclusion. Participants were adult patients with IBD presenting with rheumatological manifestations of at least two weeks duration. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed trial eligibility and extracted data. Methodological quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The primary outcome measure was the proportion of patients with disease exacerbation as defined by the included studies. Secondary outcomes included GI adverse effects, renal toxicity, cardiovascular and thrombotic events. Data were analysed on an intention-to-treat basis where patients with missing final outcomes were assumed to have had an exacerbation of IBD. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for dichotomous outcomes. The overall quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE criteria. MAIN RESULTS: There were no RCTs that assessed the tolerability or safety of the withdrawn COX-2 inhibitors rofecoxib, valdecoxib, or lumiracoxib. Two RCTs (n = 381 IBD patients with rheumatological manifestations) were included in the review. One study (n = 159) compared etoricoxib (60 to 120 mg/day) to placebo in IBD patients with quiescent or active ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. The other study (n = 222) compared celecoxib (200 mg twice daily) to placebo in patients with quiescent ulcerative colitis. Both studies were judged to be at low risk of bias. The two included studies were not pooled for meta-analysis due to differences in patient populations and treatment duration. There was no statistically significant difference in exacerbation of IBD between etoricoxib and placebo. After 12 weeks of treatment the IBD exacerbation rate was 17% (14/82) in the etoricoxib group compared to 19% (15/77) in the placebo group (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.69). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence supporting this outcome was low due to very sparse data (29 events). There was no statistically significant difference in exacerbation of ulcerative colitis between celecoxib and placebo. After two weeks of treatment 4% (5/112) of celecoxib patients experienced an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis compared to 6% (7/110) of patients in the placebo group (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.23 to 2.14). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence supporting this outcome was low due to very sparse data (12 events). The study comparing etoricoxib to placebo documented but did not report on AEs. The proportion of patients who experienced AEs was similar in the celecoxib and placebo groups (21% and 17%, respectively, P > 0.20). No patients in either group died or experienced serious adverse events. Eleven percent of patients in the celecoxib and placebo groups experienced GI AEs (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.46 to 2.07). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence supporting this outcome was low due to very sparse data (24 events). GI AEs led to premature withdrawal from the study in 3% of patients in celecoxib and placebo groups respectively. GI AEs included increased stool frequency, rectal bleeding, and inflamed mucosa. No patients experienced any cardiovascular adverse events. Renal toxicity or thrombotic AEs were not reported. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The results for disease exacerbation and AEs between the COX-2 inhibitors celecoxib and etoricoxib and placebo were uncertain. Thus no definitive conclusions regarding the tolerability and safety of the short term use of celecoxib and etoricoxib in patients with IBD can be drawn. The two included studies suggest that celecoxib and etoricoxib do not exacerbate IBD symptoms. However, it should be noted that both studies had relatively small sample sizes and short follow-up durations. Clinicians need to continue to weigh the risks and benefits of these drugs when treating patients IBD patients with rheumatological manifestations in order to avoid disease exacerbation and other adverse effects. Further RCTs are needed to determine the tolerability and safety of celecoxib and etoricoxib in these patients."

        "text": "Mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase activity protects against lipopolysaccharide-induced cardiac dysfunction in rats.\nMyocardial dysfunction in sepsis is associated with an increased risk of mortality. The mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2) enzyme is crucial for protecting the heart from ischemic injury. The aim of the present study was to determine the role of ALDH2 in cardiac dysfunction induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Male rats were treated intraperitoneally with LPS, and their stroke volume and cardiac output were evaluated using an M-mode echocardiograph. The expression levels and activity of ALDH2, nitric oxide content and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) activity, and the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) were also evaluated. Treatment with LPS (5, 10, or 20 mg/kg) resulted in a steady decrease in cardiac output and stroke volume. The ALDH2 activity was decreased in a dose-dependent manner; however, the ALDH2 protein expression levels remained unchanged. Alda-1, a specific activator of ALDH2, increased the activity of ALDH2 and lessened LPS-induced cardiac dysfunction. A marked opening of the MPTP was observed 12 h following treatment with LPS, which was prevented by Alda-1. The improvement in cardiac function in response to treatment with Alda-1, was partially prevented by treatment with the MPTP inhibitor atractyloside. LPS treatment induced an increase in iNOS activation and inhibition of ALDH2 activity. The iNOS selective inhibitor, aminoguanidine, partially reversed the LPS-induced ALDH2 activity decrease and MPTP opening. These results indicate that ALDH2 activity may have a role in protecting against LPS-induced cardiac dysfunction. The potential mechanism may involve inhibition of MPTP opening and iNOS expression."

The primary composite outcome was survival, tracheotomy or >23 h non-invasive ventilation (NIV). Secondary outcomes were ALSFRS-R, slow vital capacity (sVC) and quality of life (ALSAQ-40) decline. Tolerability was evaluated analysing adverse events (AEs) causing withdrawal. The randomisation sequence was computer-generated by blocks, stratified by centre, disease severity (ALSFRS-R cut-off score of 33) and onset (spinal or bulbar). The main outcome analysis was performed in all randomised patients and by intention-to-treat for the entire population and patients stratified by severity and onset. The study is registered, EudraCT 2009-016066-91. RESULTS: We randomly assigned 208 patients, of whom 5 (1 rhEPO and 4 placebo) withdrew consent and 3 (placebo) became ineligible (retinal thrombosis, respiratory insufficiency, SOD1 mutation) before receiving treatment; 103 receiving rhEPO and 97 placebo were eligible for analysis.

METHODS: In this randomized, controlled, phase 3 study, we assigned 834 patients with advanced melanoma in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive pembrolizumab (at a dose of 10 mg per kilogram of body weight) every 2 weeks or every 3 weeks or four doses of ipilimumab (at 3 mg per kilogram) every 3 weeks. Primary end points were progression-free and overall survival. RESULTS: The estimated 6-month progression-free-survival rates were 47.3% for pembrolizumab every 2 weeks, 46.4% for pembrolizumab every 3 weeks, and 26.5% for ipilimumab (hazard ratio for disease progression, 0.58; P<0.001 for both pembrolizumab regimens versus ipilimumab; 95% confidence intervals [CIs], 0.46 to 0.72 and 0.47 to 0.72, respectively). Estimated 12-month survival rates were 74.1%, 68.4%, and 58.2%, respectively (hazard ratio for death for pembrolizumab every 2 weeks, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.47 to 0.83; P=0.0005; hazard ratio for pembrolizumab every 3 weeks, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.90; P=0.0036). The response rate was improved with pembrolizumab administered every 2 weeks (33.7%) and every 3 weeks (32.9%), as compared with ipilimumab (11.9%) (P<0.001 for both comparisons). Responses were ongoing in 89.4%, 96.7%, and 87.9% of patients, respectively, after a median follow-up of 7.9 months. Efficacy was similar in the two pembrolizumab groups.

Rucaparib induces synthetic lethality in cancer cells defective in the homologous recombination repair pathway including BRCA-1/2. We investigated the efficacy and safety of single-agent rucaparib in germline (g) BRCA mutation carriers with advanced breast and ovarian cancers. METHODS: Phase II, open-label, multicentre trial of rucaparib in proven BRCA-1/2 mutation carriers with advanced breast and or ovarian cancer, WHO PS 0-1 and normal organ function. Intravenous (i.v.) and subsequently oral rucaparib were assessed, using a range of dosing schedules, to determine the safety, tolerability, dose-limiting toxic effects and pharmacodynamic (PD) and pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles. RESULTS: Rucaparib was well tolerated in patients up to doses of 480 mg per day and is a potent inhibitor of PARP, with sustained inhibition >=24 h after single doses. The i.v. rucaparib (intermittent dosing schedule) resulted in an objective response rate (ORR) of only 2% but with 41% (18 out of 44) patients achieved stable disease for >=12 weeks and 3 patients maintaining disease stabilisation for >52 weeks. The ORR for oral rucaparib (across all six dose levels) was 15%. In the oral cohorts, 81% (22 out of 27) of the patients had ovarian cancer and 12 out of 13, who were dosed continuously, achieved RECIST complete response/partial response (CR/PR) or stable disease (SD) >=12 weeks, with a median duration of response of 179 days (range 84-567 days). CONCLUSIONS: Rucaparib is well tolerated and results in high levels of PARP inhibition in surrogate tissues even at the lowest dose levels. Rucaparib is active in gBRCA-mutant ovarian cancer and this activity correlates with platinum-free interval. The key lessons learned from this study is that continuous rucaparib dosing is required for optimal response, the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for continuous oral scheduling has not been established and requires further exploration and, thirdly, the use of a PD biomarker to evaluate dose-response has its limitations."

The GTEx database were used to assess gene expression quantitative trait loci and mRNA expression of candidate genes and genes neighboring single nucleotide polymorphisms was analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR. RESULTS: In contrast to the Fank1-knockdown model, no significant changes in epididymal sperm content and the number of apoptotic cells were observed in Fank1-/- homozygotes. In addition, a different pattern of Dusp1, Klk1b21 and Klk1b27 mRNA expression was detected in Fank1-knockout testis. These results reveal differences in the molecular changes between Fank1-knockdown mice and Fank1-knockout mice and provide a basic resource for population genetics studies."

Methods: In this retrospective single-center study, we included 117 cases confirmed with COVID-19. The clinical, laboratory, and imaging features were collected and analyzed during admission. The Multi-lobular infiltration, hypo-Lymphocytosis, Bacterial coinfection, Smoking history, hyper-Tension and Age (MuLBSTA) Score and Confusion, Urea, Respiratory rate, Blood pressure, Age 65 (CURB65) score were used to assess the death and intensive care unit (ICU) risks in all patients. Results: Among of all 117 hospitalized patients, 21 (17.9%) patients were admitted to the ICU care, and 5 (4.3%) patients were died. The median hospital stay was 12 (10-15) days. There were 18 patients with MuLBSTA score >= 12 points and were all of severe type. In severe type, ICU care and death patients, the proportion with MuLBSTA >= 12 points were greater than that of CURB65 score >= 3 points (severe type patients, 50 vs. 27.8%; ICU care, 61.9 vs. 19.0%; death, 100 vs. 40%). For the MuLBSTA score, the ROC curve showed good efficiency of diagnosis death (area under the curve [AUC], 0.956; cutoff value, 12; specificity, 89.5%; sensitivity, 100%) and ICU care (AUC, 0.875; cutoff value, 11; specificity, 91.7%; sensitivity, 71.4%). The K-M survival analysis showed that patients with MuLBSTA score >= 12 had higher risk of ICU (log-rank, P = 0.001) and high risk of death (log-rank, P = 0.000). Conclusions: The MuLBSTA score is valuable for risk stratification and could effectively screen high-risk patients at admission. The higher score at admission have higher risk of ICU care and death in patients infected with COVID."

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between May 1992 and November 1993, 23 patients with malignant brain tumors were treated in Munster with IORT. The patient collective was heterogeneous and negatively selected, i.e. beside of primary treatments, also patients with extensive previous treatment, recurrent tumors or metastases were included. Therapy consisted of radical surgical resection and intraoperative electron radiotherapy using total doses from 15 Gy to 25 Gy relative to the 90% isodose. Afterwards, patients without prior treatment underwent percutaneous irradiation with a maximum dose of 60 Gy, related to the small volume of the tumor area plus a safety margin of 2 cm. RESULTS: No increase of peri-operative morbidity or subacute sequelae was observed. Overall 1-year survival was 67% for grade III gliomas (WHO), and 56% for glioblastoma multiforme. When the Matsutani selection criteria (primary therapy of a supratentorial, peripheral astrocytoma grade III or glioblastoma smaller than 5 cm in diameter with a Karnofsky performance index of more than 60% and possible wide resection) were applied, 1-year survival increased to 75%. Nuclear medical diagnostics using 123I-alpha-methyltyrosin SPECT proved a valuable method for imaging of non-resectable tumor tissue and diagnosis of recurrences. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that IORT can contribute to successful tumor treatment while neither increasing peri-operative morbidity nor subacute sequelae."

Patients suffer from syncopal attacks often resulting in sudden cardiac death. The main diagnostic parameter is a prolonged QT(c) interval as judged by electro-cardiographic investigation. LQTS is a genetically heterogeneous disease with four loci having been identified to date: chromosome 11p15.5 (LQT1), 7q35-36 (LQT2), 3p21-24 (LQT3) and 4q25-26 (LQT4). The corresponding genes code for potassium channels KVLQT1 (LQT1) and HERG (LQT2) and the sodium channel SCN5A (LQT3). The KVLQT1 gene is characterized by six transmembrane domains (S1-S6), a pore region situated between the S5 and S6 domains and a C-terminal domain accounting for approximately 60% of the channel. This domain is thought to be co-associated with another protein, viz. minK (minimal potassium channel). We have studied a Romano Ward family with several affected individuals showing a severe LQTS phenotype (syncopes and occurrence of sudden death). Most affected individuals had considerable prolongations of QT(c). By using haplotyping with a set of markers covering the four LQT loci, strong linkage was established to the LQT1 locus, whereas the other loci (LQT2, LQT3 and LQT4) could be excluded. Single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and direct sequencing were used to screen the KVLQT1 gene for mutations in the S1-S6 region, including the pore domain. We identified a Gly-216-Arg substitution in the S6 transmembrane domain of KVLQT1. The mutation was present in all affected family members but absent in normal control individuals, providing evidence that the mutated KVLQT1-gene product indeed caused LQTS in this family. The mutated KVLQT1-gene product thus probably results in a dominant negative suppression of channel activity."

In general, piebaldism has been distinguished from vitiligo by the presence of lesions from birth, the hyperpigmented macules of depigmented and normal skin, and the static course. We hypothesized that an 8-year-old girl and her mother who had unusual piebaldism of a progressive nature would have a novel mutation of the KIT gene, the gene that is altered in patients with piebaldism, or of the MITF (microphthalmia activating transcription factor) gene, which would be expected to cause type II Waardenburg syndrome, but is associated with a phenotype of progressive depigmentation in mice. Genomic DNA was extracted from the blood of affected and unaffected family members, and the KIT and MITF genes were sequenced. Genetic analysis of genomic DNA from both the mother and daughter with progressive piebaldism revealed a novel Val620Ala (1859T>C) mutation in the KIT gene, which was not detected in family members without progressive piebaldism or in 52 normal control individuals. This KIT mutation affects the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain and thus predicts a severe phenotype, as was the case in this family. Although other KIT mutations in the vicinity of codon 620 lead to the standard phenotype of static piebaldism, the Val620Ala mutation is novel and may result in a previously undescribed phenotype with melanocyte instability, leading to progressive loss of pigmentation as well as the progressive appearance of the hyperpigmented macules."

Clinical studies suggest that the strength of this acute response is important in early and late clinical outcomes, early clinical worsening, and extent of brain damage. Variables that are predictors of adverse stroke outcome include erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6, tumour necrosis factor-alpha and intercellular adhesion molecule-1. Current data indicate that inflammation serves to fuel atherosclerosis and can act as the link between atherosclerosis and atherothrombosis. Growing evidence indicates that platelets act as prominent players in the inflammatory component of these disease processes. Thus, upon activation, platelets release a series of cytokines and growth factors and express CD40 ligand, which interacts with the CD40 receptor on other major cell types involved in atherosclerosis/atherothrombosis. In healthy volunteers, CD40L expression in platelets is not significantly inhibited by acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) alone, but is inhibited after treatment with the ADP-receptor antagonist clopidogrel or with clopidogrel plus ASA. Of a range of potential inflammatory biomarkers that have been reported in the literature, the best studied is CRP. Such biomarkers may have clinical utility for refined identification of patients at high risk for atherothrombosis in different arterial beds and for monitoring of therapeutic agents in clinical trials."

Its absence leads to increased fork stalling and breakage at over 1,000 specific sites located throughout the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome. To understand the mechanisms that respond to and repair rrm3-dependent lesions, we carried out a candidate gene deletion analysis to identify genes whose mutation conferred slow growth or lethality on rrm3 cells. Based on synthetic phenotypes, the intra-S-phase checkpoint, the SRS2 inhibitor of recombination, the SGS1/TOP3 replication fork restart pathway, and the MRE11/RAD50/XRS2 (MRX) complex were critical for viability of rrm3 cells. DNA damage checkpoint and homologous recombination genes were important for normal growth of rrm3 cells. However, the MUS81/MMS4 replication fork restart pathway did not affect growth of rrm3 cells. These data suggest a model in which the stalled and broken forks generated in rrm3 cells activate a checkpoint response that provides time for fork repair and restart. Stalled forks are converted by a Rad51p-mediated process to intermediates that are resolved by Sgs1p/Top3p. The rrm3 system provides a unique opportunity to learn the fate of forks whose progress is impaired by natural impediments rather than by exogenous DNA damage."

However, its molecular target and mechanism of antiproliferative activity are not clear. Here, we identified curcumin as a novel antimicrotubule agent. We have examined the effects of curcumin on cellular microtubules and on reconstituted microtubules in vitro. Curcumin inhibited HeLa and MCF-7 cell proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner with IC(50) of 13.8 +/- 0.7 microm and 12 +/- 0.6 microm, respectively. At higher inhibitory concentrations (> 10 microm), curcumin induced significant depolymerization of interphase microtubules and mitotic spindle microtubules of HeLa and MCF-7 cells. However, at low inhibitory concentrations there were minimal effects on cellular microtubules. It disrupted microtubule assembly in vitro, reduced GTPase activity, and induced tubulin aggregation. Curcumin bound to tubulin at a single site with a dissociation constant of 2.4 +/- 0.4 microm and the binding of curcumin to tubulin induced conformational changes in tubulin. Colchicine and podophyllotoxin partly inhibited the binding of curcumin to tubulin, while vinblastine had no effect on the curcumin-tubulin interactions. The data together suggested that curcumin may inhibit cancer cells proliferation by perturbing microtubule assembly dynamics and may be used to develop efficacious curcumin analogues for cancer chemotherapy."

These proteins perform critical functions, including active ion-transport and passive nutrient intake. Therefore, there is a need for accurate prediction of secondary and tertiary structure of TMB proteins. Traditional homology modeling methods, however, fail on most TMB proteins since very few non-homologous TMB structures have been determined. Yet, because TMB structures conform to specific construction rules that restrict the conformational space drastically, it should be possible for methods that do not depend on target-template homology to be applied successfully. RESULTS: We develop a suite (TMBpro) of specialized predictors for predicting secondary structure (TMBpro-SS), beta-contacts (TMBpro-CON) and tertiary structure (TMBpro-3D) of transmembrane beta-barrel proteins. We compare our results to the recent state-of-the-art predictors transFold and PRED-TMBB using their respective benchmark datasets, and leave-one-out cross-validation. Using the transFold dataset TMBpro predicts secondary structure with per-residue accuracy (Q(2)) of 77.8%, a correlation coefficient of 0.54, and TMBpro predicts beta-contacts with precision of 0.65 and recall of 0.67. Using the PRED-TMBB dataset, TMBpro predicts secondary structure with Q(2) of 88.3% and a correlation coefficient of 0.75. All of these performance results exceed previously published results by 4% or more. Working with the PRED-TMBB dataset, TMBpro predicts the tertiary structure of transmembrane segments with RMSD <6.0 A for 9 of 14 proteins.

The molecular mechanism of the adjuvanticity of cationic liposome was studied and described in the current report. First, cationic DOTAP liposome, but not the neutral liposome DOPC, was shown to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) in mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDC). ROS generation by DOTAP was required for ERK and p38 activation and downstream chemokine/cytokine induction. Furthermore, ROS were shown to be involved in the expression of the co-stimulatory molecules CD86/CD80 induced by DOTAP. However, as the DOTAP concentration increased from 50 to 800 microM, the apoptotic marker Annexin V and ROS double positive cells increased, suggesting that high dose of DOTAP-generated ROS causes cell apoptosis. In vivo, optimal amount of ROS in the draining lymph nodes (DLN) and anti-tumor (HPV positive TC-1 tumor) activity induced by E7 peptide (antigen derived from E7 oncoprotein of human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16) formulated in 100 nmol DOTAP were attenuated by incorporating DOPC in the formulation, suggesting that ROS are essential for the vaccine induced anti-tumor activity. Moreover, 600 nmol DOTAP/E7 generated huge amount of ROS in the DLN and showed no activity of tumor regression. Interestingly, 600 nmol DOTAP/E7-induced ROS were tuned down to the same level induced by 100 nmol DOTAP/E7 by adding DOPC in the formulation and this formulation showed tumor regression activity. In conclusion, DOTAP is an active DC stimulator resulting in the activation of ERK and p38 and induction of chemokines, cytokines and co-stimulatory molecules mediated by appropriate amount of ROS. Our data elucidated an important mechanism of adjuvant activity of cationic liposome and could facilitate rational design of synthetic lipid based adjuvants and vaccine formulation."

This is a chronic, progressive condition usually affecting young male smokers and is characterized by giant emphysematous bullae, which commonly develop in the upper lobes. Extensive paraseptal emphysema coalesces to form giant bullae, compressing the normal lung parenchyma and often displacing it centrally. These bullae occupy at least one-third of a hemithorax. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seven patients with chest radiographic evidence of a bulla or bullae occupying at least one-third of a hemithorax, who had also been examined with high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT), were included in this retrospective study. On HRCT scans, the size, location, and distribution of the bullae were documented and categorized as either subpleural or central. RESULTS: The HRCT scan findings in all 7 study patients included numerous bullae ranging in size from a few centimeters in diameter to giant bullae nearly filling an entire hemithorax, mimicking a pneumothorax. Five of the 7 patients had extensive upper lobe predominant bullae, 4 of the 7 patients showed severe bilateral disease with asymmetric involvement, 2 of the 7 patients demonstrated left lung predominance and whereas 1 patient showed right lung predominant disease. All of our patients had subpleural bullae, had parenchymal fibrosis, another had extensive subcutaneous emphysema, and 1 had accompanying bronchiectasis. CONCLUSIONS: The predominant findings on HRCT scans are extensive paraseptal emphysema coalescing into giant bullae. HRCT is helpful in confirming the diagnosis of VLS, assessing the degree of the disease, and providing information to guide treatment."

We hypothesized that CaMKII contributes to arrhythmias and underlying cellular events and that inhibition of CaMKII reduces cardiac arrhythmogenesis in vitro and in vivo. METHODS AND RESULTS: Under baseline conditions, isolated cardiac myocytes from TG mice showed an increased incidence of early afterdepolarizations compared with wild-type myocytes (P<0.05). CaMKII inhibition (AIP) completely abolished these afterdepolarizations in TG cells (P<0.05). Increasing intracellular Ca stores using ISO (10(-8) M) induced a larger amount of delayed afterdepolarizations and spontaneous action potentials in TG compared with wild-type cells (P<0.05). This seems to be due to an increased sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca leak because diastolic [Ca](i) rose clearly on ISO in TG but not in wild-type cells (+20+/-5% versus +3+/-4% at 10(-6) M ISO, P<0.05). In parallel, SR Ca leak assessed by spontaneous SR Ca release events showed an increased Ca spark frequency (3.9+/-0.5 versus 2.0+/-0.4 sparks per 100 microm(-1).s(-1), P<0.05). However, CaMKII inhibition (either pharmacologically using KN-93 or genetically using an isoform-specific CaMKIIdelta-knockout mouse model) significantly reduced SR Ca spark frequency, although this rather increased SR Ca content. In parallel, ISO increased the incidence of early (54% versus 4%, P<0.05) and late (86% versus 43%, P<0.05) nonstimulated events in TG versus wild-type myocytes, but CaMKII inhibition (KN-93 and KO) reduced these proarrhythmogenic events (P<0.05). In addition, CaMKII inhibition in TG mice (KN-93) clearly reduced ISO-induced arrhythmias in vivo (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that CaMKII contributes to cardiac arrhythmogenesis in TG CaMKIIdelta(C) mice having heart failure and suggest the increased SR Ca leak as an important mechanism. Moreover, CaMKII inhibition reduces cardiac arrhythmias in vitro and in vivo and may therefore indicate a potential role for future antiarrhythmic therapies warranting further studies."

Prevention of intracellular Ca(2+) release by ryanodine or global cellular CaMKII inhibition reduced EADs and improved cell survival to control levels in WT beta(2a)-expressing ventricular myocytes. In contrast, expression of beta(2a) T498A or L493A mutants mimicked the protective effects of ryanodine or global cellular CaMKII inhibition by reducing Ca(2+) entry through Ca(V)1.2 and inhibiting EADs. Furthermore, Ca(V)1.2 currents recorded from cells overexpressing CaMKII phosphorylation- or binding-incompetent beta(2a) subunits were incapable of entering a CaMKII-dependent high-activity gating mode (mode 2), indicating that beta(2a) Thr 498 and Leu 493 are required for Ca(V)1.2 activation by CaMKII in native cells. These data show that CaMKII binding and phosphorylation sites on beta(2a) are concise but pivotal components of a molecular and biophysical and mechanism for EADs and impaired survival in adult cardiomyocytes."

METHODS: According to the occurrence of cardioversion, 138 patients with mitral valve replacement were divided into conversion group and non-conversion group, and based on the duration of sinus rhythm, the patients in conversion group were divided into < 3 days group and > 3 days group. Triiodothyronine (T3) was detected by radioimmunoassay in all the patients. RESULTS: T3 metabolism decreased significantly after the operation in all the patients. Early spontaneous cardioversion of AF occurred 2 h after the operation in 52 cases (37.7%), and 28 (20.3%) of the cases had a duration of sinus rhythm longer than 3 days. T3 was significantly decreased in conversion group and non-conversion group by 44.5% and 58.7% at 2 h, by 40.0% and 52.4% at 24 h and by 28.6% and 37.7% at 72 h after the operation, respectively. The levels of T3 in conversion group was significantly higher than the levels in non-conversion group, and showed no significant variation with the duration of sinus rhythm. CONCLUSION: Enhancement of T3 levels after mitral valve replacement may increase the probability of early spontaneous cardioversion of AF, but can not affect the duration of sinus rhythm. This finding supports the supplementation of T3 perioperatively in patients undergoing cardiac surgeries."

We used poly(A)-position profiling by sequencing (3P-seq) to map poly(A) sites at eight developmental stages and tissues in the zebrafish. Analysis of over 60 million 3P-seq reads substantially increased and improved existing 3' UTR annotations, resulting in confidently identified 3' UTRs for >79% of the annotated protein-coding genes in zebrafish. mRNAs from most zebrafish genes undergo alternative CPA, with those from more than a thousand genes using different dominant 3' UTRs at different stages. These included one of the poly(A) polymerase genes, for which alternative CPA reinforces its repression in the ovary. 3' UTRs tend to be shortest in the ovaries and longest in the brain. Isoforms with some of the shortest 3' UTRs are highly expressed in the ovary, yet absent in the maternally contributed RNAs of the embryo, perhaps because their 3' UTRs are too short to accommodate a uridine-rich motif required for stability of the maternal mRNA. At 2 h post-fertilization, thousands of unique poly(A) sites appear at locations lacking a typical polyadenylation signal, which suggests a wave of widespread cytoplasmic polyadenylation of mRNA degradation intermediates. Our insights into the identities, formation, and evolution of zebrafish 3' UTRs provide a resource for studying gene regulation during vertebrate development."

The ROCKET AF trial compared rivaroxaban (20 mg/day; 15 mg/day in patients with creatinine clearance 30-49 ml/min) with dose-adjusted warfarin (international normalized ratio 2-3) in 14,264 patients with AF and a prior history of stroke or at least two other additional risk factors for stroke. The ROCKET AF trial demonstrated the noninferiority of rivaroxaban compared with warfarin for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism, with a similar rate of major bleeding and a substantial reduction in intracranial hemorrhage. These results, in conjunction with its convenient once-daily dosing regimen, make rivaroxaban an attractive alternative to warfarin for stroke prevention in AF."

ADAM17 is overexpressed in a variety of human tumors, which is associated with tumor development and progression. In the present study, we sought to investigate the expression and function of ADAM17 in hypoxia-treated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. Western blot analysis was used to measure the expression of ADAM17 in HCC cell lines (Hep3B and HepG2 cells). Annexin V/PI double staining was performed to analyze the effects of ADAM17 on hypoxia-mediated cisplatin resistance. ADAM17 expression was upregulated by hypoxia treatment in HCC cells at both mRNA and protein levels. Overexpression of ADAM17 reduced cisplatin-induced apoptosis in HCC cells, accompanies by less cleavage of caspase-3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Forced expression of ADAM17 enhanced the phosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Akt without affecting the expression of total EGFR and Akt. Pretreatment with EGFR inhibitor AG1478 or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002 rescued ADAM17-mediated cisplatin resistance of HCC cells. ADAM17 silencing attenuated hypoxia-induced cisplatin resistance and enhanced the accumulation of cleaved caspase-3 and PARP. Western blot analysis showed that overexpression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha), a transcription factor, upregulated the expression of ADAM17 and HIF-1alpha silencing downregulated the expression of ADAM17 in hypoxia-treated HCC cells, indicating the regulation of ADAM17 by HIF-1alpha. Taken together, our results indicated that ADAM17 is upregulated by hypoxia and contributes to hypoxia-induced cisplatin resistance via EGFR/PI3K/Akt pathway."

In this study, patients with melanocytosis who developed uveal melanoma were found to have double the risk for metastasis compared with those without melanocytosis. OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationship of oculo(dermal) melanocytosis to the prognosis of patients with uveal melanoma. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Retrospective chart review of 7872 patients with uveal melanoma treated at the Ocular Oncology Service, Wills Eye Institute, from August 25, 1970, through August 27, 2008. EXPOSURES: Enucleation, plaque radiotherapy, local resection, or thermotherapy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Metastasis and death. RESULTS: Of 7872 patients with uveal melanoma, oculo(dermal) melanocytosis was present in 230 (3%). The melanocytosis involved the sclera (92%), iris (17%), choroid (12%), eyelid (8%), and temporal fossa (1%). Eyes with melanoma and oculo(dermal) melanocytosis had a relative risk for metastasis 1.6 times greater compared with those with no melanocytosis (P < .001). Metastasis of uveal melanoma was 2.8 times higher in patients with iris melanocytosis (P < .001), 2.6 times higher with choroidal melanocytosis (P = .02), and 1.9 times higher with scleral melanocytosis (P < .001). By Kaplan-Meier estimates, metastasis in patients with oculo(dermal) melanocytosis vs no melanocytosis was 2% vs 1.8% at 1 year, 27% vs 15% at 5 years, and 48% vs 24% at 10 years (P < .001). By multivariable analysis, the factors predictive of metastasis in patients harboring uveal melanoma associated with oculo(dermal) melanocytosis were increased tumor thickness (P = .001) and the presence of subretinal fluid (P = .05), and the only factor predictive of death was increased tumor thickness (P = .009). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Patients with uveal melanoma associated with oculo(dermal) melanocytosis have double the risk for metastasis compared with those with no melanocytosis. All patients with oculo(dermal) melanocytosis should undergo ophthalmic examination and imaging on a twice-yearly basis because this could help with the early detection of melanoma."

However, there are situations in which measurements of the drug and its effect are desirable. We therefore compared and validated different coagulation methods for assessments of dabigatran in clinical samples in relation to measurements of plasma dabigatran, without the purpose of establishing effective and safe concentrations of dabigatran in plasma. METHODS: Samples were obtained from 70 atrial fibrillation patients treated with dabigatran etexilate. Plasma concentrations were measured using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and were compared with coagulation methods Hemoclot thrombin inhibitors (HTI) and Ecarin clotting assay (ECA), as well as with prothrombin time-international normalized ratio (PT-INR) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). RESULTS: A wide range of dabigatran concentrations was determined by LC-MS/MS (<0.5-586 ng/mL). Correlations between LC-MS/MS results and estimated concentrations were excellent for both HTI and ECA overall (r(2) = 0.97 and 0.96 respectively, p < 0.0001), but the precision and variability of these assays were not fully satisfactory in the low range of dabigatran plasma concentrations, in which ECA performed better than HTI. aPTT performed poorly, and was normal (<40 s) even with dabigatran levels of 60 ng/mL. PT-INR was normal even at supratherapeutic dabigatran concentrations. CONCLUSION: LC-MS/MS is the gold standard for measurements of dabigatran in plasma. Alternatively, either HTI or ECA assays may be used, but neither of these assays is dependable when monitoring low levels or to infer total absence of dabigatran. The aPTT assay is relatively insensitive to dabigatran, and normal aPTT results may be observed even with therapeutic dabigatran concentrations."

Emphasis is given to compounds acting downstream of dystrophin, the protein lacking in DMD, on cellular pathways leading to pathological consequences. The author highlights the progress that may have the greatest potential for clinical use in DMD. RECENT FINDINGS: Modifying the transcripts of the mutated gene by exon skipping has led to expression of shortened dystrophins in DMD patients. Currently, the most promising potential drugs are the exon-skipping agents eteplirsen and drisapersen. Biglycan and SMTC1100 upregulate utrophin. The steroid receptor modulating compounds VBP15 and tamoxifen, and specific antioxidants appear promising agents for symptomatic therapy. SUMMARY: The past 18 months have seen a strong increase in the number of exciting reports on novel therapeutic agents for DMD. Exon-skipping agents have been fine-tuned to improve tissue delivery and stability. Impressive discoveries regarding pathogenic events in cellular signalling have revealed targets that were unknown in the context of DMD, thus enabling approaches that limit inflammation, fibrosis and necrosis. The targets are nuclear hormone receptors, NADPH-oxidases and Ca channels. Inhibition of NF-KB, transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta)/myostatin production or action are also promising routes in counteracting the complex pathogenesis of DMD."

CaMKII activation is seen in heart failure, and can directly induce pathological changes in ion channels, Ca(2+) handling and gene transcription. Here, in human, rat and mouse, we identify a novel mechanism linking CaMKII and hyperglycaemic signalling in diabetes mellitus, which is a key risk factor for heart and neurodegenerative diseases. Acute hyperglycaemia causes covalent modification of CaMKII by O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc). O-GlcNAc modification of CaMKII at Ser 279 activates CaMKII autonomously, creating molecular memory even after Ca(2+) concentration declines. O-GlcNAc-modified CaMKII is increased in the heart and brain of diabetic humans and rats. In cardiomyocytes, increased glucose concentration significantly enhances CaMKII-dependent activation of spontaneous sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) release events that can contribute to cardiac mechanical dysfunction and arrhythmias. These effects were prevented by pharmacological inhibition of O-GlcNAc signalling or genetic ablation of CaMKIIdelta. In intact perfused hearts, arrhythmias were aggravated by increased glucose concentration through O-GlcNAc- and CaMKII-dependent pathways. In diabetic animals, acute blockade of O-GlcNAc inhibited arrhythmogenesis. Thus, O-GlcNAc modification of CaMKII is a novel signalling event in pathways that may contribute critically to cardiac and neuronal pathophysiology in diabetes and other diseases. "

Here, we evaluate the scope of global epigenetic alterations at enhancers and insulator elements in prostate and breast cancer cells using simultaneous genome-wide mapping of DNA methylation and nucleosome occupancy (NOMe-seq). We find that the genomic location of nucleosome-depleted regions (NDRs) is mostly cell type specific and preferentially found at enhancers in normal cells. In cancer cells, however, we observe a global reconfiguration of NDRs at distal regulatory elements coupled with a substantial reorganization of the cancer methylome. Aberrant acquisition of nucleosomes at enhancer-associated NDRs is associated with hypermethylation and epigenetic silencing marks, and conversely, loss of nucleosomes with demethylation and epigenetic activation. Remarkably, we show that nucleosomes remain strongly organized and phased at many facultative distal regulatory elements, even in the absence of a NDR as an anchor. Finally, we find that key transcription factor (TF) binding sites also show extensive peripheral nucleosome phasing, suggesting the potential for TFs to organize NDRs genome-wide and contribute to deregulation of cancer epigenomes. Together, our findings suggest that \"decommissioning\" of NDRs and TFs at distal regulatory elements in cancer cells is accompanied by DNA hypermethylation susceptibility of enhancers and insulator elements, which in turn may contribute to an altered genome-wide architecture and epigenetic deregulation in malignancy.

Immunomodulation with the antiprogrammed death-1/programmed death-ligand 1 monoclonal antibodies has shown to mediate tumor shrinkage and extend overall survival from several pivotal phase I/II studies in melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, and non-small cell lung cancer. This has prompted multiple large ongoing phase III trials with the expectation for fast-track FDA approvals to satisfy unmet medical needs. Compounds targeting the programmed death-1 pathway that are in clinical trials fall into two major categories, namely antiprogrammed death-1 antibodies: Nivolumab, MK-3475, and pidilizumab; and antiprogrammed death-ligand 1 antibodies: MPDL3280A, BMS-936559, MEDI4736, and MSB0010718C. We reviewed the clinical efficacy and safety of each compound based upon major registered clinical trials and published clinical data. Overall, response rate of more than 20% is consistently seen across all these trials, with maximal response of approximately 50% achieved by certain single antiprogrammed death-1 agents or when used in combination with cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 blockade. The responses seen are early, durable, and have continued after treatment discontinuation. Immune-related adverse events are the most common side effects seen in these clinical trials. Overall, the skin and gastrointestinal tract are the most common organ systems affected by these compounds while hepatic, endocrine, and neurologic events are less frequent. These side effects are low grade, manageable, and typically resolve within a relatively short time frame with a predictable resolution pattern given proper management. We therefore propose detailed guidelines for management of major immune-related adverse events that are anticipated with antiprogrammed death-1/programmed death-ligand 1 therapies based on general experience with other monoclonal antibodies and the established management algorithms for immune-related adverse events for cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 blockade with ipilimumab.

Operons are present in the class Chromadorea, one of the two main nematode classes, but their distribution in the other class, the Enoplea, is not known. We have surveyed the genomes of Trichinella spiralis, Trichuris muris, and Romanomermis culicivorax and identified the first putative operons in members of the Enoplea. Consistent with the mechanism of polycistronic RNA resolution in other nematodes, the mRNAs produced by genes downstream of the first gene in the T. spiralis and T. muris operons are trans-spliced to spliced leader RNAs, and we are able to detect polycistronic RNAs derived from these operons. Importantly, a putative intercistronic region from one of these potential enoplean operons confers polycistronic processing activity when expressed as part of a chimeric operon in Caenorhabditis elegans. We find that T. spiralis genes located in operons have an increased likelihood of having operonic C. elegans homologs. However, operon structure in terms of synteny and gene content is not tightly conserved between the two taxa, consistent with models of operon evolution. We have nevertheless identified putative operons conserved between Enoplea and Chromadorea.

METHODS: Male mice underwent a unilateral (right) nephrectomy followed by 30 minutes of contralateral (left) clamping of the renal artery. We studied 4 groups at 20 minutes and 24 hours of reperfusion: a sham group (n = 4), an ischemic group (n = 6), CsA-postconditioned group (postcond-CsA, injection of 3 mg/kg of CsA 5 minutes before the end of ischemia, (n = 6), and an ischemic postconditioning (IPC) group (n = 6), consisting of 3 cycles of 30 seconds of renal ischemia with 30 seconds intervening reperfusion. After 24 hours of reperfusion, we measured plasma creatinine, urea, and histological kidney injury. The kidney mitochondria were isolated to assess the mitochondria calcium retention capacity and oxidative phosphorylation. RESULTS: At 24 hours after reperfusion, serum creatinine decreased in postcond-CsA and IPC compared to ischemic group. The histological score was also significantly improved with postcond-CsA and IPC. At 20 minutes and 24 hours of reperfusion, calcium retention capacity was decreased significantly in the ischemic group. The mitochondrial respiration stay decreased in the ischemic group at 24 hours of reperfusion, whereas the respiration was improved significantly in the postcond-CsA and IPC group. Bax and cleaved caspase 3 decreased in PostCsA and IPC group. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that IPC and CsA, administered immediately before reperfusion, protect the kidney from lethal injury."

However, their benefits have been disputed by a statin-related increased risk of new onset diabetes (NOD) in randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses. AREAS COVERED: This review provides an update based on recent outstanding evidence on the statin effect on the risk of diabetes. It also describes mechanisms potentially explaining adverse effects of statins on glucose homeostasis. PubMed was searched for original articles and reviews published from January 2010 (inclusive) to May 2015 (inclusive), which include the Search terms statins, diabetes, glucose, and insulin. NOD risk seems to be more relevant with high-intensity rather than with low-intensity statin treatment. Also, this risk is particularly increased in patients at risk for the development of diabetes. It appears that statins adversely affect glucose homeostasis in parallel with their 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A inhibition capacity. It was suggested that lipophilic statins are more diabetogenic than the hydrophilic ones. Mechanisms explaining statin diabetogeneicity include impaired insulin secretion by pancreatic beta cells together with increased insulin resistance of various tissues. EXPERT OPINION: The CV outcome benefits from statin use outweigh the diabetes menace. However, patients at risk for the development of diabetes should be prescribed statins with caution."

MATERIALS/METHODS: We report the ophthalmologic findings, documented by examinations under anesthesia with clinical photography and fluorescein angiography, as well as the systemic manifestations and genetic and molecular testing, in identical twins with Revesz syndrome, and compare and contrast these features to those of other pediatric retinal vasculopathies. RESULTS: Both twins exhibited widespread avascularity and anomalous vasculature of the retinal periphery, retinal telangiectasias, and exudation. One twin developed a combination exudative/tractional/rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, while the other exhibited a focal collection of buds of retinal neovascularization. Both twins developed bone marrow failure and were found to have cerebellar hypoplasia and widespread cerebral calcifications. Telomere testing in lymphocytes and granulocytes revealed telomere length less than the 1st percentile for age, and gene sequencing revealed a novel mutation in the TINF2 gene, resulting in the T284P TIN2 protein variant. CONCLUSIONS: We report ophthalmic findings in twins with Revesz syndrome due to a previously unreported mutation in TINF2 and propose that phenotypic and molecular overlaps between DKC spectrum disorders and pediatric retinal vasculopathies may reflect a shared pathophysiologic basis."

To elucidate the influence of l-arginine on the activation of endogenous antioxidant defence, male Wistar rats were orally administered daily with l-arginine at different levels of 25, 50, 100 mg/100 g body weight. After 7 and 14 days feeding, the antioxidative capacities and glutathione (GSH) contents in the plasma and in the liver were uniformly enhanced with the increasing consumption of l-arginine, whereas the oxidative stress was effectively suppressed by l-arginine treatment. After 14 days feeding, the mRNA levels and protein expressions of Keap1 and Cul3 were gradually reduced by increasing l-arginine intake, resulting that the nuclear factor Nrf2 was activated. Upon activation of Nrf2, the expressions of antioxidant responsive element (ARE)-dependent genes and proteins (GCLC, GCLM, GS, GR, GST, GPx, CAT, SOD, NQO1, HO-1) were up-regulated by l-arginine feeding, indicating an upward trend in antioxidant capacity uniformly with the increasing consumption of l-arginine. The present study demonstrates that the supplementation of l-arginine stimulates GSH synthesis and activates Nrf2 pathway, leading to the up-regulation of ARE-driven antioxidant expressions via Nrf2-Keap1 pathway. Results suggest the availability of l-arginine is a critical factor to suppress oxidative stress and induce an endogenous antioxidant response."

NAC can scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) and maintain reduced glutathione (GSH) levels, in order to protect cardiomyocytes from oxidative stress. The present study aimed to determine whether NAC protects cardiomyocytes from oxidative damage by regulating the redox status of intracellular antioxidant proteins. The results revealed that NAC pretreatment increased cell viability and inhibited the activation of caspase-3, -8 and -9 during hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced oxidative stress in H9c2 cells. Furthermore, decreased ROS levels, and increased total and reduced GSH levels were detected in response to NAC pretreatment. Non-reducing redox western blotting was performed to detect the redox status of intracellular antioxidant proteins, including thioredoxin 1 (Trx1), peroxiredoxin 1 (Prx1), GSH reductase (GSR), and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN). The results revealed that the reduced form of Trx1 was markedly increased, and the oxidized forms of Prx1, GSR and PTEN were decreased following NAC pretreatment. Furthermore, NAC pretreatment decreased H2O2-induced phosphorylation of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1, which depends on the redox state of Trx1, and increased H2O2-induced phosphorylation of protein kinase B, which is essential to cell survival. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to reveal that NAC pretreatment may alleviate oxidation of intracellular antioxidant proteins to inhibit oxidative stress-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis."

IMH is distinguished from AAD by the absence of an intimal tear and flap. With short-term outcomes being similar to type B AAD, IMH is treated identically to AAD in the corresponding segment of the aorta. While all patients with any acute aortic syndrome of the descending aorta receive prompt anti-impulse therapy, thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) is reserved for patients presenting with certain complications, namely malperfusion, rupture, or periaortic hematoma. Technical aspects of TEVAR for IMH include maximal endograft oversizing of 10% with 20 mm landing zones of the healthy aorta, revascularization of the left subclavian artery when covered, use of cerebrospinal fluid drainage with extensive coverage, and restoration of branch vessel perfusion. With respect to disease evolution, IMH may progress to classic AD, frank rupture, or aneurysmal dilation; yet, IMH may also regress and be completely resorbed. However, since the natural history of IMH is unpredictable, TEVAR is being used more aggressively to improve long-term survival, rates of secondary reintervention, and positive aortic remodeling. Much remains unknown for acute type B IMH, including the use of prophylactic TEVAR for stable uncomplicated presentations, as well as the optimal timing of intervention and certain technical aspects of TEVAR.

Curcumin (CUR) is a polyphenolic phytochemical that stimulates reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, while disulfiram (DSS) is a US FDA-approved drug for the treatment of alcoholism that can act by inhibiting the intracellular antioxidant system. Therefore, we hypothesized that they act synergistically against melanoma cells. Herein, we aimed to study the antitumor potential of the combination of CUR with DSS in B16-F10 melanoma cells using in vitro and in vivo models. The cytotoxic effects of different combination ratios of CUR and DSS were evaluated using the Alamar Blue method, allowing the production of isobolograms. Apoptosis detection, DNA fragmentation, cell cycle distribution, and mitochondrial superoxide levels were quantified by flow cytometry. Tumor development in vivo was evaluated using C57BL/6 mice bearing B16-F10 cells. The combinations ratios of 1:2, 1:3, and 2:3 showed synergic effects. B16-F10 cells treated with these combinations showed improved apoptotic cell death and DNA fragmentation. Enhanced mitochondrial superoxide levels were observed at combination ratios of 1:2 and 1:3, indicating increased oxidative stress. In vivo tumor growth inhibition for CUR (20 mg/kg), DSS (60 mg/kg), and their combination were 17.0%, 19.8%, and 28.8%, respectively.

Conventional diagnostic techniques, including clinical diagnosis, serology, histopathology and radiology, have limitations in diagnosing the disease at an early stage. This warrants the need for advanced diagnostic tools such as nucleic acid diagnostics, advanced serological tests (ELISpot), PCR (pan-Mucorale test) and multiplex PCR. These techniques have been introduced to identify this invasive fungal infection at an incipient stage, thereby helping clinicians to prevent adverse outcomes. The use of biosensors and micro-needle based diagnostic methodologies will pave the way for devising more point-of-care tests that can be employed for the detection of mucormycosis at an incipient stage.

Although preferential retention of TPP has been demonstrated for the breast carcinoma cell line MCF-7, this compound had not been tested previously on cells derived from nervous system tumors. In the present study, tritiated-TPP (3H-TPP) uptake and retention for eight different cell cultures of three histologically different types of nervous system tumors was measured and the data were compared to a positive control (MCF-7) and negative controls (normal African Green monkey kidney epithelium (CV-1) and the normal human fibroblast (WI-38) cell lines). Uptake and retention characteristics could be grouped by specific pathological tumor types, but individual tumor variability was notable. Malignant astrocytoma (grade III/III glioblastoma) and malignant neurofibrosarcoma cells showed preferential uptake and retention of 3H-TPP relative to meningioma cells and normal controls. A clonogenic assay utilizing the cytotoxic lipophilic cationic compound dequalinium showed strong retainers of 3H-TPP to be more susceptible to the effects of dequalinium than weak retainers. These data demonstrate that certain human and experimental animal nervous system tumor cell lines retain lipophilic compounds possessing a delocalized positive charge.

In this study, we quantitated HER2/neu expression by image analysis, and applied this analyzing system to help to minimize interobserver variability of the interpretation of the HercepTestTM. All the immunostained results were scored semiquantitatively on a range of 0 to 3+ in accordance with the criteria described as per the manufacturer's instructions, and quantitatively evaluated using an image analyzing system with image processing software. Among the 92 cases, 15 were scored as 3+, six were 2+, and 32 were 1+ under intraobservers agreement. When the cases were quantitated, a high correlation was shown between the signal area extracted by image analysis and the corresponding score of staining intensity with the HercepTestTM. By converting the quantitatively extracted data into a scoring system based upon the criteria, the outcome demonstrated a strong concordance with the scoring data obtained from immunostaining.

There are no data on the bone effects of functional hyperprolactinaemia. The aim was to assess the influence of hyperprolactinaemia of various origins on bone turnover and density in different skeletal sites. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was carried out in 75 women (aged 30.53 +/- 7.8): Group I--32 women with prolactinoma and Group II--43 women with functional hyperprolactinaemia. Both groups of patients were subdivided into those with hypogonadism and those with normal gonadal function. The control group consisted of 29 healthy women aged (33.59 +/- 4.7). In all subjects PRL and bone turnover markers (BAP, OC, ICTP) were studied. BMD measurements (lumbar spine, forearm, proximal femur and total body) were carried out using DXA. RESULTS: Higher PRL concentrations were observed in patients than in controls. The values of bone turnover markers (BAP, ICTP) were shown to be higher in patient groups and subgroups than in controls. In patients with prolactinoma lumbar spine BMD was lower than in patients with functional hyperprolactinaemia and controls. Total body BMD was also lower, albeit to a lesser extent. CONCLUSIONS: Hyperprolactinaemia caused by prolactinoma in women influences bone metabolism unfavourably, more by the impact on the activity of bone turnover markers than on BMD. This provides an opportunity for earlier assessment of bone metabolism disturbances before the BMD changes can be observed. Functional hyperprolactinaemia does not determine such a harmful effect on bone metabolism as hyperprolactinemia due to prolactinoma."

The molecular mechanisms, which control both the initial development and subsequent maintenance of these critical microenvironments, are poorly defined. Wnt signaling has been shown to be important to the development of several epithelial tissues and organs. Regulation of Wnt signaling has also been shown to impact both early thymocyte and thymic epithelial development. However, early blocks in thymic organogenesis or death of the mice have prevented analysis of a role of canonical Wnt signaling in the maintenance of TECs in the postnatal thymus. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we demonstrate that tetracycline-regulated expression of the canonical Wnt inhibitor DKK1 in TECs localized in both the cortex and medulla of adult mice, results in rapid thymic degeneration characterized by a loss of DeltaNP63(+) Foxn1(+) and Aire(+) TECs, loss of K5K8DP TECs thought to represent or contain an immature TEC progenitor, decreased TEC proliferation and the development of cystic structures, similar to an aged thymus. Removal of DKK1 from DKK1-involuted mice results in full recovery, suggesting that canonical Wnt signaling is required for the differentiation or proliferation of TEC populations needed for maintenance of properly organized adult thymic epithelial microenvironments. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Taken together, the results of this study demonstrate that canonical Wnt signaling within TECs is required for the maintenance of epithelial microenvironments in the postnatal thymus, possibly through effects on TEC progenitor/stem cell populations. Downstream targets of Wnt signaling, which are responsible for maintenance of these TEC progenitors may provide useful targets for therapies aimed at counteracting age associated thymic involution or the premature thymic degeneration associated with cancer therapy and bone marrow transplants."

Dickkopf 1 (Dkk1), a major secreted Wnt signaling antagonist, binds to LRP6 with high affinity and prevents the Frizzled-Wnt-LRP6 complex formation in response to Wnts. Previous studies have demonstrated that Dkk1 promotes LRP6 internalization and degradation when it forms a ternary complex with the cell surface receptor Kremen. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In the present study, we found that transfected Dkk1 induces LRP6 accumulation while inhibiting Wnt/LRP6 signaling. Treatment with Dkk1-conditioned medium or recombinant Dkk1 protein stabilized LRP6 with a prolonged half-life and induces LRP6 accumulation both at the cell surface and in endosomes. We also demonstrated that Kremen2 co-expression abrogated the effect of Dkk1 on LRP6 accumulation, indicating that the effect of Kremen2 is dominant over Dkk1 regulation of LRP6. Furthermore, we found that Wnt3A treatment induces LRP6 down-regulation, an effect paralleled with a Wnt/LRP6 signaling decay, and that Dkk1 treatment blocked Wnt3A-induced LRP6 down-regulation. Finally, we found that LRP6 turnover was blocked by an inhibitor of caveolae-mediated endocytosis. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results reveal a novel role for Dkk1 in preventing Wnt ligand-induced LRP6 down-regulation and contribute significantly to our understanding of Dkk1 function in Wnt/LRP6 signaling."

Cavernous sinus (CS) apex was exposed by drilling a triangle bounded by V2 and its canal inferiorly, bone between FR and superior orbital fissure (SOF) anteriorly, and ophthalmic nerve (V1) superiorly. Drilling was continued toward the annulus of Zinn (AZ) and optic nerve superiorly and over the intracavernous ICA posteriorly. Endoscopic measurements between V2, SOF, AZ, and opticocarotid recess were obtained. Endoscopic systematic orientation of parasellar anatomy is presented that can be helpful for approaching sphenoid sinus with ill-defined bony landmarks."

        "text": "BOCTOPUS: improved topology prediction of transmembrane beta barrel proteins.\nMOTIVATION: Transmembrane beta barrel proteins (TMBs) are found in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, chloroplast and mitochondria. They play a major role in the translocation machinery, pore formation, membrane anchoring and ion exchange. TMBs are also promising targets for antimicrobial drugs and vaccines. Given the difficulty in membrane protein structure determination, computational methods to identify TMBs and predict the topology of TMBs are important. RESULTS: Here, we present BOCTOPUS; an improved method for the topology prediction of TMBs by employing a combination of support vector machines (SVMs) and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). The SVMs and HMMs account for local and global residue preferences, respectively. Based on a 10-fold cross-validation test, BOCTOPUS performs better than all existing methods, reaching a Q3 accuracy of 87%. Further, BOCTOPUS predicted the correct number of strands for 83% proteins in the dataset. BOCTOPUS might also help in reliable identification of TMBs by using it as an additional filter to methods specialized in this task. AVAILABILITY: BOCTOPUS is freely available as a web server at: http://boctopus.cbr.su.se/. The datasets used for training and evaluations are also available from this site."

In addition to this tumor suppressor function for pro-oncogenic cells, p53 also plays an important role as the central regulator of stress response by maintaining cellular homeostasis at the molecular and biochemical level. p53 regulates aerobic respiration at the glycolytic and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) steps via transcriptional regulation of its downstream genes TP53-induced glycolysis regulator (TIGAR) and synthesis of cytochrome c oxidase (SCO2). p53 negatively regulates glycolysis through activation of TIGAR (an inhibitor of the fructose-2,6-bisphosphate). On the contrary p53 positively regulates OXPHOS through upregulation of SCO2, a member of the COX-2 assembly involved in the electron-transport chain. It is interesting to notice that p53 antagonistically regulates the inter-dependent glycolytic and OXPHOS cycles. It is important to understand whether the p53-mediated transcriptional regulation of TIGAR and SCO2 is temporally segregated in cancer cells and what is the relation between these paradoxical regulations of glycolytic pathway with the tumor suppressor activity of p53. In this review we will elucidate the importance of p53-mediated regulation of glycolysis and OXPHOS and its relation with the tumor suppressor function of p53. Further since cellular metabolism shares great relation with the process of aging we will also try and establish the role of p53 in regulation of aging via its transcriptional control of cellular metabolism."

Increasing SERCA2a expression in HF models improves cardiac function. We used direct cardiac delivery of adeno-associated virus encoding human SERCA2a (AAV6-hSERCA2a) in HF and normal canine models to study safety, efficacy, and the effects of immunosuppression. Tachycardic-paced dogs received left ventricle (LV) wall injection of AAV6-hSERCA2a or solvent. Pacing continued postinjection for 2 or 6 weeks, until euthanasia. Tissue/serum samples were analyzed for hSERCA2a expression (Western blot) and immune responses (histology and AAV6-neutralizing antibodies). Nonpaced dogs received AAV6-hSERCA2a and were analyzed at 12 weeks; a parallel cohort received AAV-hSERCA2a and immunosuppression. AAV-mediated cardiac expression of hSERCA2a peaked at 2 weeks and then declined (to ~50%; p<0.03, 6 vs. 2 weeks). LV end diastolic and end systolic diameters decreased in 6-week dogs treated with AAV6-hSERCA2a (p<0.05) whereas LV diameters increased in control dogs. Dogs receiving AAV6-hSERCA2a developed neutralizing antibodies (titer >=1:120) and cardiac cellular infiltration. Immunosuppression dramatically reduced immune responses (reduced inflammation and neutralizing antibody titers <1:20), and maintained hSERCA2a expression. Thus cardiac injection of AAV6-hSERCA2a promotes local hSERCA2a expression and improves cardiac function. However, the hSERCA2a protein level is reduced by host immune responses. Immunosuppression alleviates immune responses and sustains transgene expression, and may be an important adjuvant for clinical gene therapy trials."

Although a variety of human tissues can produce a number of peptidylarginine deiminase (PAD), enzymes that convert peptide bound arginine residues to citrulline, P. gingivalis is one of the few prokaryotes known to express PAD. Protein and peptide citrullination are important in the development of rheumatoid arthritis and in recent years a number of authors have suggested a possible link between periodontitis and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Indeed, some have linked P. gingivalis directly to RA via the action of PAD. Accordingly, the prime purpose of this study was to further characterise PAD in P. gingivalis cells particular emphasis on substrate specificity, using arginine containing peptides and RA relevant proteins. METHODS: P. ginigvalis W50 was anaerobically cultured in BHI broth, cells harvested and resuspended in assay buffer. A colourimetric assay was developed to measure citrulline and employed to determine enzyme activity using the substrate BAEE. The assay was employed to investigate the effects of environmental pH and temperature on activity. Citrullination of BAEE by sonicated cells allowed the proportion of intracellular enzyme to be estimated. Enzyme specificity and substrate preference were investigated by using various arginine containing peptides, proteins and arginine analogues, as substrates and measuring the rate of citrullination. The influence of gingipains on citrullination was assessed by measuring the rates of citrullination of bovine serum albumin in the presence of protease inhibitors. RESULTS: Enzyme activity decreased by 13% following exposure of cells to 60  C for 10 min. A comparison of intact and disrupted cells indicated that 90% of PAD activity is cell surface associated and the remainder cytoplasmic. Optimal pH for enzyme activity was between pH 7.5 and 8. All small arginine-containing peptides were citrullinated with reaction rates faster than that for free arginine with rates that varied with arginine residue position and number. Arginine analogues exhibited minimal effect and influence when tested as either substrates or competitive inhibitors. Cells were able to citrullinate yeast enolase, human vimentin and fibrin at varying rates. All proteins were modified at slower rates than those for peptide substrates. Inhibition of gingipains had no influence on the rate of protein citrullination. CONCLUSIONS: P. gingivalis PAD is a primarily cell surface associated, heat stable, enzyme that exhibits optimal activity under alkaline conditions similar to those present in the inflammatory environment. The enzyme displays high specificity for arginine residues in peptides and modified arginine in all positions and the gingipains did not influence the rate of protein citrullination. The ability of the enzyme to convert arginine residues in all proteins tested would indicate that its presence in inflamed tissue may promote autoimmune reactions by creation of altered host epitopes."

The study included 54 patients; 20 non-smokers, 9 ex-smokers, 14 mild to moderate smokers and 11 heavy smokers. Fifteen normal volunteers were also studied as controls. Disease stage was clinically and radiologically determined, rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-CCP antibodies were measured in serum. Higher percentage of severe disease (stage III) was seen in heavy smoker patients than mild to moderate smokers (54.6% versus 35.7%) and in moderate smokers than ex-smokers (35.7% versus 33.6%). Lowest percentage of severe disease was seen in non-smokers (15%). RF and anti-CCP were significantly higher in smoker than non-smoker and in heavy than mild to moderate smoker patients (p < 0.01, p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, p < 0.001, respectively). In smoker patients, both RF and anti-CCP antibodies correlated significantly and positively with smoking index (r = 0.581, p < 0.001; r = 0.661, p < 0.001). Also, smoking index and anti-CCP correlated significantly and positively with disease stage (r = 0.424, p < 0.05; r = 0.523, p < 0.01). It appears from our results that, tobacco smoking mostly play a role in progression of rheumatoid arthritis through tissue protein citrullination.

Targeting the CLL membrane and associated signaling patterns is a current focus of therapeutic development. Many tumor membrane targets are simultaneously targeted by humoral immunity, thus forming recognizable immunoglobulin responses. We sought to use this immune response to identify novel membrane-associated targets for CLL. Using a novel strategy, we interrogated CLL membrane-specific autologous immunoglobulin G reactivity. Our analysis unveiled lymphocyte cytosolic protein 1 (LCP1), a lymphocyte-specific target that is highly expressed in CLL. LCP1 plays a critical role in B-cell biology by crosslinking F-actin filaments, thereby solidifying cytoskeletal structures and providing a scaffold for critical signaling pathways. Small interfering RNA knockdown of LCP1 blocked migration toward CXCL12 in transwell assays and to bone marrow in an in vivo xenotransplant model, confirming a role for LCP1 in leukemia migration. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor ibrutinib or the PI3K inhibitor idelalisib block B-cell receptor induced activation of LCP1. Our data demonstrate a novel strategy to identify cancer membrane target antigens using humoral anti-tumor immunity. In addition, we identify LCP1 as a membrane-associated target in CLL with confirmed pathogenic significance.

Furthermore, gene expression profiling of multiple TEC subpopulations revealed striking, persistent overexpression of several candidate genes including Irx2 and Zfp503 (transcription factors), Alcam and Cd133 (cell surface markers), Ccl4 and neurotensin (Nts) (angiocrine factors), and Gpr182 and Cnr2 (G protein-coupled receptors).

Often referred to as the Guardian of the Genome, the list of known functions of p53 include regulatory roles in cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, angiogenesis, DNA repair and cell senescence. More recently, p53 has been implicated as a key molecular player regulating substrate metabolism and exercise-induced mitochondrial biogenesis in skeletal muscle. In this context, the study of p53 therefore has obvious implications for both human health and performance, given that impaired mitochondrial content and function is associated with the pathology of many metabolic disorders such as ageing, type 2 diabetes, obesity and cancer, as well as reduced exercise performance. Studies on p53 knockout (KO) mice collectively demonstrate that ablation of p53 content reduces intermyofibrillar (IMF) and subsarcolemmal (SS) mitochondrial yield, reduces cytochrome c oxidase (COX) activity and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator 1-alpha protein content whilst also reducing mitochondrial respiration and increasing reactive oxygen species production during state 3 respiration in IMF mitochondria. Additionally, p53 KO mice exhibit marked reductions in exercise capacity (in the magnitude of 50 %) during fatiguing swimming, treadmill running and electrical stimulation protocols. p53 may regulate contractile-induced increases in mitochondrial content via modulating mitochondrial transcription factor A (Tfam) content and/or activity, given that p53 KO mice display reduced skeletal muscle mitochondrial DNA, Tfam messenger RNA and protein levels. Furthermore, upon muscle contraction, p53 is phosphorylated on serine 15 and subsequently translocates to the mitochondria where it forms a complex with Tfam to modulate expression of mitochondrial-encoded subunits of the COX complex. In human skeletal muscle, the exercise-induced phosphorylation of p53(Ser15) is enhanced in conditions of reduced carbohydrate availability in association with enhanced upstream signalling through 5'adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase but not p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. In this way, undertaking regular exercise in carbohydrate restricted states may therefore be a practical approach to achieve the physiological benefits of consistent p53 signalling. Although our knowledge of p53 in exercise metabolism has advanced considerably, much of our current understanding of p53 regulation and associated targets is derived from various non-muscle cells and tissues. As such, many fundamental questions remain unanswered in contracting skeletal muscle. Detailed studies concerning the time-course of p53 activation (including additional post-translational modifications and subsequent subcellular translocation), as well as the effects of exercise modality (endurance versus resistance), intensity, duration, fibre type, age, training status and nutrient availability, must now be performed so that we can optimise exercise prescription guidelines to strategically target p53 signalling. The emerging role of p53 in skeletal muscle metabolism therefore represents a novel and exciting research area for exercise and muscle physiologists."

Advantages of rivaroxaban over oral anticoagulants such as warfarin are the lack of need for ongoing monitoring, a fixed-dose regimen, and fewer drug and food interactions. Drawbacks include a lack of an antidote and the absence of a widely available method to reliably monitor the anticoagulant effect. In patients at risk of stroke due to atrial fibrillation, rivaroxaban was noninferior compared to warfarin in preventing stroke/systemic embolism in the Rivaroxaban Once Daily Oral Direct Factor Xa Inhibition Compared with Vitamin K Antagonism for Prevention of Stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation (ROCKET-AF) trial and was associated with a similar risk of major bleeding; the incidence of intracranial hemorrhage was 33% lower with rivaroxaban. Concerns raised about the trial were the adequacy of warfarin management and the increase in event rate at the end of the trial. The drug acquisition cost of rivaroxaban is higher than that of warfarin although decision-analytic models suggest that it is cost effective in atrial fibrillation. In patients with recent acute coronary syndrome, low-dose rivaroxaban reduced mortality and the composite end point of death from cardiovascular causes, myocardial infarction and stroke, but this was accompanied by an increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage and major bleeding in the Rivaroxaban in Combination With Aspirin Alone or With Aspirin and a Thienopyridine in Patients With Acute Coronary Syndromes-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (ATLAS ACS 2-TIMI) 51 trial. Thus, rivaroxaban appears to be a valuable addition to the therapeutic armamentarium in atrial fibrillation although caution should be exercised, given the limited experience in combination with novel oral antiplatelet agents. The role of rivaroxaban as part of a modern regimen in acute coronary syndrome continues to be evaluated. "

The oral factor Xa inhibitor rivaroxaban was noninferior to warfarin in the Rivaroxaban Once Daily, Oral, Direct Factor Xa Inhibition Compared With Vitamin K Antagonism for Prevention of Stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation (ROCKET AF). This prespecified secondary analysis compares outcomes in older and younger patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: There were 6229 patients (44%) aged >=75 years with atrial fibrillation and >=2 stroke risk factors randomized to warfarin (target international normalized ratio=2.0-3.0) or rivaroxaban (20 mg daily; 15 mg if creatinine clearance <50 mL/min), double blind. The primary end point was stroke and systemic embolism by intention to treat. Over 10 866 patient-years, older participants had more primary events (2.57% versus 2.05%/100 patient-years; P=0.0068) and major bleeding (4.63% versus 2.74%/100 patient-years; P<0.0001). Stroke/systemic embolism rates were consistent among older (2.29% rivaroxaban versus 2.85% warfarin per 100 patient-years; hazard ratio=0.80; 95% confidence interval, 0.63-1.02) and younger patients (2.00% versus 2.10%/100 patient-years; hazard ratio=0.95; 95% confidence interval, 0.76-1.19; interaction P=0.313), as were major bleeding rates (>=75 years: 4.86% rivaroxaban versus 4.40% warfarin per 100 patient-years; hazard ratio=1.11; 95% confidence interval, 0.92-1.34; <75 years: 2.69% versus 2.79%/100 patient-years; hazard ratio=0.96; 95% confidence interval, 0.78-1.19; interaction P=0.336). Hemorrhagic stroke rates were similar in both age groups; there was no interaction between age and rivaroxaban response. CONCLUSIONS: Elderly patients had higher stroke and major bleeding rates than younger patients, but the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban relative to warfarin did not differ with age, supporting rivaroxaban as an alternative for the elderly."

We previously demonstrated that Tpl2 regulates T cell receptor (TCR) signaling and modulates T helper cell differentiation. However, very little is known about how Tpl2 modulates the development of regulatory T cells (Tregs). Tregs are a specialized subset of T cells that express FoxP3 and possess immunosuppressive properties to limit excess inflammation. Because of the documented role of Tpl2 in promoting inflammation, we hypothesized that Tpl2 antagonizes Treg development and immunosuppressive function. Here we demonstrate that Tpl2 constrains the development of inducible Tregs. Tpl2(-/-) naive CD4(+) T cells preferentially develop into FoxP3(+) inducible Tregs in vitro as well as in vivo in a murine model of ovalbumin (OVA)-induced systemic tolerance. Treg biasing of Tpl2(-/-) T cells depended on TCR signal strength and corresponded with reduced activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Importantly, Tpl2(-/-) Tregs have basally increased expression of FoxP3 and immunosuppressive molecules, IL-10 and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4). Furthermore, they were more immunosuppressive in vivo in a T cell transfer model of colitis, as evidenced by reduced effector T cell accumulation, systemic production of inflammatory cytokines, and colonic inflammation. These results demonstrate that Tpl2 promotes inflammation in part by constraining FoxP3 expression and Treg immunosuppressive functions. Overall, these findings suggest that Tpl2 inhibition could be used to preferentially drive Treg induction and thereby limit inflammation in a variety of autoimmune diseases."

METHODS: PubMed and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials was searched for randomized controlled end-point trials of statins, with more than 1000 subjects and a minimum of one-year follow-up period, published until August 2015. The odds ratio (OR) of diabetes incidence with overall statin therapy as well as with different statins in question was calculated through random effect meta-analysis model.  RESULTS: Fourteen studies were included in the analysis with a total of 94,943 participants. Of these, 2392 subjects developed incident diabetes in the statin and 2167 in the placebo groups during a 4-year follow-up. The OR of diabetes incidence with statin therapy was significantly higher as compared with the placebo group (OR=1.11; 95% confidence interval = 1.0 to 1.2; p=0.007). There was an insignificant level of heterogeneity between the included trials (Cochran Q= 19.463, p=0.109, I2=33.20). Subgroup analysis showed that only 2 statins namely, atorvastatin (OR= 1.29; p=0.042) and rosuvastatin (OR = 1.17; p=0.01) were significantly associated.   CONCLUSION: Statin therapy can slightly increase risk of incident diabetes in subjects with hypercholesterolemia."

In addition to iPSCs, several other cell types have also been generated by master transcription factor (TF)-mediated transdifferentiation. However, the critical molecular mechanisms amongst diverse cellular identity changes are not well understood. Through the investigation of reprogramming mechanisms, we recently revealed that over-expression of constitutive active Smad3 boosted not only iPSC generation, but also 3 other master TF-mediated conversions, from B cells to macrophages, myoblasts to adipocytes, and human fibroblasts to neurons. This demonstrated that there were common mechanisms underlying different master TF-mediated cell conversions. To illuminate such mechanisms further, we have recently performed CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome-wide knockout screening during reprogramming with a lentiviral gRNA library containing 90,000 gRNAs. This screening provided us with ~15 novel reprogramming roadblock genes as well as ~20 candidate genes essential for the reprogramming process but not for ES cell self-renewal. This data set will be a valuable resource to further understand how overexpression of master TFs alters cellular identity, and to achieve more faithful, efficient cell conversions for regenerative medicine.(Presented at the 1934th Meeting, March 17, 2017)."

Recently, eteplirsen, a phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer-based splice-switching oligonucleotide (SSO) targeting DMD exon 51, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as the first antisense-based drug for DMD patients. For further exploring SSOs targeting other exons in the DMD gene, the efficacy of exon skipping and protein rescue with each SSO sequence needs evaluations in vitro. However, only a few immortalized muscle cell lines derived from DMD patients have been reported and are available to test the efficacy of exon skipping in vitro. To solve this problem, we generated a novel immortalized DMD muscle cell line from the human rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cell line. We removed DMD exons 51-57 (~0.3 Mb) in the RD cell line using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Additionally, in this DMD model cell line, we evaluated the exon 50 skipping activity of previously reported SSOs at both the mRNA and protein levels. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing of the DMD gene in the RD cell line will allow for assessment of SSOs targeting most of the rare mutations in the DMD gene."

However, the methods currently used for evaluating the editing efficiency still suffer from many limitations, including preferential detection of some mutation types, sensitivity to polymorphisms that hamper mismatch detection, lack of multiplex capability, or sensitivity to assay conditions. Here, we describe qEva-CRISPR, a new quantitative method that overcomes these limitations and allows simultaneous (multiplex) analysis of CRISPR/Cas9-induced modifications in a target and the corresponding off-targets or in several different targets. We demonstrate all of the advantages of the qEva-CRISPR method using a number of sgRNAs targeting the TP53, VEGFA, CCR5, EMX1 and HTT genes in different cell lines and under different experimental conditions. Unlike other methods, qEva-CRISPR detects all types of mutations, including point mutations and large deletions, and its sensitivity does not depend on the mutation type. Moreover, this approach allows for successful analysis of targets located in 'difficult' genomic regions. In conclusion, qEva-CRISPR may become a method of choice for unbiased sgRNA screening to evaluate experimental conditions that affect genome editing or to distinguish homology-directed repair from non-homologous end joining."

Therefore, the main aim was to quantify the amniotic fluid NAMPT in women with PPROM complicated by intra-amniotic infection, sterile IAI, or colonization. The second aim was to characterize the diagnostic indices of NAMPT to reveal IAI. The third aim was to determine whether the cervical fluid and maternal serum NAMPT quantitation might be of value in the identification of intra-amniotic inflammatory complications in PPROM.Methods of study: NAMPT levels in amniotic fluid, cervical fluid, and maternal serum were assessed in three independent cohorts of women with singleton pregnancies complicated by PPROM between 24+0 and 36+6 weeks of gestation consisting of 88, 121, and 88 women, respectively. Amniotic fluid samples were obtained by transabdominal amniocentesis, cervical fluid samples were obtained using a Dacron polyester swab and maternal blood was obtained by venipuncture of the cubital vein. The NAMPT levels were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Testing for MIAC and IAI was performed on all women, who were then categorized into four subgroups: intra-amniotic infection (MIAC and IAI), sterile IAI (IAI alone), colonization (MIAC alone), and without MIAC and IAI.Results: Women with intra-amniotic infection and women with sterile IAI had higher NAMPT levels than did women with colonization and women without MIAC and IAI (intra-amniotic infection: median 73.6 ng/mL, sterile IAI: median 55.5 ng/mL, colonization: median 12.1 ng/mL, without MIAC and IAI: 10.6 ng/mL; p < .0001). An amniotic fluid NAMPT level of 37 ng/mL was the best value for the detection of intra-amniotic infection in women with PPROM. Cervical fluid (p = .51) and maternal serum (p = .50) NAMPT levels did not reflect intra-amniotic inflammatory complications in women with PPROM.Conclusions: Intra-amniotic infection and sterile IAI are associated with higher NAMPT levels in amniotic fluid but not in cervical fluid or maternal serum in women with PPROM. Amniotic fluid NAMPT might be a marker for invasive identification of IAI in PPROM."

AC develops pulmonary metastasis in about one third of the patients and reveals a poor prognosis. However, the mechanisms of AC oncogenesis remain unclear. In this report, we aimed to clarify the mechanisms of malignant transformation of AB or AC carcinogenesis. The relatively important genes in the malignant transformation of AB were screened by DNA microarray analysis, and the expression and localization of related proteins were examined by immunohistochemistry using samples of AB and secondary AC. Two genes of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha subunit (HIF1A) and zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) were significantly and relatively upregulated in AC than in AB. Both genes were closely related in hypoxia and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In addition, expressions of HIF-1alpha and ZEB1 proteins were significantly stronger in AC than in AB. In the cell assays using ameloblastoma cell line, AM-1, hypoxia condition upregulated the expression of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and induced EMT. Furthermore, the hypoxia-induced morphological change and cell migration ability were inhibited by an antiallergic medicine tranilast. Finally, we concluded that hypoxia-induced HIF-1alpha and ZEB1 were critical for the malignant transformation of AB via TGF-beta-dependent EMT. Then, both HIF-1alpha and ZEB1 could be potential biomarkers to predict the malignant transformation of AB."

In this study, we hypothesized that miR-524-5p could be involved in the tumor microenvironment by targeting interleukin-33 (IL-33)/suppression of tumorigenicity 2 (ST2) in AB. MATERIAL AND METHODS The microRNA (miRNA) expression profile of AB tissues and normal oral mucosa tissues (NOM; 6 paired samples) was analyzed. The miRNAs with fold change >=2 and P<0.05 were considered to be differentially expressed. Among them, downregulated miR-524-5p was verified by real-time qPCR. Potential targets of miR-524-5p were predicted by bioinformatics analysis. The expression levels of target genes were detected using real-time qPCR and Western blot, respectively. Immunohistochemistry analysis of target genes was performed, and we also assessed the correlation between miR-524-5p and its target. RESULTS Microarray analysis results first indicated miR-524-5p is a downregulated miRNA in AB tissues. Real-time qPCR results confirmed the expression pattern of miR-524-5p in AB tissues. Moreover, IL-33 and its receptor ST2 were significantly overexpressed. As shown in immunohistochemistry results, IL-33 was positively expressed in lymphocytes and plasma cells, suggesting that IL-33/ST2 participates in tumor immune responses in the tumor microenvironment. Correlation analysis suggested that miR-524-5p expression was negatively correlated with IL-33/ST2. CONCLUSIONS Our findings reveal that downregulated miR-524-5p can participate in the tumor microenvironment of AB by targeting the IL-33/ST2 axis."

However, in routine laboratory tests, plasma fibrinogen levels are mostly measured using the functional Clauss method and not as an antigenic level. Therefore, it is difficult to discriminate CFD from acquired hypofibrinogenemia (aHypo). To establish a screening method for CFD, we investigated the parameters of clot waveform analysis (CWA) from the Clauss method. METHODS: We compared fibrinogen concentrations determined using Clauss and prothrombin time (PT)-derived methods for 67 aHypo and CFD cases (19 Dys, 4 Hypodys, and 1 Hypo determined using antigen levels and DNA sequence analysis) with a CS-2400 instrument, and the CWA parameters, dH and Min1, were analyzed automatically with an on-board algorithm. dH and Min1 are the maximum change in transmittance at the end of coagulation and the maximum velocity of transmittance change during coagulation, respectively. RESULTS: Clauss/PT-derived ratios detected 18 cases of Dys and Hypodys but no Hypo cases, whereas Clauss/dH plus Clauss/Min1 ratios were calculated from fibrinogen concentration using the Clauss method and CWA parameters detected 21 cases of Dys and Hypodys and one Hypo case. Moreover, the Clauss/PT-derived ratio and Clauss/dH plus Clauss/Min1 ratio detected 22 cases of Dys and Hypodys cases and one Hypo case. CONCLUSION: This report demonstrates that CWA parameters of the Clauss method, Clauss/dH plus Clauss/Min1 ratio, screened Dys patients with a higher rate, whereas Clauss/PT-derived ratios did not."

Infection often occurs in immunocompromised hosts and includes cutaneous, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, rhinocerebral, and disseminated forms of disease. Although the clinical characteristics of mucormycosis are well established, infection can be difficult to diagnose antemortem, resulting in frequent postmortem diagnoses. Despite this, the gross appearance of mucormycosis at autopsy has not been well described. In the present report we illustrate the gross and histologic findings in four autopsy cases of mucormycosis, including one case of pulmonary disease and three cases of disseminated mucormycosis with cerebral, pulmonary, hepatic, renal, and gastrointestinal involvement. In all cases autopsy examination demonstrated characteristic hemorrhagic infarcts with a targetoid appearance in the affected organs. These findings are secondary to fungal angioinvasion with subsequent thrombosis and tissue necrosis. Mucormycosis should be suspected at autopsy when these characteristic infarcts are identified within the proper clinical context, and a high suspicion for atypical infections should be maintained postmortem in immunosuppressed patients."

Coagulopathy is reflective of more severe disease and anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis is recommended in hospitalized patients. However, the prevalence of thrombosis on the intensive care unit (ICU) remains unclear, including whether this is sufficiently addressed by conventional anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis. We aimed to identify the rate of thrombotic complications in ICU-treated patients with COVID-19, to inform recommendations for diagnosis and management. A systematic review was conducted to assess the incidence of thrombotic complications in ICU-treated patients with COVID-19. Observational studies and registries reporting thrombotic complications in ICU-treated patients were included. Information extracted included patient demographics, use of thromboprophylaxis or anticoagulation, method of identifying thrombotic complications, and reported patient outcomes. In 28 studies including 2928 patients, thrombotic complications occurred in 34% of ICU-managed patients, with deep venous thrombosis reported in 16.1% and pulmonary embolism in 12.6% of patients, despite anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis, and were associated with high mortality. Studies adopting systematic screening for venous thrombosis with Duplex ultrasound reported a significantly higher incidence of venous thrombosis compared to those relying on clinical suspicion (56.3% vs. 11.0%, p < 0.001). Despite thromboprophylaxis, there is a very high incidence of thrombotic complications in patients with COVID-19 on the ICU. Systematic screening identifies many thrombotic complications that would be missed by relying on clinical suspicion and should be employed, with consideration given to increased dose anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis, whilst awaiting results of prospective trials of anticoagulation in this cohort."

Qualitative fibrinogen deficiencies (dysfibrinogenaemia and hypodysfibrinogenemia) are functional disorders that can present with both haemorrhagic symptoms and with thrombotic phenomena as unique and paradoxical manifestation. We present the case of a 77-year-old man being investigated for a partially thrombosed abdominal aortic aneurysm as well as an ischaemic stroke 20 years previously. Basic coagulation tests were normal but extended tests revealed a lengthened thrombin time (TT) combined with a significant drop in fibrinogen concentration measured with the Clauss assay and by nephelometry. After secondary fibrinogen deficiencies were ruled out, a heterozygous variant in the FGG gene was detected by next-generation sequencing, and congenital hypodysfibrinogenemia was diagnosed. Acenocumarol was initiated and no new thrombotic or haemorrhagic events had occurred after a year of follow-up. In almost 25% of cases, thrombotic events may be the only clinical manifestation of functional fibrinogen deficiencies. They are a rare cause of thrombophilia, and are probably underdiagnosed due to normal standard coagulation test results as well as a possible absence of haemorrhagic events. Consequently, a TT test (an initial 'rule out' test) should be requested in order to promptly identify these patients. Moreover, discrepancies in derived and Clauss fibrinogen test results should suggest a functional disorder. Finally, new coagulation techniques based on the functional characterization of clot formation, such as ROTEM or thrombin generation assay, could help characterize these entities and suggest new therapeutic approaches. LEARNING POINTS: Functional fibrinogen deficiencies can present with thrombotic manifestations only, and are a rare and probably underdiagnosed cause of thrombophilia.Thrombin time is a highly sensitive test to rule out other conditions as aPTT and PT results may be within normal ranges, especially in functional deficiencies.Discrepancies between derived and Clauss fibrinogen findings, fibrinogen protein measurements and the use of new techniques (ROTEM or thrombin generation) are important for correct approach."

After systematically reviewing the literature of (hypo-)dysfibrinogenemia patients with bleeding phenotypes, we identified several well-characterized bleeding-related fibrinogen variants in those patients. Several possible pathomechanisms are proposed to explain the genotype-phenotype associations: 1, mutations in the NH2-terminal portion of the Aalpha chain hamper fibrinogen fitting into the active site cleft of thrombin and drastically slow the conversion of fibrinogen into monomeric fibrin; 2, mutations adding new N-linked glycosylation sites introduce bulky and negatively charged carbohydrate side chains and undermine the alignment of fibrin monomers during polymerization; 3, mutations generating unpaired cysteine form extra disulfide bonds between the abnormal fibrinogen chains and produce highly branched and fragile fibrin networks; 4, truncation mutations in the fibrinogen alphaC regions impair the lateral fibril aggregation, as well as factor XIII crosslinking, endothelial cell and platelet binding. These established relationships between specific variants and the bleeding tendency will help manage (hypo-)dysfibrinogenemia patients to avoid adverse bleeding outcomes."

A mutant gene located on the BXSB Y chromosome, designated Yaa (Y chromosome-linked autoimmune acceleration), is responsible for the acceleration of the disease observed in male BXSB mice. Studies on H-2 congenic and I-E transgenic mice have clearly demonstrated that the MHC class II genes play a crucial role in the development or protection of SLE. However, the MHC effect can be completely masked by the presence of the Yaa gene in mice with certain genetic backgrounds. It is intriguing that the Yaa gene effect is selective on autoimmune responses, varying in different lupus-prone mice. Studies on immune responses against foreign antigens have shown that the Yaa gene potentiates immune responses only against antigens to which mice are genetically (H-2-linked) low-responding, but not high-responding. Thus, the selective immune enhancing activity of the Yaa gene may be related to differences in the capacity of T helper cells specific for given antigens. Moreover, studies on Yaa(+)-Yaa- bone marrow cell chimeric mice have suggested that a specific cognate interaction of T helper cells with Yaa+ B cells is responsible for a selective enhancing effect of immune responses to foreign antigens as well as autoantigens. It is significant that unlike the lpr mutation, whose abnormality is associated with the capacity of the Fas antigen to mediate apoptosis, the Yaa gene by itself is unable to induce significant autoimmune responses in mice without apparent SLE background. This suggests that the molecular defect of the Yaa gene is likely to differ from that of the lpr gene, and that the Yaa gene effect requires the abnormal autosomal genome present in lupus-prone mice. Based on these findings, a possible molecular nature of the Yaa gene abnormality will be discussed."

They can thereby inhibit the decay of labile transcripts by antagonizing destabilizing proteins that target these AU-rich sequences. Here we examine the sequence preferences of HuD to elucidate its possible role in counteracting mRNA decay. Using repeats of the prototype destabilizing sequence UU(AUUU)nAUU, we show that all three HuD RNA-binding domains participate in binding to AU-tracts that can be as short as 13 residues, depending on the position of the remaining As. Removal of the A residues, resulting in a poly(U)-tract, increased the affinity of HuD for RNA, suggesting that the presence of As in destabilizing elements might favor the recruitment of other proteins and/or prevent HuD from binding too tightly to AREs. In vitro selection experiments with randomized RNAs confirmed the preference of HuD for poly(U). RNA binding analysis of the related protein HuB showed a similar preference for poly(U). In contrast, tristetraprolin, an mRNA destabilizing protein, strongly prefers AU-rich RNA. Many labile mRNAs contain U-tracts in or near their AREs. Individual AREs may thus differentially affect mRNA half-life by recruiting a unique complement of stabilizing and destabilizing factors."

These channels are located in the lipid layer of cell membranes where they exist as water channels through which ion transport is performed. Based on the type of genetic disorder and clinical presentation, Bartter's syndrome is classified as neonatal, classical and Gitelman's syndrome. Most of the cases have been noted in pediatric age groups and adult-onset cases are very rare. Moreover, an association between Bartter's syndrome and empty sella has recently been reported in 3 children. We report here the second case of an adult patient affected by Bartter's syndrome with partial empty sella. The patient showed some clinical and histological characteristics of both classic Bartter's syndrome and Gitelman's syndrome, suggesting that genotype and phenotype of Bartter's syndrome are not so clear-cut and that phenotypic overlap may occur, according to a recent hypothesis. Magnetic resonance imaging disclosed a partial empty sella. A thorough endocrinological investigation showed normal hypophyseal, thyroidal, adrenal and gonadal function. Good therapeutic effects were achieved using spironolactone, ACE-inhibitor and potassium supplementation, with normalization of the kalemia. At present, the value of the association of Bartter's syndrome and empty sella remains unclear and future studies are needed to clarify the importance of this association, both in children and in adult patients affected by Bartter's syndrome."

Ribosomal protein S19 (RPS19), currently the only gene associated with DBA, is mutated in 25% of DBA patients, but its role in erythropoiesis is unknown. We attempted to elucidate the importance of RPS19 in translation in relation to the pathogenesis of DBA. DESIGN AND METHODS: We measured translation and proliferation rates in unstimulated and phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated lymphocytes isolated from DBA patients, as well as in K562 cells expressing several RPS19 mutants to directly test the effect of RPS19 mutations on translation. The effect of leucine on overall translation was also studied. RESULTS: We found that the level of translation was on average 48-73% of controls in both unstimulated and PHA-activated DBA lymphocytes irrespective of mutations in RPS19. The addition of leucine increased the translational level in RPS19-non-mutated DBA cells, but not in cells with an RPS19 mutation. In unstimulated DBA cells, proliferation was significantly impaired in both RPS19-mutated and non-mutated cells, but in both groups could be efficiently activated by PHA. Studies on K562 cells showed that RPS19 mutations affecting RPS19 conserved arginines R56Q and R62Q could significantly inhibit the rate of protein synthesis, indicating the importance of RPS19 in translation. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that inefficient translation may be the main cause of DBA, and administration of leucine may be beneficial for at least some DBA patients."

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association of p53 codon 72 genetic polymorphism and the p53 immunohistochemistry with Helicobacter pylori-associated gastroduodenal diseases, including gastric cancer. This study included 1,852 subjects: controls and patients with gastric cancer, dysplasia, benign gastric ulcers, and duodenal ulcers (DU). Biallelic polymorphism was genotyped by restriction fragment length polymorphism. Immunohistochemical analysis for the detection of mutant type p53 expression was performed. The frequency of the Pro/Pro allele of the p53 codon 72 was higher in the patients with H. pylori-positive dysplasia than in controls (OR: 2.3, 95% CI: 1.3-4.3), but it was less frequent among patients with a H. pylori-positive DU (OR: 0.5, 95% CI: 0.3-0.8). However, there was no significant association with gastric cancer, including the location, stage, or histological type of gastric cancer. Expression of a mutant type of p53 protein was detected in 6.3% of dysplastic tissues and 26.5% of cancerous tissues compared 0% in the controls. Positive expression was higher in the intestinal type of cancer (34.9%) than in the diffuse type (15.0%; P = 0.001). These results suggest that genetic polymorphism of p53 codon 72 played a role in the determination of H. pylori-associated gastroduodenal diseases, but p53 immunostaining did not correlate with those of the p53 genetic polymorphism analysis."

Our objective was to compare QOL in children with obstructive hydrocephalus, treated with either ETV or shunt. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted at SickKids, Toronto of children between ages five and 18 years, with obstructive hydrocephalus due to aqueductal obstruction and no other brain abnormalities. Measures of QOL were the Hydrocephalus Outcome Questionnaire and the Health Utilities Index Mark 3. A subset of patients was given the Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children (WISC-IV). RESULTS: A total of 47 of 59 (80%) eligible patients participated (24 had ETV as primary treatment, 23 had shunt as primary treatment), with a mean age of 12.1 years (standard deviation 3.9) at assessment. The ETV group was older at initial surgery (p < 0.001) and had larger ventricle size at last follow-up (p = 0.047). In all QOL measures, there were no significant differences between the ETV group and shunt group (all p > or = 0.09). Treatment failure, hydrocephalus complications, and the presence of a functioning ETV at assessment were not associated with QOL differences. Among the 11 children (six ETV, five shunt) who were given the WISC-IV, there were no significant differences between the scores of the ETV group and shunt group (all p > or = 0.11). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to provide a meaningful comparison of QOL after ETV and shunt in children. These preliminary results suggest that there is no obvious difference in QOL after ETV and shunt."

This study aims at identifying proteins regulating ERK1/2 activity, specifically in response to inflammatory cytokines, to provide new insights into mechanisms leading to abnormal adipose tissue function. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Kinase activities were inhibited with pharmacological inhibitors or siRNA. Lipolysis was monitored through glycerol production. Gene expression in adipocytes and adipose tissue of obese mice and subjects was measured by real-time PCR. RESULTS: IkappaB kinase-(IKK)-beta inhibition prevented mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase kinase (MEK)/ERK1/2 activation in response to interleukin (IL)-1beta and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha but not insulin in 3T3-L1 and human adipocytes, suggesting that IKKbeta regulated a MAP kinase kinase kinase (MAP3K) involved in ERK1/2 activation induced by inflammatory cytokines. We show that the MAP3K8 called Tpl2 was expressed in adipocytes and that IL-1beta and TNF-alpha activated Tpl2 and regulated its expression through an IKKbeta pathway. Pharmacological inhibition or silencing of Tpl2 prevented MEK/ERK1/2 activation by these cytokines but not by insulin, demonstrating its involvement in ERK1/2 activation specifically in response to inflammatory stimuli. Importantly, Tpl2 was implicated in cytokine-induced lipolysis and in insulin receptor substrate-1 serine phosphorylation. Tpl2 mRNA expression was upregulated in adipose tissue of obese mice and patients and correlated with TNF-alpha expression. CONCLUSIONS: Tpl2 is selectively involved in inflammatory cytokine-induced ERK1/2 activation in adipocytes and is implicated in their deleterious effects on adipocyte functions. The deregulated expression of Tpl2 in adipose tissue suggests that Tpl2 may be a new actor in adipose tissue dysfunction in obesity."

CCM1, CCM2, and CCM3 interact biochemically in a pathway required in endothelial cells during cardiovascular development in mice and zebrafish. The downstream effectors by which this signaling pathway regulates endothelial function have not yet been identified. Here we have shown in zebrafish that expression of mutant ccm3 proteins (ccm3Delta) known to cause cerebral cavernous malformation in humans confers cardiovascular phenotypes identical to those associated with loss of ccm1 and ccm2. CCM3Delta proteins interacted with CCM1 and CCM2, but not with other proteins known to bind wild-type CCM3, serine/threonine protein kinase MST4 (MST4), sterile 20-like serine/threonine kinase 24 (STK24), and STK25, all of which have poorly defined biological functions. Cardiovascular phenotypes characteristic of CCM deficiency arose due to stk deficiency and combined low-level deficiency of stks and ccm3 in zebrafish embryos. In cultured human endothelial cells, CCM3 and STK25 regulated barrier function in a manner similar to CCM2, and STKs negatively regulated Rho by directly activating moesin. These studies identify STKs as essential downstream effectors of CCM signaling in development and disease that may regulate both endothelial and epithelial cell junctions."

Bnip3 is also a potent inducer of autophagy in many cells. In this study, we have investigated the mechanism by which Bnip3 induces autophagy in adult cardiac myocytes. Overexpression of Bnip3 induced extensive autophagy in adult cardiac myocytes. Fluorescent microscopy studies and ultrastructural analysis revealed selective degradation of mitochondria by autophagy in myocytes overexpressing Bnip3. Oxidative stress and increased levels of intracellular Ca(2+) have been reported by others to induce autophagy, but Bnip3-induced autophagy was not abolished by antioxidant treatment or the Ca(2+) chelator BAPT A-AM. We also investigated the role of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) in Bnip3-induced autophagy. Although the mPTP has previously been implicated in the induction of autophagy and selective removal of damaged mitochondria by autophagosomes, mitochondria sequestered by autophagosomes in Bnip3-treated cardiac myocytes had not undergone permeability transition and treatment with the mPTP inhibitor cyclosporine A did not inhibit mitochondrial autophagy in cardiac myocytes. Moreover, cyclophilin D (cypD) is an essential component of the mPTP and Bnip3 induced autophagy to the same extent in embryonic fibroblasts isolated from wild-type and cypD-deficient mice. These results support a model where Bnip3 induces selective removal of the mitochondria in cardiac myocytes and that Bnip3 triggers induction of autophagy independent of Ca(2+), ROS generation, and mPTP opening."

The presence of 8 highly-conserved AU rich elements (AREs) within the 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR) of the TSP-1 mRNA suggests that post-transcriptional regulation is likely to represent one mechanism by which TSP-1 gene expression is regulated. We investigated the roles of these AREs, and proteins which bind to them, in the control of TSP-1 mRNA stability. The endogenous TSP-1 mRNA half-life is approximately 2.0 hours in HEK293 cells. Luciferase reporter mRNAs containing the TSP-1 3'UTR show a similar rate of decay, suggesting that the 3'UTR influences the decay rate. Site-directed mutagenesis of individual and adjacent AREs prolonged reporter mRNA halflife to between 2.2 and 4.4 hours. Mutation of all AREs increased mRNA half life to 8.8 hours, suggesting that all AREs have some effect, but that specific AREs may have key roles in stability regulation. A labeled RNA oligonucleotide derived from the most influential ARE was utilized to purify TSP-1 ARE-binding proteins. The AU-binding protein AUF1 was shown to associate with this motif. These studies reveal that AREs in the 3'UTR control TSP-1 mRNA stability and that the RNA binding protein AUF1 participates in this control. These studies suggest that ARE-dependent control of TSP-1 mRNA stability may represent an important component in the control of TSP-1 gene expression."

Cell proliferation ability was detected by colony formation assay. Cellular apoptosis was inspected by acridine orange-ethidium bromide fluorescent staining, Hoechst 33258 fluorescent staining, and flow cytometry (FCM) with annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide dual staining. The results showed that dracorhodin perchlorate inhibited the growth of PC-3 in a dose- and time-dependent manner. IC50 of dracorhodin perchlorate on PC-3 cells at 24 h was 40.18 mumol/L. Cell clone formation rate was decreased by 86% after treatment with 20 mumol/L of dracorhodin perchlorate. Some cells presented the characteristic apoptotic changes. The cellular apoptotic rates induced by 10-40 mumol/L dracorhodin perchlorate for 24 h were 8.43% to 47.71% respectively.

It was approved for treatment in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Recently, a generic sildenafil (Unison Laboratories, Thailand) was proved to have the same bioequivalent as in the original formula. The authors conducted a 12-week case series to study the efficacy and safety of Elonza (generic sildenafil) in PAH patients. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Comparison of both hemodynamic data from cardiac catheterization and clinical outcome such as six minute walk test (6MWT) were performed to assess the efficacy of generic sildenafil at the dosage of 50 mg given orally three times daily in patients with PAH over a 12 weeks period. RESULTS: There were 20 patients whose average age was 31.4 +/- 14.3 years old (13-58) and their average weight was 48.1 +/- 11.9 kg (31-79). There were three idiopathic pulmonary artery hypertensions (IPAH) and 17 congenital left to right shunts. There was a 15.1% decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance index (PVRi) from 20.5 +/- 13.9 to 17.4 +/- 2.9 Wood unit m2 at the end of 12 weeks (p = 0.044). The ratio of pulmonary to systemic vascular resistance (PVR/SVR) was also decreased from 0.71 +/- 0.57 to 0.52 +/- 0.41 (p = 0.014). 6MWT increased significantly from 271 +/- 59 meters (m) at baseline to 297 +/- 48 m, 307 +/- 43 m and 321 +/- 52 m at week 2, 6 and 12, respectively (p = 0.01). There was no significant change in other hemodynamic parameter, Borg dyspnea score, and functional class. CONCLUSION: At the end of the 12-week treatment, a 50 mg three times daily of generic sildenafil given to patients with PAH was shown to have benefit on decreasing PVRi, PVR/SVR ratio.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Three groups of patients with chronic continuous or chronic recurrent ulcerative colitis (UC) were formed according to the treatment option: 1) 15 patients with UC, in whom mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) were thrice administered for a month at a one-week interval; 2) 20 patients with UC who received MSC once; 3) 20 patients with UC who had standard anti-inflammatory therapy with 5-aminosalycilic acid (5-ASA) preparations and glucocorticosteroids (GCS). The clinical activity of UC was evaluated using the Rachmilewitz index; its endoscopic pattern was assessed with the Mayo index. UC histological specimens were scored using the Gebs scale. To ascertain the duration of remission, the authors used the Kaplan-Maier survival curve method and calculated relative risk (RR) and odds ratio with 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: Following 12 months, allogeneic bone marrow (BM) MSC transplantation performed thrice during a month caused the greatest reduction in the Rachmilewitz clinical activity index, Mayo endoscopic activity index, and Gebs pathohistological index in patients with UC as compared to those who had underwent one transplantation or received 5-ASA preparations and GCS (p < 0.05). The duration of remission also depended on the chosen therapy option for UC and the frequency of cell culture administration: the longer duration was recorded in patients who were infused thrice with allogeneic BM MSC. CONCLUSION: In the patients who had undergone one MSC administration, the risk of recurrent UC was higher than in those who had received MSC thrice during a month (a 2-year follow-up) and comparable with the RR of recurrent UC in the patient receiving only 5-ASA preparations, GCS, and/or immunosuppressants."

However, the arrhythmogenic role of CaMKII in stretched ventricle has not been well understood. OBJECTIVE: We tested abnormal impulse inducibility by stretch current in myocytes isolated from CaMKIIdelta knockout (KO) mouse left ventricle (LV) where CaMKII activity is reduced by   62%. METHODS AND RESULTS: Action potentials were recorded by whole-cell patch clamp, and abnormal impulses were induced in LV myocytes by a simulation of stretch-activated channel (SAC) current. SAC activation failed to induce abnormal impulses in wild type (WT) myocytes but steadily produced early after-depolarizations and automaticity in KO myocytes in which an increase in L-type calcium channel (LTCC) current (I(Ca)) and a reduction of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) leak and action potential duration (APD) were observed. The abnormal impulses were not suppressed by CaMKII inhibitor AIP whereas a low concentration of nifedipine eliminated abnormal impulses without shortening APD, implicating I(Ca) in promoting stretch-induced abnormal impulses. In addition, APD prolongation by LTCC opener S(-)Bay K 8644 or isoproterenol facilitated abnormal impulse induction in WT ventricular myocytes even in the presence of CaMKII inhibitor AIP, whereas APD prolongation by K(+) channel blocker 4-aminopyridine promoted abnormal impulses in KO myocytes but not in WT myocytes. CONCLUSION: I(Ca) activation plays a central role in stretch-induced abnormal impulses and APD prolongation is arrhythmogenic only when I(Ca) is highly activated. At increased I(Ca) activation, CaMKII inhibition cannot suppress abnormal impulse induction."

We aimed to determine the dose-response relation of siponimod in terms of its effects on brain MRI lesion activity and characterise safety and tolerability in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. METHODS: In this double-blind, adaptive dose-ranging phase 2 study, we enrolled adults (aged 18-55 years) with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis at 73 medical centres in Europe and North America. We tested two patient cohorts sequentially, separated by an interim analysis at 3 months. We randomly allocated patients in cohort 1 (1:1:1:1) to receive once-daily siponimod 10 mg, 2 mg, or 0 5 mg, or placebo for 6 months. We randomly allocated patients in cohort 2 (4:4:1) to siponimod 1 25 mg, siponimod 0 25 mg, or placebo once-daily for 3 months. Randomisation was done with a central, automated system and patients and investigators were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was dose-response, assessed by percentage reduction in monthly number of combined unique active lesions at 3 months for siponimod versus placebo; this endpoint was analysed by a multiple comparison procedure with modelling techniques in all patients with at least one MRI scan up to 3 months. We assessed safety in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00879658. FINDINGS: Between March 30, 2009, and Oct 22, 2010, we recruited 188 patients into cohort 1 and 109 patients into cohort 2. We showed a dose-response relation (p=0 0001) across the five doses of siponimod, with reductions in combined unique active lesions at 3 months compared with placebo of 35% (95% CI 17-57) for siponimod 0 25 mg (51 patients included in the primary endpoint analysis), 50% (29-69) for siponimod 0 5 mg (43 patients), 66% (48-80) for siponimod 1 25 mg (42 patients), 72% (57-84) for siponimod 2 mg (45 patients), and 82% (70-90) for siponimod 10 mg (44 patients). In patients treated for 6 months, 37 (86%) of 43 patients who received siponimod 0 5 mg had adverse events (eight serious), as did 48 (98%) of 49 patients who received siponimod 2 mg (four serious), 48 (96%) of 50 patients who received siponimod 10 mg (three serious), and 36 (80%) of 45 controls (none serious). For individuals treated to 3 months, 38 (74%) of 51 patients who received siponimod 0 25 mg had adverse events (none serious), as did 29 (69%) of 42 patients who received siponimod 1 25 mg (two serious) and 13 (81%) of 16 controls (none serious).

Sustained and excessive activation of CaMKII during cardiac disease has, however, been linked to arrhythmias, and maladaptive cardiac remodeling, eventually leading to heart failure (HF) and sudden cardiac death. AREAS COVERED: In the current review, the authors describe the unique structural and biochemical properties of CaMKII and focus on its physiological effects in cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, they provide evidence for a role of CaMKII in cardiac pathologies, including arrhythmogenesis, myocardial ischemia and HF development. The authors conclude by discussing the potential for CaMKII as a target for inhibition in heart disease. EXPERT OPINION: CaMKII provides a promising nodal point for intervention that may allow simultaneous prevention of HF progression and development of arrhythmias. For future studies and drug development there is a strong rationale for the development of more specific CaMKII inhibitors. In addition, an improved understanding of the differential roles of CaMKII subtypes is required."

IL-22 has also been shown to modulate cell cycle and proliferation mediators such as extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), but little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms of IL-22 in tumorigenesis. In this paper, we propose that IL-22 has a crucial role to play in controlling epithelial cell proliferation and tumorigenesis in the breast. IL-22 increased MAP3K8 phosphorylation through IL-22R1, followed by the induction of MEK-ERK, JNK-c-Jun, and STAT3 signaling pathways. Furthermore, IL-22-IL-22R1 signaling pathway activated activator protein-1 and HER2 promoter activity. In addition, Pin1 was identified as a key positive regulator for the phosphorylation-dependent MEK, c-Jun and STAT3 activity induced by IL-22. Pin1(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) exhibited significantly a decrease in IL-22-induced MEK1/2, c-Jun, and STAT3 phosphorylation compared with Pin1(+/+) MEF. In addition, a knockdown of Pin1 prevented phosphorylation induced by IL-22. The in vivo chorioallantoic membrane assay also showed that IL-22 increased tumor formation of JB6 Cl41 cells. Moreover, the knockdown of MAP3K8 and Pin1 attenuated tumorigenicity of MCF7 cells. Consistent with these observations, IL-22 levels positively correlate with MAP3K8 and Pin1 expression in human breast cancer. Overall, our findings point to a critical role for the IL-22-induced MAP3K8 signaling pathway in promoting cancer-associated inflammation in the tumor microenvironment."

        "text": "Tousled-like kinases phosphorylate Asf1 to promote histone supply during DNA replication.\nDuring DNA replication, nucleosomes are rapidly assembled on newly synthesized DNA to restore chromatin organization. Asf1, a key histone H3-H4 chaperone required for this process, is phosphorylated by Tousled-like kinases (TLKs). Here, we identify TLK phosphorylation sites by mass spectrometry and dissect how phosphorylation has an impact on human Asf1 function. The divergent C-terminal tail of Asf1a is phosphorylated at several sites, and this is required for timely progression through S phase. Consistent with this, biochemical analysis of wild-type and phospho-mimetic Asf1a shows that phosphorylation enhances binding to histones and the downstream chaperones CAF-1 and HIRA. Moreover, we find that TLK phosphorylation of Asf1a is induced in cells experiencing deficiency of new histones and that TLK interaction with Asf1a involves its histone-binding pocket. We thus propose that TLK signalling promotes histone supply in S phase by targeting histone-free Asf1 and stimulating its ability to shuttle histones to sites of chromatin assembly. "

In the present study, we studied the cellular mechanism of dexamethasone (Dex)-induce osteoblast cell death by focusing on the role of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP). In cultured osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells, Dex-induced mPTP opening, which was demonstrated by mitochondrial membrane potential (MPP) decrease, cyclophilin-D (CyPD)-adenine nucleotide translocator 1 (ANT-1) mitochondrial complexation and cytochrome C (cyto-C) release. The mPTP inhibitor sanglifehrin A (SfA) dramatically inhibited Dex-induced MPP loss, cyto-C release and MC3T3-E1 cell death. Dex-induced cell death requires mPTP composing protein CyPD, as CyPD inhibitor cyclosporin A (CsA) and CyPD siRNA knockdown inhibited Dex-induced MC3T3-E1 cell death, while CyPD overexpression aggravated Dex's cytotoxic effect. We found that Dex induced P53 phosphorylation and translocation to mitochondria, where it formed a complex with CyPD. Glucocorticoid receptor (GR) siRNA knockdown, or P53 inhibition (by its inhibitor pifithrin-alpha or shRNA silencing) suppressed Dex-induced CyPD-P53 mitochondrial association and subsequent MC3T3-E1 cell death. Finally, in primary cultured osteoblasts, Dex-induced cell death was inhibited by CsA, SfA or pifithrin-alpha. Together, our data suggest that Dex-induced osteoblast cell death is associated with GR-P53-regulated mPTP opening."

        "text": "Posttranscriptional control of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 expression in cancer cells.\nCXCR4 is a chemokine receptor that is overexpressed in certain cancer types and involved in migration toward distant organs. The molecular mechanisms underlying CXCR4 expression in invasive cancer, particularly posttranscriptional regulation, are poorly understood. Here, we find that CXCR4 harbors AU-rich elements (AREs) in the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) that bind and respond to the RNA-binding proteins, tristetraprolin (TTP/ZFP36) and HuR (ELAVL1). Different experimental approaches, including RNA immunoprecipitation, 3'-UTR reporter, RNA shift and messenger RNA (mRNA) half-life studies confirmed functionality of the CXCR4 ARE. Wild-type TTP, but not the zinc finger mutant, C124R, was able to bind CXCR4 mRNA and ARE. In the invasive breast cancer phenotype, aberrant expression of CXCR4 is linked to both TTP deficiency and HuR overexpression. HuR silencing led to decreased CXCR4 mRNA stability and expression, and significant reduction in migration of the cells toward the CXCR4 ligand, CXCL12. Derepression of TTP using miR-29a inhibitor led to significant reduction in CXCR4 mRNA stability, expression and migration capability of the cells. The study shows that CXCR4 is regulated by ARE-dependent posttranscriptional mechanisms that involve TTP and HuR, and that aberration in this pathway helps cancer cells migrate toward the CXCR4 ligand. Targeting posttranscriptional control of CXCR4 expression may constitute an alternative approach in cancer therapy. "

To resolve this controversy, we have applied H4S47C-anchored cleavage mapping, which reveals the precise position of histone H4 in every nucleosome in the genome. We find that cleavage patterns at centromeres are unique within the genome and are incompatible with symmetrical structures, including octameric nucleosomes and (Cse4/H4)2 tetrasomes. Centromere cleavage patterns are compatible with a precisely positioned core structure, one in which each of the 16 yeast centromeres is occupied by oppositely oriented Cse4/H4/H2A/H2B hemisomes in two rotational phases within the population. Centromere-specific hemisomes are also inferred from distances observed between closely-spaced H4 cleavages, as predicted from structural modeling. Our results indicate that the orientation and rotational position of the stable hemisome at each yeast centromere is not specified by the functional centromere sequence.

The present study aims to validate these findings in an independent cohort of pediatric GBM, compare it with adult GBM, and evaluate the involvement of important functionally altered pathways. METHODS: Genome-wide methylation profiling of 21 pediatric GBM cases was done and compared with adult GBM data (GSE22867). We performed gene mutation analysis of IDH1 and H3 histone family 3A (H3F3A), status evaluation of glioma cytosine-phosphate-guanine island methylator phenotype (G-CIMP), and Gene Ontology analysis. Experimental evaluation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) association was also done. RESULTS: Distinct differences were noted between methylomes of pediatric and adult GBM. Pediatric GBM was characterized by 94 hypermethylated and 1206 hypomethylated cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) islands, with 3 distinct clusters, having a trend to prognostic correlation. Interestingly, none of the pediatric GBM cases showed G-CIMP/IDH1 mutation. Gene Ontology analysis identified ROS association in pediatric GBM, which was experimentally validated. H3F3A mutants (36.4%; all K27M) harbored distinct methylomes and showed enrichment of processes related to neuronal development, differentiation, and cell-fate commitment. CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms that pediatric GBM has a distinct methylome compared with that of adults. Presence of distinct clusters and an H3F3A mutation-specific methylome indicate existence of epigenetic subgroups within pediatric GBM. Absence of IDH1/G-CIMP status further indicates that findings in adult GBM cannot be simply extrapolated to pediatric GBM and that there is a strong need for identification of separate prognostic markers. A possible role of ROS in pediatric GBM pathogenesis is demonstrated for the first time and needs further evaluation."

Numerous studies have demonstrated that curcumin possesses anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anticancerous properties. The purpose of this review is to focus on the anti-tumor effects of curcumin. Curcumin inhibits the STAT3 and NF-kappaB signaling pathways, which play key-roles in cancer development and progression. Also, inhibition of Sp-1 and its housekeeping gene expressions may serve as an important hypothesis to prevent cancer formation, migration, and invasion. Recent data have suggested that curcumin may act by suppressing the Sp-1 activation and its downstream genes, including ADEM10, calmodulin, EPHB2, HDAC4, and SEPP1 in a concentration-dependent manner in colorectal cancer cell lines; these results are consistent with other studies, which have reported that curcumin could suppress the Sp-1 activity in bladder cancer and could decrease DNA binding activity of Sp-1 in non-small cell lung carcinoma cells. Recent data advocate that ER stress and autophagy may as well play a role in the apoptosis process, which is induced by the curcumin analogue B19 in an epithelial ovarian tumor cell line and that autophagy inhibition could increase curcumin analogue-induced apoptosis by inducing severe ER stress. The ability of curcumin to induce apoptosis in tumor cells and its anti-angiogenic potential will be discussed in this review."

Several forms of the disease have been described, and the most common is the sporadic type. The most challenging aspect of this disease is its diagnosis-the gold standard for definitive diagnosis is considered to be histopathological confirmation-but newer tests are providing means for an antemortem diagnosis in ways less invasive than brain biopsy. Imaging studies, electroencephalography, and biomarkers are used in conjunction with the clinical picture to try to make the diagnosis of CJD without brain tissue samples, and all of these are reviewed in this article. The current diagnostic criteria are limited; test sensitivity and specificity varies with the genetics of the disease as well as the clinical stage. Physicians may be unsure of all diagnostic testing available, and may order outdated tests or prematurely request a brain biopsy when the diagnostic workup is incomplete. The authors review CJD, discuss the role of brain biopsy in this patient population, provide a diagnostic pathway for the patient presenting with rapidly progressive dementia, and propose newer diagnostic criteria."

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This study included 109 patients with UC. Based on the disease extent, patients were divided into two groups as left-sided colitis and pancolitis. Patients were grouped as inactive, mild, moderate and severe depending on the Rachmilewitz EAI and Harpaz HSS. Kendal's tau and kappa (x03BA;) statistics were used to assess the agreement between endoscopic and histopathological scores. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was also analyzed to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of endoscopic scores to predict inactive histopathological disease. RESULTS: In the left-sided colitis group, there were slight and poor agreements in the inactive endoscopic subscores (ESS) with inactive Harpaz HSS (x03BA;: 0.598, p < 0.001) and moderate ESS with moderate Harpaz HSS (x03BA;: 0.236, p = 0.046). There was no agreement between mild ESS and mild Harpaz HSS and between severe ESS and severe Harpaz HSS (x03BA;: 0.071, p = 0.573 and x03BA;: 0.160, p = 0.151, respectively). In the pancolitis group, there was no significant agreement between inactive, mild, moderate and severe ESS and the equivalent Harpaz HSS grades (x03BA;: -0.194, p = 0.187; x03BA;: 0.125, p = 0.397; x03BA;: 0.148, p = 0.175 and x03BA;: 0.174, p = 0.153, respectively). The ROC curve showed that the ESS indicating inactive disease had a low sensitivity to predict histologically inactive disease. CONCLUSION: The concordance between the endoscopic and histopathological indices was poor. Using both scores in the follow-up of patients with UC is necessary for treatment planning."

The aim of our study is to validate perioperative evidence of intimal entry tear in patients with IMH and to suggest that this entity may represent a part of a disease and not a separate disease. PRESENTATION OF CASES: We report two patients admitted to our institution with sudden onset thoracic pain. A CT scan showed an aneurysm of the ascending aorta complicated by type A IMH. The patients underwent open operation. Surgical set-up has included right axillary artery as arterial inflow, no cross-clamp before hypothermic circulatory arrest and Kazui protocol for selective antegrade cerebral perfusion. We found no evidence of intimal flap, but we identified an intimal tear in both patients. A hemiarch procedure associated with root replacement, using two-grafts techniques was performed in both cases. The postoperative course was uneventful and the patients were discharged home. DISCUSSION: Recent data are emerging from the radiologic literature about the evidence of intimal lesions in IMH, but surgical reports are scant. The evidence of intimal tears contributes to consider as questionable the etiological role of vasa vasorum and it may justify updates in the management.

The incidence of mucormycosis is approximately 1.7 cases per 1,000,000 inhabitants per year. Mucormycosis affecting the maxilla is rare because of rich blood vessel supply of maxillofacial areas although more virulent fungi such as Mucor can overcome this difficulty.

Evidence from pathogenesis studies suggests the involvement of complement-mediated peripheral nerve damage. We aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of eculizumab, a humanised monoclonal antibody against the complement protein C5, in patients with severe Guillain-Barre syndrome. METHODS: This study was a 24 week, multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised phase 2 trial done at 13 hospitals in Japan. Eligible patients with Guillain-Barre syndrome were aged 18 years or older and could not walk independently (Guillain-Barre syndrome functional grade 3-5). Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive 4 weeks of intravenous immunoglobulin plus either eculizumab (900 mg) or placebo; randomisation was done via a computer-generated process and web response system with minimisation for functional grade and age. The study had a parallel non-comparative single-arm outcome measure. The primary outcomes were efficacy (the proportion of patients with restored ability to walk independently [functional grade <=2] at week 4) in the eculizumab group and safety in the full analysis set. For the efficacy endpoint, we predefined a response rate threshold of the lower 90% CI boundary exceeding 50%. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number, NCT02493725. FINDINGS: Between Aug 10, 2015, and April 21, 2016, 34 patients were assigned to receive either eculizumab (n=23) or placebo (n=11). At week 4, the proportion of the patients able to walk independently (functional grade <=2) was 61% (90% CI 42-78; n=14) in the eculizumab group, and 45% (20-73; n=5) in the placebo group. Adverse events occurred in all 34 patients. Three patients had serious adverse events: two in the eculizumab group (anaphylaxis in one patient and intracranial haemorrhage and abscess in another patient) and one in the placebo group (depression). The possibility that anaphylaxis and intracranial abscess were related to eculizumab could not be excluded. No deaths or meningococcal infections occurred. INTERPRETATION: The primary outcome measure did not reach the predefined response rate. However, because this is a small study without statistical comparison with the placebo group, the efficacy and safety of eculizumab could be investigated in larger, randomised controlled trials.

Our purpose was to assess thrombotic risk in severe forms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: All patients referred to 4 intensive care units (ICUs) from two centers of a French tertiary hospital for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to COVID-19 between March 3rd and 31st 2020 were included. Medical history, symptoms, biological data and imaging were prospectively collected. Propensity score matching was performed to analyze the occurrence of thromboembolic events between non-COVID-19 ARDS and COVID-19 ARDS patients. RESULTS: 150 COVID-19 patients were included (122 men, median age 63 [53; 71] years, SAPSII 49 [37; 64] points). Sixty-four clinically relevant thrombotic complications were diagnosed in 150 patients, mainly pulmonary embolisms (16.7%). 28/29 patients (96.6%) receiving continuous renal replacement therapy experienced circuit clotting. Three thrombotic occlusions (in 2 patients) of centrifugal pump occurred in 12 patients (8%) supported by ECMO. Most patients (> 95%) had elevated D-dimer and fibrinogen. No patient developed disseminated intravascular coagulation. Von Willebrand (vWF) activity, vWF antigen and FVIII were considerably increased, and 50/57 tested patients (87.7%) had positive lupus anticoagulant. Comparison with non-COVID-19 ARDS patients (n = 145) confirmed that COVID-19 ARDS patients (n = 77) developed significantly more thrombotic complications, mainly pulmonary embolisms (11.7 vs. 2.1%, p < 0.008). Coagulation parameters significantly differed between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Despite anticoagulation, a high number of patients with ARDS secondary to COVID-19 developed life-threatening thrombotic complications.

Zebrafish have three neural crest-derived pigment cell types, black melanocytes, light-reflecting iridophores and yellow xanthophores, which offer a powerful model for studying the molecular and cellular mechanisms of fate segregation. Mitfa has been identified as the master regulator of melanocyte fate. Here, we show that an Mitf-related transcription factor, Tfec, functions as master regulator of the iridophore fate. Surprisingly, our phenotypic analysis of tfec mutants demonstrates that Tfec also functions in the initial specification of all three pigment cell-types, although the melanocyte and xanthophore lineages recover later. We show that Mitfa represses tfec expression, revealing a likely mechanism contributing to the decision between melanocyte and iridophore fate. Our data are consistent with the long-standing proposal of a tripotent progenitor restricted to pigment cell fates. Moreover, we investigate activation, maintenance and function of tfec in multipotent NCSCs, demonstrating for the first time its role in the gene regulatory network forming and maintaining early neural crest cells. In summary, we build on our previous work to characterise the gene regulatory network governing iridophore development, establishing Tfec as the master regulator driving iridophore specification from multipotent progenitors, while shedding light on possible cellular mechanisms of progressive fate restriction."

        "text": "How does epigenetics influence the course of evolution?\nEpigenetics is the study of changes in gene activity that can be transmitted through cell divisions but cannot be explained by changes in the DNA sequence. Epigenetic mechanisms are central to gene regulation, phenotypic plasticity, development and the preservation of genome integrity. Epigenetic mechanisms are often held to make a minor contribution to evolutionary change because epigenetic states are typically erased and reset at every generation, and are therefore, not heritable. Nonetheless, there is growing appreciation that epigenetic variation makes direct and indirect contributions to evolutionary processes. First, some epigenetic states are transmitted intergenerationally and affect the phenotype of offspring. Moreover, bona fide heritable 'epialleles' exist and are quite common in plants. Such epialleles could, therefore, be subject to natural selection in the same way as conventional DNA sequence-based alleles. Second, epigenetic variation enhances phenotypic plasticity and phenotypic variance and thus can modulate the effect of natural selection on sequence-based genetic variation. Third, given that phenotypic plasticity is central to the adaptability of organisms, epigenetic mechanisms that generate plasticity and acclimation are important to consider in evolutionary theory. Fourth, some genes are under selection to be 'imprinted' identifying the sex of the parent from which they were derived, leading to parent-of-origin-dependent gene expression and effects. These effects can generate hybrid disfunction and contribute to speciation. Finally, epigenetic processes, particularly DNA methylation, contribute directly to DNA sequence evolution, because they act as mutagens on the one hand and modulate genome stability on the other by keeping transposable elements in check. This article is part of the theme issue 'How does epigenetics influence the course of evolution?'"

It is caused by fungi of the family Mucoraceae. We present a case series of 61 patients diagnosed and treated for rhinocerebral mucormycosis (RCM) at a single tertiary health care center. Methods: After obtaining ethical clearance, all patient files with a final diagnosis of RCM were thoroughly analyzed in departmental records and a master chart was prepared. The study evaluated the etiology, clinical spectrum, diagnosis, management, complications, and outcome at 3 months of RCM cases. Results: About 93.4% of the RCM cases were diabetic and an equal number had a past history of COVID infection. About 85.2% had received steroids for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 infection. The most common presentation of RCM was temporal lobe abscess (25.7%) followed by frontal lobe abscess (16.6%). At 3 months post-diagnosis, mortality in our study was 42.6%. About 26.2 % of the RCM cases had no disease, 23% had a static disease, and 8.2% had progressive disease at the end of 3 months. Conclusion: We report the largest single-center case series of RCM, comprising 61 patients. This case series underscores the importance of the early diagnosis and prompt treatment for a better prognosis for this dreadful disease. The three pillars of treatment for RCM cases include reversal of the immunosuppressive state, administration of antifungal drugs, and extensive surgical debridement. In spite of all this, mortality remains high."

Whether treatment with intravenous teplizumab in patients with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes can prevent disease progression is unknown. METHODS: In this phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, we assessed beta-cell preservation, clinical end points, and safety in children and adolescents who were assigned to receive teplizumab or placebo for two 12-day courses. The primary end point was the change from baseline in beta-cell function, as measured by stimulated C-peptide levels at week 78. The key secondary end points were the insulin doses that were required to meet glycemic goals, glycated hemoglobin levels, time in the target glucose range, and clinically important hypoglycemic events. RESULTS: Patients treated with teplizumab (217 patients) had significantly higher stimulated C-peptide levels than patients receiving placebo (111 patients) at week 78 (least-squares mean difference, 0.13 pmol per milliliter; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.09 to 0.17; P<0.001), and 94.9% (95% CI, 89.5 to 97.6) of patients treated with teplizumab maintained a clinically meaningful peak C-peptide level of 0.2 pmol per milliliter or greater, as compared with 79.2% (95% CI, 67.7 to 87.4) of those receiving placebo. The groups did not differ significantly with regard to the key secondary end points. Adverse events occurred primarily in association with administration of teplizumab or placebo and included headache, gastrointestinal symptoms, rash, lymphopenia, and mild cytokine release syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Two 12-day courses of teplizumab in children and adolescents with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes showed benefit with respect to the primary end point of preservation of beta-cell function, but no significant differences between the groups were observed with respect to the secondary end points.

Fifteen fetal and newborn choroid plexuses were also examined by light microscopy. Calcium deposition was observed in the subepithelial regions of the adult choroid plexus, in the walls of blood vessels but was mostly seen in spherical psammoma bodies. Collagen whorls 20-60 microns in diameter and surrounded by arachnoid cells, were observed in the stroma of the choroid plexus; calcium, phosphorous and iron were deposited in the collagen whorls to form psammoma bodies. Matrix vesicles and spicules resembling hydroxyapatite were associated with the arachnoid cells surrounding the collagen whorls and with the collagen fibres within the whorls. The dense amorphous calcified core of each psammoma body was surrounded by an outer coating of entwined collagen fibres readily visible by scanning electron microscopy. Similar psammoma bodies were occasionally observed in normal arachnoid. Psammoma bodies in meningiomas resembled those in the choroid plexus stroma. Calcospherites in the pineal differed from psammoma bodies; they were lobulated, more irregular in shape and did not have a collagen base. The results of this study suggest that psammoma bodies in the choroid plexus, as in meningiomas, form by a process of dystrophic calcification associated with arachnoid cells and collagen fibres. The presence of iron in the choroid plexus psammoma bodies may be a result of haemorrhage into the stroma. The mechanism of calcification in pineal remains unclear."

The resultant cytotoxicity was assessed by tetrazolium (MTT) reduction 24 h later. AlPc was found to be 400, 10,000 and 250 times more potent that AlS2Pc, AlS4Pc and HpD, respectively, as an in vitro photosensitizing agent for meningioma cells. The subcellular localisation of AlPc, AlS2Pc, AlS4Pc and HpD in meningioma cells was determined by confocal laser scanning microscopy. None of the agents localized to the nucleus. The distribution of ALPc was quite diffuse through the cytoplasm. In contrast, AlS2Pc and AlS4Pc were localized vesicles suggestive of lysosomes, and HpD in membranous organelles distinct from mitochondria. AlPc and HpD were tested with five different meningioma samples and provided a range of IC50 values from 0.009 to 0.022 OM and from 3.5 to 6.5 OM, respectively. When the MTT assay with AlPc was performed 0, 24, 48 and 72 h after illumination, the mean IC50 values were 0.25, 0.037, 0.019 and 0.012 OM, respectively, indicating that the cytotoxic effect continued to increase up to 72 h. Cells were incubated with AlPc and HpD for different times up to 24 h before exposure to light. AlPc cytotoxicity was half-maximal with an incubation time of 8 h, whereas HpD cytotoxicity was half-maximal with an incubation time of 2 h, implying slower uptake kinetics for AlPc than for HpD. These data indicate unique features of AlPc which suggests its application as a potent, non-toxic photosensitizer in the photodynamic therapy of human meningiomas."

To identify whether oligomeric interactions between PLB molecules are involved in regulating Ca-ATPase transport activity, we have investigated functional interactions between PLB and the Ca-ATPase in proteoliposomes of purified PLB functionally co-reconstituted with the SERCA2a isoform of the Ca-ATPase isolated from cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). The calcium sensitivity of this reconstituted preparation and functional stimulation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) are virtually identical to those of the Ca-ATPase in cardiac SR microsomes, ensuring the functional relevance of this reconstituted preparation. Interactions between PLB molecules were measured following covalent modification of the single lysine (i.e., Lys(3)) in PLB isolated from cardiac SR membranes with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) prior to co-reconstitution with the Ca-ATPase. FITC modification of PLB does not interfere with the ability of PLB to inhibit the Ca-ATPase, since FITC-PLB co-reconstituted with the Ca-ATPase exhibits a similar calcium dependence of Ca-ATPase activation to that observed in native SR membranes. Thus, the functional arrangement of PLB with the Ca-ATPase is not modified by FITC modification. Using changes in the anisotropy of FITC-PLB resulting from fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between proximal PLB molecules to measure the average size and spatial arrangement of FITC chromophores, we find that PLB self-associates to form oligomers whose spatial arrangement with respect to one another is in agreement with earlier suggestions that PLB exists predominantly as a homopentamer. The inability of PKA to activate PLB following covalent modification with FITC permits functional interactions between PLB molecules associated with the Ca-ATPase activation to be identified. A second-order loss of Ca-ATPase activation by PKA is observed as a function of the fractional contribution of FITC-PLB, indicating that PKA-dependent activation of two PLB molecules within a quaternary complex containing the Ca-ATPase is necessary for activation of the Ca-ATPase. We suggest that the requirement for activation of two PLB molecules by PKA represents a physiological mechanism to ensure that activation of the Ca-ATPase following beta-adrenergic stimulation in the heart only occurs above a threshold level of PKA activation."

This basic-helix-loop-helix-leucine-zipper (bHLHzip) protein is critical for melanocyte cell-fate choice during commitment from pluripotent precursor cells in the neural crest. Its role in differentiation pathways has been highlighted by its potent transcriptional and lineage-specific regulation of the three major pigment enzymes: tyrosinase, Tyrp1, and Dct as well as other pigmentation factors. However, the cellular functions of MITF seem to be wider than differentiation and cell-fate pathways alone, since melanocytes and melanoma cells appear to require an expression of this factor. Here, we discuss the transcriptional networks in which MITF is thought to reside and describe signaling pathways in the cell which impinge on MITF. Accumulating evidence supports the notion that MITF is involved in survival pathways during normal development as well as during neoplastic growth of melanoma."

Specific RNA motifs likely regulate various aspects of this replication. Viroids of the Pospiviroidae family, as represented by the Potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTVd), replicate in the nucleus by utilizing DNA-dependent RNA polymerase II. We investigated the role of the loop E (sarcin/ricin) motif of the PSTVd genomic RNA in replication. A tertiary-structural model of this motif, inferred by comparative sequence analysis and comparison with nuclear magnetic resonance and X-ray crystal structures of loop E motifs in other RNAs, is presented in which core non-Watson-Crick base pairs are precisely specified. Isostericity matrix analysis of these base pairs showed that the model accounts for the reported natural sequence variations and viable experimental mutations in loop E motifs of PSTVd and other viroids. Furthermore, isostericity matrix analysis allowed us to design disruptive, as well as compensatory, mutations of PSTVd loop E. Functional analyses of such mutants by in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that loop E structural integrity is crucial for replication, specifically during transcription. Our results suggest that the PSTVd loop E motif exists and functions in vivo and provide loss-of-function genetic evidence for the essential role of a viroid RNA three-dimensional motif in rolling-circle replication. The use of isostericity matrix analysis of non-Watson-Crick base pairing to rationalize mutagenesis of tertiary motifs and systematic in vitro and in vivo functional assays of mutants offers a novel, comprehensive approach to elucidate the tertiary-structure-function relationships for RNA motifs of general biological significance."

Approximately 15% of genes in the worm are clustered into groups of between two and eight genes, which are under the control of shared regulatory sequences. Polycistronic transcripts from such operons are trans-spliced, during transcription, to produce mature monocistronic messengers. The C. elegans frataxin gene, frh-1, is encoded in the operon CEOP2232. This is one of the largest operons identified thus far in the C. elegans genome. Here we describe in detail the structure of all of the coding units within this operon. The operon is composed of eight genes of a diverse nature, organized in a complex structure. We have produced transgenic strains carrying fusions between gfp and a number of genes from the operon. These constructs show complex differential expression patterns that suggest the presence of internal promoters and regulatory sequences in the operon. This organization would permit both coordinated expression and differential expression of the components of the CEOP2232 operon. The heterogeneity of the genes, and their complex expression patterns, suggests that the clustering of CEOP2232 is not due to a need for synchronized expression of genes involved in the same physiological pathway."

An emerging paradigm is the presence of a succession of distinct conformational states, which are stabilized by an intricate network of interactions. Recent data suggest that even subtle changes in the composition of the interaction network can result in interconversion of the different conformational states, providing opportunities for regulation and proofreading of spliceosome function. Significant progress in proteomics has elucidated the protein composition of the spliceosome at different stages of assembly. Also, the increased sophistication and resolution of cryo-electron microscopy techniques, combined with high-resolution structural studies on a smaller scale, promise to create detailed images of the global structure of the spliceosome and its main components, which in turn will provide a plethora of mechanistic insights.

Basically, this process is directed by changes in two different classes of genes: Tumor suppressor genes that inhibit cell growth and survival and oncogenes that promote cell growth and survival. Since several alterations are usually required for a cancer to fully develop, the malignant phenotype is determined by the compound status of tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes. Cancer genes may be changed by several mechanisms, which potentially alter the protein encoding nucleotide template, change the copy number of genes, or lead to increased gene transcription. Epigenetic alterations, which, by definition, comprise mitotically and meiotically heritable changes in gene expression that are not caused by changes in the primary DNA sequence, are increasingly being recognized for their roles in carcinogenesis. These epigenetic alterations may involve covalent modifications of amino acid residues in the histones around which the DNA is wrapped, and changes in the methylation status of cytosine bases (C) in the context of CpG dinucleotides within the DNA itself. Methylation of clusters of CpGs called \"CpG-islands\" in the promoters of genes has been associated with heritable gene silencing. The present review will focus on how disruption of the epigenome can contribute to cancer. In contrast to genetic alterations, gene silencing by epigenetic modifications is potentially reversible. Treatment by agents that inhibit cytosine methylation and histone deacetylation can initiate chromatin decondensation, demethylation and reestablishment of gene transcription. Accordingly, in the clinical setting, DNA methylation and histone modifications are very attractive targets for the development and implementation of new therapeutic approaches. Many clinical trials are ongoing, and epigenetic therapy has recently been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) for use in the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and primary cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL)."

Here we describe a computational method to study the transmembrane (TM) domains of beta-barrel membrane proteins. Our method is based on a physical interaction model, a simplified conformational space for efficient enumeration, and an empirical potential function from a detailed combinatorial analysis. Using this method, we can identify weakly stable regions in the TM domain, which are found to be important structural determinants for beta-barrel membrane proteins. By calculating the melting temperatures of the TM strands, our method can also assess the stability of beta-barrel membrane proteins. Predictions on membrane enzyme PagP are consistent with recent experimental NMR and mutant studies. We have also discovered that out-clamps, in-plugs, and oligomerization are 3 general mechanisms for stabilizing weakly stable TM regions. In addition, we have found that extended and contiguous weakly stable regions often signal the existence of an oligomer and that strands located in the interfaces of protein-protein interactions are considerably less stable. Based on these observations, we can predict oligomerization states and can identify the interfaces of protein-protein interactions for beta-barrel membrane proteins by using either structure or sequence information. In a set of 25 nonhomologous proteins with known structures, our method successfully predicted whether a protein forms a monomer or an oligomer with 91% accuracy; in addition, our method identified with 82% accuracy the protein-protein interaction interfaces by using sequence information only when correct strands are given."

Ubiquitin conjugation was originally described to target proteins to proteasomal degradation by ubiquitin polymerization involving lysine (K) 48 residues. Differently linked polymers of polyubiquitin have been found that modify proteins without targeting to proteasomal degradation. Instead this pathway creates docking sites for signaling scaffolds that are key to control the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) pathway. Indeed TRAF-2, TRAF-6, and TRAF-3 are E3 ubiquitin ligases that form K63-linked ubiquitin polymers. Therefore signaling via TNF family receptors, IL1R, IL-18R, T-cell receptor (TCR), and Toll-like receptors (TLR) use this type of post-translational modification. Specific enzymes exist (DUBs) that deactivate this system, degrading K63 polyubiquitin chains. Interestingly, mice deficient in these deubiquitinases develop autoimmunity and inflammation. In carcinogenesis, the K63 polyubiquitin pathway is possibly critical for inflammation-driven tumor promotion. The pathway is also critically involved in costimulation of tumor immunity/immunotherapy as well as in the biology of malignant cells themselves.

Prolactinoma in old people may present insidiously with chronic anaemia and osteoporosis with or without sexual dysfunction. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe the case of a 70-year-old Caucasian man who presented with mild anaemia and tiredness. His anaemia was investigated and ascribed to senescence. Endocrine causes were not considered or tested for. Six years later, he was again referred. Reassessment and direct questioning revealed long-standing sexual dysfunction. It was also discovered that our patient had fractured his radius twice, with minor trauma, during the preceding year. His serum prolactin was massively increased and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the head demonstrated a pituitary mass consistent with a prolactinoma. Dual X-ray absorptiometry revealed osteoporosis. Treatment of the prolactinoma led to a reduction in his serum prolactin with a rise in his haemoglobin to normal levels. This suggested that the prolactinoma was present during the initial presentation and was the cause of his anaemia. CONCLUSION: This case highlights the importance of fully evaluating and investigating unexplained anaemia in older people and that endocrine causes should be considered.

Accumulation of PpIX in benign meningioma cells has been observed previously, its exploitation for PDT, however, was discouraged by inconsistent results. To evaluate PDT for benign meningiomas, we investigated PpIX synthesis in two human meningioma cell lines (HBL-52 and BEN-MEN-1), their respective extracellular loss of PpIX and corresponding ferrochelatase (FECH) activity as well as their susceptibility to PDT. We demonstrated PpIX production after 5-ALA administration and minor loss to the extracellular space in both cell lines. However, significantly more (up to five times) PpIX was accumulated in BEN-MEN-1 as compared with HBL-52 cells. FECH activity was 2.7-fold higher in HBL-52 compared with BEN-MEN-1 cells and accordingly higher FECH levels could be shown in HBL-52 cells by Western blot analysis. BEN-MEN-1 cells were much more sensitive to PDT and cells could be almost completely killed by irradiation doses of 2 J cm(-2) , whereas HBL-52 showed only an insufficient response at this irradiation dose. We conclude that differences in intracellular PpIX concentrations between HBL-52 and BEN-MEN-1 benign meningioma cells were mainly due to differences in FECH activity and that these differences correspond to their susceptibility to 5-ALA-induced PDT."

Three novel propensity scales namely, BTMC, BTMI and HTMI were derived for the TMB residues at the hydrophobic core region of the outer membrane (OM), the lipid-water interface regions of the OM, and for the helical membrane proteins (HMPs) residues at the lipid-water interface regions of the inner membrane (IM), respectively.

        "text": "Inhibition of mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening contributes to the neuroprotective effects of ischemic postconditioning in rats.\nIschemic postconditioning (IPost) has been shown to attenuate cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury. However, the mechanism remains elusive. Because opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) is a crucial determinant of cell death after ischemia-reperfusion, we hypothesized that the neuroprotective effect of IPost may be associated with inhibition of MPTP opening. In part 1 of this study, pentobarbital-anesthetized rats subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion for 90 min, followed by reperfusion for 72 h, were assigned to receive one of the following treatments: three cycles of IPost (15s each), intracerebroventricular injection of saline (control), administration of the MPTP inhibitor cyclosporin A (CsA) (2 mumol/L, 15 muL) or its vehicle alcohol, administration of the MPTP opener atractyloside (Atr) (2 mmol/L, 15 muL), or IPost plus CsA/Atr treatment. Neurological deficit scores (NDS) and infarct volumes were assessed. Mitochondrial ultrastructure and swelling were also examined after reperfusion. In part 2, control and IPost groups underwent ischemia (90 min) and reperfusion (15 min). CsA and Atr groups were treated as described in part 1. Brain mitochondria were isolated after reperfusion and MPTP activity was evaluated. IPost or CsA treatment significantly improved NDS and reduced infarction volume, while Atr reversed the neuroprotective effects of IPost, and attenuated the decrease in mitochondrial swelling induced by IPost or CsA. Thus, inhibiting MPTP opening may play a crucial role in the neuroprotective effects of IPost, which may have potential clinical value against cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury."

METHODS:  DESIGN: A retrospective, noncomparative, interventional case series. STUDY POPULATION: All patients who underwent optic nerve glioma resections using this technique with the authors between 1994 and 2010. PROCEDURE: A transcranial-orbital approach is used to resect the intracranial segment of the optic nerve glioma from 2 mm anterior to the chiasm to the posterior extent of annulus of Zinn. The proximal transected edge of the nerve is examined intraoperatively for tumor margin clearance. Through a superior orbitotomy exposure, the entire retrobulbar segment of the tumor is transected from the globe to the annulus of Zinn. A simulation of the procedure in a cadaver and en bloc resection of the orbital apex are performed to demonstrate the subdural plane of dissection within the annulus of Zinn. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Postoperative outcome measures include: health of the ipsilateral globe, paralytic ptosis, postoperative complications, and tumor recurrence. RESULTS: Eleven patients underwent resection of optic nerve gliomas using this technique. No patients had tumor recurrence or developed postoperative paralytic ptosis. CONCLUSIONS: The combined transcranial-orbital approach with preservation of the annulus of Zinn is a safe and effective way to remove optic nerve gliomas and ensure tumor clearance while avoiding paralytic ptosis."

Using inducible pre-B cell lines, we have now investigated the role of cell division during C/EBP-induced reprogramming. The majority of cells reprogrammed by C/EBPalpha incorporated BrdU before arresting at G(0), and all C/EBPbeta-induced cells incorporated the compound. This contrasts with reports from other systems where transdifferentiating cells essentially do not divide. Although inhibition of DNA synthesis led to an impairment of C/EBPalpha-induced transdifferentiation, sorted G(0)/G(1) and G(2)/M fractions showed no significant differences in their reprogramming kinetics. In addition, knocking-down p53 did not accelerate the transdifferentiation frequency, as it has been described for reprogramming of induced pluripotent (iPS) cells. Time-lapse experiments showed that, after C/EBPalpha induction, approximately 90% of cells divide once or twice, while 8% do not divide at all before acquiring a macrophage phenotype, supporting our BrdU incorporation results. Importantly, the non-dividing cell subset expressed the highest levels of C/EBPalpha and was the fastest in differentiating, suggesting that high levels of C/EBPalpha accelerate both the switching process and the cells' growth arrest. Our data show that traversing the cell cycle is not strictly required for pre-B cell to macrophage conversion and provides new evidence for the notion that the mechanisms of transcription factor induced transdifferentiation and iPS cell reprogramming differ."

Not much is known about the organization of splicing machinery and mechanisms in human malaria parasite. Present study reports the organization and assembly of Plasmodium spliceosome Sm core complex. METHODS: Presence of all the seven Plasmodium Sm-like proteins in the intra-erythrocytic stages was assessed based on the protein(s) expression analysis using immuno-localization and western blotting. Localization/co-localization studies were performed by immunofluorescence analysis on thin parasite smear using laser scanning confocal microscope. Interaction studies were carried out using yeast two-hybrid analysis and validated by in vitro pull-down assays. PfPRMT5 (arginine methyl transferase) and PfSmD1 interaction analysis was performed by pull-down assays and the interacting proteins were identified by MALDI-TOF spectrometry. RESULTS: PfSm proteins are expressed at asexual blood stages of the parasite and show nucleo-cytoplasmic localization. Protein-protein interaction studies showed that PfSm proteins form a heptameric complex, typical of spliceosome core complex as shown in humans. Interaction of PfSMN (survival of motor neuron, tudor domain containing protein) or PfTu-TSN (Tudor domain of Tudor Staphylococcal nuclease) with PfSmD1 proteins was found to be methylation dependent. Co-localization by immunofluorescence and co-immunoprecipitation studies suggested an association between PfPRMT5 and PfSmD1, indicating the role of arginine methylation in assembly of Plasmodium spliceosome complex. CONCLUSIONS: Plasmodium Sm-like proteins form a heptameric ring-like structure, although the arrangement of PfSm proteins slightly differs from human splicing machinery. The data shows the interaction of PfSMN with PfSmD1 and this interaction is found to be methylation dependent. PfPRMT5 probably exists as a part of methylosome complex that may function in the cytoplasmic assembly of Sm proteins at asexual blood stages of P. falciparum."

Inactive mutation of either TSC1 or TSC2 unleashes mTOR signaling and consequently causes TSC, a benign tumor syndrome affecting multiple organs. We report here that expression of alphaB-crystallin was upregulated in Tsc1-/- or Tsc2-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts, Eker rat uterine leiomyoma-derived Tsc2-deficient ELT3 cells, mutant Tsc2-associated mouse kidney tumors, and human lung lymphangioleiomyomatosis nodules. alphaB-crystallin was transcriptionally activated by mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2): nuclear factor-kappa B (NFkappaB) signaling cascade. The augmented alphaB-crystallin was critical for the migration, invasion and apoptotic resistance of Tsc2-defective cells. Disruption of alphaB-crystallin suppressed Tsc2-null cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. Therefore, enhanced alphaB-crystallin has an essential role in TSC1/2 complex deficiency-mediated tumorigenesis, and inhibition of alphaB-crystallin may complement the current therapy for TSC. "

Glomerulopathy occurred in both species with species-specific characteristics. Glomerular lesions in mice were characterized by progressive hyaline matrix accumulation, accompanied by the presence of renal amyloid and with subsequent papillary necrosis. Early changes involved glomerular endothelial hypertrophy and degeneration, but the chronic glomerular amyloid and hyaline alterations in mice appeared to be species specific. An immune-mediated mechanism for the glomerular lesions in mice was supported by early inflammatory changes including increased expression of inflammatory cytokines and other immunomodulatory genes within the renal cortex, increased stimulation of CD68 protein, and systemic elevation of monocyte chemotactic protein 1. In contrast, kidneys from monkeys given drisapersen chronically showed less severe glomerular changes characterized by increased mesangial and inflammatory cells, endothelial cell hypertrophy, and subepithelial and membranous electron-dense deposits, with ultrastructural and immunohistochemical characteristics of complement and complement-related fragments. Lesions in monkeys resembled typical features of C3 glomerulopathy, a condition described in man and experimental animals to be linked to dysregulation of the alternative complement pathway. Thus, inflammatory/immune mechanisms appear critical to glomerular injury with species-specific sensitivities for mouse and monkey. The lower observed proinflammatory activity in humans as compared to mice and monkeys may reflect a lower risk of glomerular injury in patients receiving AON therapy. "

In this work we identify a physical and functional poly(ADP-ribose)-mediated interaction of PARP1 with the E3 ubiquitin ligase UHRF1 (also known as NP95, ICBP90) that influences two UHRF1-regulated cellular processes. On the one hand, we uncovered a cooperative interplay between PARP1 and UHRF1 in the accumulation of the heterochromatin repressive mark H4K20me3. The absence of PARP1 led to reduced accumulation of H4K20me3 onto pericentric heterochromatin that coincided with abnormally enhanced transcription. The loss of H4K20me3 was rescued by the additional depletion of UHRF1. In contrast, although PARP1 also seemed to facilitate the association of UHRF1 with DNMT1, its absence did not impair the loading of DNMT1 onto heterochromatin or the methylation of pericentric regions, possibly owing to a compensating interaction of DNMT1 with PCNA. On the other hand, we showed that PARP1 controls the UHRF1-mediated ubiquitination of DNMT1 to timely regulate its abundance during S and G2 phase. Together, this report identifies PARP1 as a novel modulator of two UHRF1-regulated heterochromatin-associated events: the accumulation of H4K20me3 and the clearance of DNMT1. "

However, the protein products of these genes involved in forming CCM signaling, are still poorly understood imposing an urgent need to understand these genes and their signaling processes in details. So far involvement of CCM3/PDCD10 in the cavernous angioma has been characterized from biochemical and biophysical analyses. However, there is no comprehensive study illustrating the phylogenetic history and comprehensive genetic variants of CCM3/PDCD10. Herein, we explored the phylogenetic history and genetic variants of CCM3/PDCD10 gene. Synteny analyses revealed that CCM3/PDCD10 gene shared same genomic loci from Drosophila to human and the gene structure of CCM3/PDCD10 is conserved from human to Branchiostoma floridae for about 500 MYs with some changes in sea urchin and in insects. The conserved CCM3/PDCD10 is characterized by presence of indels in the N-terminal dimerization domain. We identified 951 CCM3/PDCD10 variants by analysis of 1092 human genomes with top three variation classes belongs to 84% SNPs, 6.9% insertions and 6.2% deletions. We identified 22 missense mutations in the human CCM3/PDCD10 protein and out of which three mutations are deleterious. We also identified four stop-codon gaining mutations at the positions E34*, E68*, E97* and E140*, respectively. This study is the first comprehensive analysis of the CCM3/PDCD10 gene based on phylogenetic origin and genetic variants.

To gain insights into isolated/nonsyndromic USH2A retinopathy, we screened USH2A in 186 probands with recessive retinal disease and no hearing complaint in childhood (discovery cohort) and in 84 probands with recessive retinal disease (replication cohort). Detailed phenotyping, including retinal imaging and audiological assessment, was performed in individuals with two likely disease-causing USH2A variants. Further genetic testing, including screening for a deep-intronic disease-causing variant and large deletions/duplications, was performed in those with one likely disease-causing change. Overall, 23 of 186 probands (discovery cohort) were found to harbour two likely disease-causing variants in USH2A. Some of these variants were predominantly associated with nonsyndromic retinal degeneration ('retinal disease-specific'); these included the common c.2276 G>T, p.(Cys759Phe) mutation and five additional variants: c.2802 T>G, p.(Cys934Trp); c.10073 G>A, p.(Cys3358Tyr); c.11156 G>A, p.(Arg3719His); c.12295-3 T>A; and c.12575 G>A, p.(Arg4192His). An allelic hierarchy was observed in the discovery cohort and confirmed in the replication cohort. In nonsyndromic USH2A disease, retinopathy was consistent with retinitis pigmentosa and the audiological phenotype was variable. USH2A retinopathy is a common cause of nonsyndromic recessive retinal degeneration and has a different mutational spectrum to that observed in Usher syndrome. The following model is proposed: the presence of at least one 'retinal disease-specific' USH2A allele in a patient with USH2A-related disease results in the preservation of normal hearing. Careful genotype-phenotype studies such as this will become increasingly important, especially now that high-throughput sequencing is widely used in the clinical setting. "

The role of B cells in modulating the immune response to solid tumors as well as lymphoid malignancies is less well understood. Murine models of autoimmune disease have defined B regulatory cell (Breg) subsets with immune suppressive activity, including B cell subsets that express IL-10, and transforming growth factor-beta, which can facilitate T regulatory cell recruitment and expansion. Multiple murine tumor models point to the existence of similar immune suppressive B cell sub-populations that can migrate into tumor deposits and acquire an immune suppressive phenotype, which then leads to attenuation of the local anti-tumor immune response. Other murine models of viral or chemically induced skin carcinogenesis have identified a pivotal role for B cells in promoting inflammation and carcinogenesis. While many human solid tumors demonstrate significant B cell infiltration and/or tertiary lymphoid structure formation, the functional properties of tumor-infiltrating B cells and their effects on immunity are poorly understood. Recent successes in early Phase I/II trials using anti-checkpoint inhibitor antibodies such as nivolumab or pidilizumab directed against PD-1 in the setting of Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas validate the therapeutic utility of reversing B cell-mediated immune suppression.

We describe the clinical, functional, and molecular findings from a large series of late-onset Friedreich's ataxia and very-late-onset Friedreich's ataxia and compare them with typical-onset Friedreich's ataxia. METHODS: Phenotypic and genotypic comparison of 44 late-onset Friedreich's ataxia, 30 very late-onset Friedreich's ataxia, and 180 typical Friedreich's ataxia was undertaken. RESULTS: Delayed-onset Friedreich's ataxia (late-onset Friedreich's ataxia and very-late-onset Friedreich's ataxia) had less frequently dysarthria, abolished tendon reflexes, extensor plantar reflexes, weakness, amyotrophy, ganglionopathy, cerebellar atrophy, scoliosis, and cardiomyopathy than typical-onset Friedreich's ataxia, along with less severe functional disability and shorter GAA expansion on the smaller allele (P < 0.001). Delayed-onset Friedreich's ataxia had lower scale for the assessment and rating of ataxia and spinocerebellar degeneration functional scores and longer disease duration before wheelchair confinement (P < 0.001). Both GAA expansions were negatively correlated to age at disease onset (P < 0.001), but the smaller GAA expansion accounted for 62.9% of age at onset variation and the larger GAA expansion for 15.6%.

Thus, vascular tumors are highly permeable and grow vigorously; this occurrence results in rapid growth and metastasis cancer cells. Therefore, understanding the characteristics of endothelial cells in the tumor microenvironment guides anti-angiogenic therapy. To this end, we explore the effect of the supernatant obtained from cultured Anip973 cells (high-metastatic human lung adenocarcinoma cells) on the biological behavior and on the cell surface markers of the human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC). METHODS: The HUVEC that was cultured in a medium (RPMI-1640 + 10% fetal bovine serum) containing various concentrations of Anip973 supernatants was categorized into experimental groups. The HUVEC cultured in a medium without Anip973 supernatants served as the control group. Proliferation was determined with CCK-8; blood vessel formation was investigated with three-dimensional culture techniques in vitro; and HUVEC migration was observed via transwell assay. At the same time, the expressions of CD105, CD31, and the apoptotic marker of Annexin V were detected through flow cytometry for analyzing the relationship between the expression of cell surface markers and biological behavior. RESULTS: Following incubation with the supernatant obtained from cultured Anip973 cells, HUVEC proliferated more than the control group did, and the proliferation rate was maximized when incubated in a supernatant concentration of 250 muL/mL for 24 h (P=0.002). In addition, the experimental groups exhibited varying degrees of migration and forms of vascular lumen sample structure, especially at supernatant concentrations of 125 microL/mL (P<0.001) and 250 microL/mL (P=0.002), respectively. CD105 expression was optimized at 250 muL/mL (P=0.028), and CD31 expression also increased with an increase in concentration. However, the percentage of apoptotic cells decreased. Correlation analysis results showed that cell proliferation, migration, and CD105 expression were significantly and positively correlated with one another. By contrast, no significant correlation was detected between CD31 expression and biological behavior. CONCLUSIONS: Anip973 supernatants can promote HUVEC proliferation and migration, as well as angiogenesis. In addition, cell surface markers can change concurrently and relatively. To a certain extent, changes in CD105 expression can be attributed to shifts in its biological behavior. : ."

Bioactive microbial metabolites provide a successful source of novel compounds with pharmaceutical potentials. The bacterium Pseudomonas sp. In5 is a biocontrol strain isolated from a plant disease suppressive soil in Greenland, which produces two antimicrobial nonribosomal peptides (NRPs), nunapeptin and nunamycin. Methods. In this study, we used in vitro antimicrobial and anticancer bioassays to evaluate the potential bioactivities of both a crude extract derived from Pseudomonas sp. In5 and NRPs purified from the crude extract. Results. We verified that the crude extract derived from Pseudomonas sp. In5 showed suppressive activity against the basidiomycete Rhizoctonia solani by inducing a mitochondrial stress-response. Furthermore, we confirmed suppressive activity against the oomycete Pythium aphanidermatum by the Pseudomonas sp. In5 crude extract, and that the purified nunamycin and nunapeptin displayed distinct antimicrobial activities. In addition to the antimicrobial activity, we found that treatment of the cancer cell lines, Jurkat T-cells, Granta cells, and melanoma cells, with the Pseudomonas sp. In5 crude extract increased staining with the apoptotic marker Annexin V while no staining of healthy normal cells, i.e., naive or activated CD4 T-cells, was observed. Treatment with either of the NRPs alone did not increase Annexin V staining of the Jurkat T-cells, despite individually showing robust antimicrobial activity, whereas an anticancer activity was detected when nunamycin and nunapeptin were used in combination. Discussion. Our results suggest that the bioactivity of a crude extract derived from Pseudomonas sp. In5 involves the presence of both nunamycin and nunapeptin and highlight the possibility of synergy between multiple microbial metabolites. "

Importantly, another group of patients with tumours bearing a similar repair deficiency but without BRCA mutations may also be susceptible to PARP inhibition and efforts to develop an HRD assay are therefore a priority so that these patients can be identified as PARPi candidates. In addition, combination strategies are an area of intense research; these include combinations with antiangiogenic agents and with inhibitors of the P13K/AKT pathway and others are likely to merit assessment since resistance to PARP inhibitors will certainly emerge as the next challenge. While olaparib is the first PARP inhibitor to receive approval for ovarian cancer treatment, others including rucaparib and niraparib are clearly effective in this disease and, within the next year or two, the results of ongoing randomised trials will clarify their respective roles. PARP inhibitors are generally well tolerated; regulatory approval at present supports their use as a maintenance therapy (in Europe) and as treatment for advanced recurrent disease (in the United States), but it is likely that these indications will extend as the results of ongoing trials become available. Ten years have elapsed between the first pre-clinical publications and the regulatory approval of PARP inhibitors and the next 10 years promise to be even more productive."

While efficiently silenced by the epigenetic machinery, they can be reactivated upon stress or during development. Their level of transcription not reflecting their transposition ability, it is thus difficult to evaluate their contribution to the active mobilome. Here we applied a simple methodology based on the high throughput sequencing of extrachromosomal circular DNA (eccDNA) forms of active retrotransposons to characterize the repertoire of mobile retrotransposons in plants. This method successfully identified known active retrotransposons in both Arabidopsis and rice material where the epigenome is destabilized. When applying mobilome-seq to developmental stages in wild type rice, we identified PopRice as a highly active retrotransposon producing eccDNA forms in the wild type endosperm. The mobilome-seq strategy opens new routes for the characterization of a yet unexplored fraction of plant genomes."

Disease registries have been helpful in this regard. Lipoprotein Lipase Deficiency (LPLD) is a rare, autosomal-recessive lipid disorder characterized by severe hypertriglyceridemia and a very high risk for recurrent acute pancreatitis, however, only limited data are available on its natural course. Alipogene tiparvovec (Glybera ) is the first gene therapy to receive Marketing Authorization in the European Union; GENIALL (GENetherapy In the MAnagement of Lipoprotein Lipase Deficiency), a 15-year registry focusing on LPLD was launched in 2014 as part of its Risk Management Plan. The aim of this publication is to introduce the GENIALL Registry within a structured literature review of registries in rare genetic lipid disorders. A total of 11 relevant initiatives/registries were identified (homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (hoFH) [n = 5]; LPLD [n = 1]; Lysosomal Acid Lipase Deficiency [LALD, n = 1], detection of mutations in genetic lipid disorders [n = 4]). Besides one product registry in hoFH and the LALD registry, all other initiatives are local or country-specific. GENIALL is the first global prospective registry in LPLD that will collect physician and patient generated data on the natural course of LPLD, as well as long-term outcomes of gene therapy. CONCLUSION: There is a limited number of international initiatives focusing on the natural course of specific rare genetic lipid disorders. The GENIALL LPLD Registry could be the first step towards a future broader global initiative that collects data related to familial chylomicronemia syndrome and their underlying genetic causes."

However, none of the IFT-B core complex proteins have been associated with nonsyndromic retinal dystrophies. Given the importance of ciliary transport in photoreceptor function and structural maintenance, we sought to investigate the impact of IFT (intraflagellar transport) mutations in nonsyndromic retinopathies. Methods: Whole exome sequencing was performed on 50 cone-rod dystrophy (CRD) patients that were previously screened for mutations in known retinal disease genes. The impact of candidate mutation was studied using in vitro cell system and in vivo zebrafish assay to determine the pathogenicity of the variant. Results: Compound heterozygous mutations in IFT81, including one nonsense (c.1213C>T, p.R405*) and one missense variant (c.1841T>C, p.L614P), were identified in a nonsyndromic CRD proband. Extensive functional analyses of the missense variant in cell culture and zebrafish strongly suggests its pathogenic nature. Loss of IFT81 impairs ciliogenesis and, interestingly, the missense variant displayed significantly reduced rescue of ciliogenesis in the IFT81 knockdown in vitro system. Consistently, dramatic reduction of rescue efficiency of the ift81 mutant zebrafish embryo by mRNA with the missense variant was observed, further supporting its pathogenicity. Conclusions: Consistent with the function of the IFT-B complex in the maintenance of photoreceptor cilium, we report a case of mutations in a core IFT-B protein, IFT81. This represents the first report of mutations in IFT81 as a candidate gene for nonsyndromic retinal dystrophy, hence expanding the phenotype spectrum of IFT-B components."

This study compared the effects of supplementation with vitamin C, vitamin E, or ALA on the antioxidant defense system and the expression of immune-related genes under oxidative stress induced by dexamethasone (DEX) in broilers. In total, 240 one-day-old female Recessive White Rock chickens were assigned randomly to either a basal diet (control group) or basal diet supplemented with vitamin C (200 mg/kg diet), vitamin E (100 mg/kg), or ALA (500 mg/kg) for 28 d starting from hatching. At 21 d of age, birds fed the ALA-supplemented diet had the highest plasma total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) and superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) enzyme activities, and the lowest plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) activity, as well as the lowest mRNA gene expression levels of interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) and lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor-alpha factor (LITAF). At 23 d of age, the broilers in the 3 treatment groups were injected in the thigh muscle with DEX for 3 alternating days. In addition, the control group was divided into 2 equal groups, in which one was injected with saline and the other was injected with DEX. At 28 d of age, the DEX-ALA group (P < 0.05) had the highest activity levels for T-AOC, T-SOD, and GSH-PX in the plasma and liver (P < 0.05), and the greatest reduction in the MDA level. Dietary ALA significantly decreased the mRNA expression levels of the interleukin 1 beta (IL-1beta), IL-6, IFN-gamma, and LITAF genes compared with the other groups during oxidative stress by DEX. In conclusion, this study suggests that in broilers, ALA is more effective for normalizing the oxidative stress induced by DEX than vitamin C or vitamin E."

Survival from time of relapse is typically measured in weeks to months, and standard chemotherapy and currently approved targeted therapy achieve remission in less than a third of affected patients. To date, the only definitive curative therapy has been allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Advances in immunotherapy, with the introduction of chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapies and the development of tisagenlecleucel, have changed the landscape. Areas covered: This review will describe the pharmacology of tisagenlecleucel and summarize the clinical evidence for its use in the treatment of multiple-relapsed or refractory B-cell ALL (B-ALL). Also discussed are other immunotherapies for B-ALL as well as the most commonly-encountered toxicities and corresponding management strategies. Expert commentary: Early phase trials indicate that tisagenlecleucel significantly improves survival for patients with B-ALL that is refractory or in second or later relapse. In responding patients, remissions have been reported on the order of years, and thus, tisagenlecleucel may herald a dramatic shift in the treatment paradigm of this largely fatal disease."

A phase 1, non-randomised, open-label, multiple-dose study was done to assess the safety, tolerability, and activity of trastuzumab deruxtecan in HER2-expressing, advanced solid tumours. The dose escalation (part 1) has previously been reported and the recommended doses for expansion of 5 4 mg/kg or 6 4 mg/kg were established. In this Article, we report the safety and preliminary activity results from this phase 1 trial in all patients with HER2-positive advanced-stage breast cancer with previous trastuzumab emtansine treatment who received trastuzumab deruxtecan at the recommended doses for expansion. METHODS: We did an open-label, dose-escalation and dose-expansion phase 1 trial at eight hospitals and clinics in the USA and six in Japan. Eligible patients were at least 18 years old in the USA and at least 20 years of age in Japan and had advanced solid tumours (regardless of HER2 expression in dose escalation or HER2 expression or mutation in dose expansion). The recommended doses for expansion of 5 4 mg/kg or 6 4 mg/kg trastuzumab deruxtecan were administered intravenously to patients once every 3 weeks until withdrawal of consent, unacceptable toxicity, or progressive disease. In this Article, all patients with HER2-positive advanced-stage breast cancer with previous trastuzumab emtansine treatment who received trastuzumab deruxtecan at the recommended doses for expansion were analysed together. The primary endpoints of the study were safety and preliminary activity (proportion of patients who achieved an objective response as assessed by the investigators). The activity evaluable set included all patients who received at least one dose of trastuzumab deruxtecan at the recommended doses for expansion, and for whom both baseline and post-treatment activity data were available. The safety analysis set included all patients who received at least one dose of trastuzumab deruxtecan at the recommended doses for expansion. Enrolment for patients with HER2-positive breast cancer has been completed. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02564900, and ClinicalTrials.jp, number JapicCTI-152978. FINDINGS: Between Aug 28, 2015, and Aug 10, 2018, 115 of 118 patients with HER2-positive breast cancer were treated with at least one dose of trastuzumab deruxtecan at the recommended doses for expansion. All patients had at least one treatment-emergent adverse event. Frequent grade 3 or worse treatment-emergent adverse events included anaemia (19 [17%] of 115) and decreased neutrophil (16 [14%]), white blood cell (ten [9%]), and platelet (nine [8%]) counts. At least one serious treatment-emergent adverse event occurred for 22 (19%) patients. Investigators reported 20 cases of interstitial lung disease, pneumonitis, or organising pneumonia, including one grade 3 event and two treatment-related deaths due to pneumonitis. One death unrelated to study treatment was due to progressive disease. 66 (59 5%; 95% CI 49 7-68 7) of 111 patients had a confirmed objective response. INTERPRETATION: Trastuzumab deruxtecan had a manageable safety profile and showed preliminary activity in trastuzumab emtansine-pretreated patients with HER2-positive breast cancer. These results suggest that further development in phase 2 and 3 clinical trials for HER2-positive breast cancer is warranted. FUNDING: Daiichi Sankyo Co, Ltd."

Although the exact function of PGRN is unknown, it has been increasingly implicated in lysosomal physiology. Here we report that PGRN interacts with the lysosomal enzyme, glucocerebrosidase (GCase), and is essential for proper GCase activity. GCase activity is significantly reduced in tissue lysates from PGRN-deficient mice. This is further evidence that reduced lysosomal hydrolase activity may be a pathological mechanism in cases of GRN-related FTLD and NCL."

Epigenetic modifications include changes such as DNA methylation, histone modifications and RNA associated gene silencing. Transcriptional regulation, chromosome stability, DNA replication and DNA repair are all controlled by these modifications. Mutations in genes encoding epigenetic modifiers are a frequent occurrence in hematologic malignancies and important in both the initiation and progression of cancer. Epigenetic modifications are also frequently reversible, allowing excellent opportunities for therapeutic intervention. The goal of epigenetic therapies is to reverse epigenetic dysregulation, restore the epigenetic balance, and revert malignant cells to a more normal condition. The role of epigenetic therapies thus far is most established in hematologic malignancies, with several agents already approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. In this review, we discuss pharmacological agents targeting epigenetic regulators."

Specific histone modifications, such as monomethylation on histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me1) and H3K27ac, have been widely used to assign enhancer regions in mammalian genomes. In recent years, emerging evidence suggests that active enhancers are bidirectionally transcribed to produce enhancer RNAs (eRNAs). This finding not only adds a new reliable feature to define enhancers but also raises a fundamental question of how eRNAs function to activate transcription. Although some believe that eRNAs are merely transcriptional byproducts, many studies have demonstrated that eRNAs execute crucial tasks in regulating chromatin conformation and transcription activation. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of eRNAs from their biogenesis, functions, and regulation to their pathological significance. Additionally, we discuss the challenges and possible mechanisms of eRNAs in regulated transcription."

One-third of patients hospitalized due to severe COVID-19 develops macrovascular thrombotic complications, including venous thromboembolism, myocardial injury/infarction and stroke. Concurrently, the autopsy series indicate multiorgan damage pattern consistent with microvascular injury. PROPHYLAXIS, DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT: COVID-19 associated coagulopathy has distinct features, including markedly elevated D-dimers concentration with nearly normal activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time and platelet count. The diagnosis may be challenging due to overlapping features between pulmonary embolism and severe COVID-19 disease, such as dyspnoea, high concentration of D-dimers, right ventricle with dysfunction or enlargement, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Both macro- and microvascular complications are associated with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality. Therefore, early recognition of coagulation abnormalities among hospitalized COVID-19 patients are critical measures to identify patients with poor prognosis, guide antithrombotic prophylaxis or treatment, and improve patients' clinical outcomes. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CLINICIANS: Most of the guidelines and consensus documents published on behalf of professional societies focused on thrombosis and hemostasis advocate the use of anticoagulants in all patients hospitalized with COVID-19, as well as 2-6 weeks post hospital discharge in the absence of contraindications. However, since there is no guidance for deciding the intensity and duration of anticoagulation, the decision-making process should be made in individual-case basis. CONCLUSIONS: Here, we review the mechanistic relationships between inflammation and thrombosis, discuss the macrovascular and microvascular complications and summarize the prophylaxis, diagnosis and treatment of thromboembolism in patients affected by COVID-19."

METHODS: We performed a multistage exome sequencing and genetic association analysis to identify genes in which rare protein-coding variants were associated with liver phenotypes. We conducted in vitro experiments to further characterize associations. RESULTS: The multistage analysis involved 542,904 persons with available data on liver aminotransferase levels, 24,944 patients with various types of liver disease, and 490,636 controls without liver disease. We found that rare coding variants in APOB, ABCB4, SLC30A10, and TM6SF2 were associated with increased aminotransferase levels and an increased risk of liver disease. We also found that variants in CIDEB, which encodes a structural protein found in hepatic lipid droplets, had a protective effect. The burden of rare predicted loss-of-function variants plus missense variants in CIDEB (combined carrier frequency, 0.7%) was associated with decreased alanine aminotransferase levels (beta per allele, -1.24 U per liter; 95% confidence interval [CI], -1.66 to -0.83; P = 4.8x10-9) and with 33% lower odds of liver disease of any cause (odds ratio per allele, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.57 to 0.79; P = 9.9x10-7). Rare coding variants in CIDEB were associated with a decreased risk of liver disease across different underlying causes and different degrees of severity, including cirrhosis of any cause (odds ratio per allele, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.70). Among 3599 patients who had undergone bariatric surgery, rare coding variants in CIDEB were associated with a decreased nonalcoholic fatty liver disease activity score (beta per allele in score units, -0.98; 95% CI, -1.54 to -0.41 [scores range from 0 to 8, with higher scores indicating more severe disease]). In human hepatoma cell lines challenged with oleate, CIDEB small interfering RNA knockdown prevented the buildup of large lipid droplets.

However, early adaptive resistance occurs due to rewiring of signaling pathways, activating receptor tyrosine kinases, primarily EGFR, but also MET and ligands. Evidence indicates that treatment with KRAS G12C inhibitors (sotorasib) triggers the MRAS:SHOC2:PP1C trimeric complex. Activation of MRAS occurs from alterations in the Scribble and Hippo-dependent pathways, leading to YAP activation. Other mechanisms that involve STAT3 signaling are intertwined with the activation of MRAS. The high-resolution MRAS:SHOC2:PP1C crystallization structure allows in silico analysis for drug development. Activation of MRAS:SHOC2:PP1C is primarily Scribble-driven and downregulated by HUWE1. The reactivation of the MRAS complex is carried out by valosin containing protein (VCP). Exploring these pathways as therapeutic targets and their impact on different chemotherapeutic agents (carboplatin, paclitaxel) is crucial.

The elevation of the intracranial pressure is isolated; therefore, diseases such as cerebral venous thrombosis or dural fistulas should not be considered as etiologies of BIH. The exact definition of BIH remains debated, and other terms such as \"pseudotumor cerebri\" or \"idiopathic intracranial hypertension\" are often used in the literature. Although we agree that BIH is usually not a so benign disease, we suggest that BIH is still the most appropriate term to describe this entity which should be classified as \"secondary BIH\" or \"idiopathic BIH\" depending on whether there are precipitating factors for the development of BIH or not. We also propose new diagnostic criteria emphasizing the need for investigations for the diagnostic of secondary and idiopathic BIH. The management of patients with BIH depends mainly on the presence and severity of ocular symptoms and signs on which the prognostic of the disease is based. Repeated lumbar punctures associated with acetazolamide and weight loss are usually efficient enough. However a surgical treatment (optic nerve sheath fenestration or lumboperitoneal shunt) is required when appropriate medical management does not prevent progressive alteration of vision (visual loss or visual field defect), or when the patients complains of severe, refractory headaches. Careful follow-up with repeated formal visual field testing may help preventing a devastating visual loss in these patients."

Reuptake of 5-HT and (less potently) NE into cerebral synaptosomes was inhibited by S33005, whereas DA reuptake was little affected. In vivo, S33005 prevented depletion of cerebral pools of 5-HT by parachloroamphetamine. Furthermore, it decreased electrical activity of raphe-localized serotonergic neurones, an action abolished by the 5-HT1A antagonist WAY100,635. At higher doses, S33005 blocked firing of locus ceruleus-localized adrenergic neurones, an action abolished by the alpha2-adrenergic antagonist idazoxan. In contrast, S33005 did not inhibit ventrotegmental dopaminergic neurones. In frontal cortex of freely moving rats, S33005 dose dependently elevated dialysate levels of 5-HT, NE, and DA. In hippocampus, levels of 5-HT and NE were similarly elevated, while in nucleus accumbens and striatum, levels of 5-HT were increased whereas DA was unaffected. Upon chronic (2 weeks) administration, basal levels of NE were elevated in frontal cortex and, therein, 5-HT2A receptor density was decreased. Comparative studies with clinically used antidepressants showed that venlafaxine possessed a profile similar to S33005 but was less potent. Clomipramine likewise interacted with SERTs and NETs but also with several other receptors types, while citalopram and reboxetine were preferential ligands of SERTs and NETs, respectively. In conclusion, S33005 interacts potently with SERTs and, less markedly, with NETs. It enhances extracellular levels of 5-HT and NE throughout corticolimbic structures and selectively elevates dialysis levels of DA in frontal cortex versus subcortical regions."

Probing further into the molecular signals leading to apoptosis of EAC cells, we observed that curcumin is causing tumor cell death by the up-regulation of the proto-oncoprotein Bax, release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria, and activation of caspase-3. The status of Bcl-2 remains unchanged in EAC, which would signify that curcumin is bypassing the Bcl-2 checkpoint and overriding its protective effect on apoptosis."

Thalidomide is attracting growing interest because of its reported immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties. Current evidence indicates that thalidomide reduces the activity of the inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha by accelerating the degradation of its messenger RNA. Thalidomide inhibits angiogenesis. Recently, thalidomide was approved for sale in the United States for the treatment of erythema nodosum leprosum, an inflammatory complication of Hansen's disease. Thalidomide has been used successfully in several other dermatologic disorders, including aphthous stomatitis, Behcet's syndrome, chronic cutaneous systemic lupus erythematosus, and graft-versus-host disease, the apparent shared characteristic of which is immune dysregulation. Many recent studies have evaluated thalidomide in patients with HIV infection, in which this drug is an efficacious agent against oral aphthous ulcers, HIV-associated wasting syndrome, HIV-related diarrhea, and Kaposi's sarcoma. Only in the last several years has thalidomide been aggressively investigated for its antiangiogenic potential and immunomodulatory properties in various tumor types. Current research on thalidomide in oncology covers investigation in a wide range of both solid tumors and hematologic malignancies."

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors improve exercise capacity in adults with congestive heart failure by improving diastolic function and decreasing SVR. We tested the hypothesis that ACE inhibitors decrease SVR and improve exercise capacity in patients after intraatrial baffle procedure for TGA. We studied the effects of enalapril in nine patients with TGA s/p intraatrial switch (mean age, 13.8 +/- 3 years) 7 to 21 years (mean, 12 +/- 4 years) after intraatrial baffle procedure. Enalapril (0.5 mg/kg/day, maximum dosage 20 mg bid) was administered for 12 months. Patients exercised using a cycle ergometer ramp protocol (0.25 W/kg/min) before enalapril (baseline), 1 month, 6 months, and 12 months after treatment initiation. Heart rate, blood pressure, cardiac output, respiratory rate, minute ventilation, oxygen consumption (VO2), total exercise time, work, and power were measured. SVR, cardiac index, and stroke volume index (SVI) were calculated. Two-tailed paired Student's t-test was used to compare data to those of normal control patients and the patients' baseline data. Patients had lower resting heart rate, cardiac index, maximum heart rate, cardiac index (CI), SVI, VO2, exercise time, work, and power and higher maximal SVR at baseline compared to normal control patients. There was no significant difference in total exercise time, work, power, VO2 (rest/peak), SVR, SVI, and CI after 12 months of therapy compared to patients' baseline values. We conclude that short-term (<1 year) use of enalapril does not improve exercise performance in patients with TGA in whom the intraatrial baffle procedure has been performed."

A prospective study of 1.4 million Swedish births.\nOBJECTIVE: Studies of the effect of maternal smoking during pregnancy on development of brain tumors in the offspring generally have found no increase in risk but most have mainly relied on retrospective exposure assessment. We conducted a prospective study on a large birth cohort in Sweden. METHODS: Women giving birth during 1983-1997 were classified as smokers or non-smokers based on information ascertained at the first prenatal visit and recorded in the Swedish Birth Register. Follow-up of brain tumor incidence among offspring through 1997 was achieved by linkage with the Swedish Cancer Register. Hazard ratios were estimated using Cox proportional hazard regression, adjusting for demographic characteristics available in the Birth Register. RESULTS: Brain tumors (n=480) occurred at a rate of 4.5 cases per 100,000 person-years. Children of women who smoked during pregnancy had an increased incidence of brain tumors (hazard ratio = 1.24; 95% confidence interval: 1.01-1.53). The increase in risk was similar for benign and malignant tumors, and was most apparent for astrocytoma. The effect of smoking on the occurrence of brain tumors was seen most strongly among 2-4 year-old children. CONCLUSIONS: These results support a role for maternal smoking during pregnancy in the etiology of childhood brain tumors. Our findings should be confirmed in other prospective studies."

SERCA is a membrane protein that belongs to the family of P-type ion translocating ATPases and pumps free cytosolic calcium into intracellular stores. Active transport of Ca2+ is achieved, according to the E1-E2 model, changing of SERCA structure by Ca2+. The affinity of Ca2+ -binding sites varies from high (E1) to low (E2). Three different SERCA genes were identified-SERCA1, SERCA2, and SERCA3. SERCA is mainly represented by the SERCA2a isoform in the heart. In heart muscle, during systole, depolarization triggers the release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and starts contraction. During diastole, muscle relaxation occurs as Ca2+ is again removed from cytosol, predominantly by accumulation into SR via the action of SERCA2a. The main regulator of SERCA2a is phospholamban and another regulator proteolipid of SERCA is sarcolipin. There are a lot of studies on the effect of decreased and/or increased SERCA activity in genesis of arrhythmia. Actually both decrease and increase of SERCA activity in the heart result in some pathological mechanisms such as heart failure and arrhythmia."

This study examines the potential advantage of employing high-sensitivity (hs)-IL-6 as a possible biomarker at the early stages of acute stroke for identifying an acute phase response and its potential rheological and clinical implications. METHODS: Venous blood was obtained from 186 stroke patients within 24 h of hospital admission and 3-5 days thereafter in order to characterize an inflammatory and hemorheological profile (including erythrocyte aggregation). Neurological state was assessed by the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and the modified Rankin scale (mRs). RESULTS: While most biomarkers displayed elevated concentrations with time, serum concentrations of hs-IL-6 declined 3-5 days following acute stroke. Initially elevated levels of hs-IL-6 at presentation further correlated with unfavorable clinical outcomes (by NIHSS and mRs) at both time points. Analysis of variance in the different quartiles identified an hs-IL-6 gradient-dependent correlation at both time points, such that the higher the initial hs-IL-6 concentration, the higher the elevation in inflammatory biomarkers and the poorer the neurological state at both time points (p<0.001 for NIHSS and p=0.001 for mRs, for trend across quartiles). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the potential of employing hs-IL-6 as an early stage biomarker for the prognosis of acute ischemic stroke. Such an advance would provide the means to identify at an early stage the patients who would require closer clinical surveillance and/or administration of therapeutic interventions."

Increasing knowledge about genes implicated in pharmacokinetics, mode of action, efficacy, and toxicity of drugs has already provided relevant results for clinical practice, for example: The strong association of the abacavir hypersensitivity reaction with HLA-B*5701 permits testing patients for the allele, and if present avoiding the drug and therefore preventing the reaction. Persons with the allele CYP2B6*6 present higher efavirenz \"area under the curve\" and have increased risk of neuropsychological toxicity. Additional gene variants are being discovered that influence the action of antiretroviral drugs.

Until very recently, all metazoan genomes investigated encoded selenoproteins, and these proteins had therefore been believed to be essential for animal life. Challenging this assumption, recent comparative analyses of insect genomes have revealed that some insect genomes appear to have lost selenoprotein genes. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this paper we investigate in detail the fate of selenoproteins, and that of selenoprotein factors, in all available arthropod genomes. We use a variety of in silico comparative genomics approaches to look for known selenoprotein genes and factors involved in selenoprotein biosynthesis. We have found that five insect species have completely lost the ability to encode selenoproteins and that selenoprotein loss in these species, although so far confined to the Endopterygota infraclass, cannot be attributed to a single evolutionary event, but rather to multiple, independent events. Loss of selenoproteins and selenoprotein factors is usually coupled to the deletion of the entire no-longer functional genomic region, rather than to sequence degradation and consequent pseudogenisation. Such dynamics of gene extinction are consistent with the high rate of genome rearrangements observed in Drosophila. We have also found that, while many selenoprotein factors are concomitantly lost with the selenoproteins, others are present and conserved in all investigated genomes, irrespective of whether they code for selenoproteins or not, suggesting that they are involved in additional, non-selenoprotein related functions. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Selenoproteins have been independently lost in several insect species, possibly as a consequence of the relaxation in insects of the selective constraints acting across metazoans to maintain selenoproteins. The dispensability of selenoproteins in insects may be related to the fundamental differences in antioxidant defense between these animals and other metazoans."

The sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) transport ATPase (SERCA2a) and its inhibitor phospholamban (PLN) control the uptake of Ca(2+) by SR membranes during relaxation. Recently, the antiapoptotic HS-1-associated protein X-1 (HAX-1) was identified as a binding partner of PLN, and this interaction was postulated to regulate cell apoptosis. In the current study, we determined that HAX-1 can also bind to SERCA2. Deletion mapping analysis demonstrated that amino acid residues 575-594 of SERCA2's nucleotide binding domain are required for its interaction with the C-terminal domain of HAX-1, containing amino acids 203-245. In transiently cotransfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells, recombinant SERCA2 was specifically targeted to the ER, whereas HAX-1 selectively concentrated at mitochondria. On triple transfections with PLN, however, HAX-1 massively translocated to the ER membranes, where it codistributed with PLN and SERCA2. Overexpression of SERCA2 abrogated the protective effects of HAX-1 on cell survival, after hypoxia/reoxygenation or thapsigargin treatment. Importantly, HAX-1 overexpression was associated with down-regulation of SERCA2 expression levels, resulting in significant reduction of apparent ER Ca(2+) levels. These findings suggest that HAX-1 may promote cell survival through modulation of SERCA2 protein levels and thus ER Ca(2+) stores."

Although the fundamental role for AUBPs and associated factors in eliciting ARE-dependent degradation of cognate mRNAs has been recently highlighted, the molecular mechanisms underlying the specific regulation of individual mRNA turnover have not yet been fully elucidated. Here we focused on the post-transcriptional regulation of bcl-2 mRNA in human cell lines under different conditions and genetic backgrounds. In the context of an AUBPs silencing approach, HuR knockdown reduced the expression of endogenous bcl-2, whereas unexpectedly, a bcl-2 ARE-reporter transcript increased significantly, suggesting that HuR expression has opposite effects on endogenous and ectopic bcl-2 ARE. Moreover, evidence was provided for the essential, specific and dose-dependent role of the Bcl-2 protein in regulating the decay kinetics of its own mRNA, as ascertained by a luciferase reporter system. Altogether, the data support a model whereby the Bcl-2 protein is the major determinant of its own ARE-dependent transcript half-life in living cells and its effect overcomes the activity of ARE-binding proteins."

Here we address this issue by analysing transcription termination at the end of single protein expressing genes and genes located within operons in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. By using a combination of RT-PCR and ChIP analysis we found that pol II generally transcribes up to 1 kb past the poly(A) sites into the 3' flanking regions of the nematode genes before it terminates. We also show that pol II does not terminate after transcription of internal poly(A) sites in operons. We provide experimental evidence that five randomly chosen C. elegans operons are transcribed as polycistronic pre-mRNAs. Furthermore, we show that cis-splicing of the first intron located in downstream positioned genes in these polycistronic pre-mRNAs is critical for their expression and may play a role in preventing premature pol II transcription termination."

Annexin-V (AnxV) has been shown to have high affinity to externalized phosphatidylserine. We hypothesized that (99m)Tc-AnxV will target high densities of apoptotic PMNs and image abscesses. AnxV, conjugated with hydrazinenicaotinamide (HYNIC), was labeled with reduced (99m)TcO(4)(-) and its purity was determined by instant thin-layer chromatography. Apoptosis was induced in isolated human PMNs by incubation in 2% saline for 17 and 22 h at 37 degrees C. PMNs were then incubated with (99m)Tc-HYNIC-AnxV and associated (99m)Tc was determined. Abscesses were induced in mice by intramuscular injection of bacteria or turpentine.

We now characterized the mitochondrial localization of STAT3 and its impact on respiration and MPTP opening. STAT3 was mainly present in the matrix of subsarcolemmal and interfibrillar cardiomyocyte mitochondria. STAT1, but not STAT5 was also detected in mitochondria under physiological conditions. ADP-stimulated respiration was reduced in mitochondria from mice with a cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of STAT3 (STAT3-KO) versus wildtypes and in rat mitochondria treated with the STAT3 inhibitor Stattic (STAT3 inhibitory compound, 6-Nitrobenzo[b]thiophene 1,1-dioxide). Mitochondria from STAT3-KO mice and Stattic-treated rat mitochondria tolerated less calcium until MPTP opening occurred. STAT3 co-immunoprecipitated with cyclophilin D, the target of the cardioprotective agent and MPTP inhibitor cyclosporine A (CsA).

MPs could be categorized into alpha-helical (AMP) and outer membrane proteins which mostly include beta barrel folds (OMBBs). The AMPs are relatively easy to predict from a protein sequence because they usually include several long membrane-spanning hydrophobic alpha-helices. The OMBBs play important roles in cell biology, they are targeted by multiple drugs, and they are more challenging to identify as they have shorter membrane-spanning regions which lack a folding pattern, that is, as consistent as in the case of the AMPs. Hence, accurate in silico methods for prediction of OMBBs from their primary sequences are needed. We present an accurate sequence-based predictor of OMBBs, called OMBBpred, which utilizes a Support Vector Machine classifier and a custom-designed set of 34 novel numerical descriptors derived from predicted secondary structures, hydrophobicity, and evolutionary information. Our method outperforms modern existing OMBB predictors and achieves accuracy of above 98% when tested on two existing benchmark datasets and 96% on a new large dataset. OMBBpred reduces the error rates of the second best method, depending on the dataset used, by between 13 and 65%, and generates predictions with high specificity of above 96%.

About 5% of individuals in the general population have a stuttering problem, and about 80% of the affected children recover naturally.

Anti-fibrinolytic drugs are widely used, particularly in cardiac surgery, and previous reviews have found them to be effective in reducing blood loss, the need for transfusion, and the need for re-operation due to continued or recurrent bleeding. In the last few years questions have been raised regarding the comparative performance of the drugs. The safety of the most popular agent, aprotinin, has been challenged, and it was withdrawn from world markets in May 2008 because of concerns that it increased the risk of cardiovascular complications and death. OBJECTIVES: To assess the comparative effects of the anti-fibrinolytic drugs aprotinin, tranexamic acid (TXA), and epsilon aminocaproic acid (EACA) on blood loss during surgery, the need for red blood cell (RBC) transfusion, and adverse events, particularly vascular occlusion, renal dysfunction, and death. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched: the Cochrane Injuries Group's Specialised Register (July 2010), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2010, Issue 3), MEDLINE (Ovid SP) 1950 to July 2010, EMBASE (Ovid SP) 1980 to July 2010. References in identified trials and review articles were checked and trial authors were contacted to identify any additional studies. The searches were last updated in July 2010. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of anti-fibrinolytic drugs in adults scheduled for non-urgent surgery. Eligible trials compared anti-fibrinolytic drugs with placebo (or no treatment), or with each other. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. MAIN RESULTS: This review summarises data from 252 RCTs that recruited over 25,000 participants. Data from the head-to-head trials suggest an advantage of aprotinin over the lysine analogues TXA and EACA in terms of reducing perioperative blood loss, but the differences were small. Compared to control, aprotinin reduced the probability of requiring RBC transfusion by a relative 34% (relative risk [RR] 0.66, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.60 to 0.72). The RR for RBC transfusion with TXA was 0.61 (95% CI 0.53 to 0.70) and was 0.81 (95% CI 0.67 to 0.99) with EACA. When the pooled estimates from the head-to-head trials of the two lysine analogues were combined and compared to aprotinin alone, aprotinin appeared more effective in reducing the need for RBC transfusion (RR 0.90; 95% CI 0.81 to 0.99).Aprotinin reduced the need for re-operation due to bleeding by a relative 54% (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.62). This translates into an absolute risk reduction of 2% and a number needed-to-treat (NNT) of 50 (95% CI 33 to 100). A similar trend was seen with EACA (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.99) but not TXA (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.17). The blood transfusion data were heterogeneous and funnel plots indicate that trials of aprotinin and the lysine analogues may be subject to publication bias.When compared with no treatment aprotinin did not increase the risk of myocardial infarction (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.11), stroke (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.52), renal dysfunction (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.54) or overall mortality (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.06). Similar trends were seen with the lysine analogues, but data were sparse. These data conflict with the results of recently published non-randomised studies, which found increased risk of cardiovascular complications and death with aprotinin. There are concerns about the adequacy of reporting of uncommon events in the small clinical trials included in this review.When aprotinin was compared directly with either, or both, of the two lysine analogues it resulted in a significant increase in the risk of death (RR 1.39, 95% CI 1.02, 1.89), and a non-significant increase in the risk of myocardial infarction (RR 1.11 95% CI 0.82, 1.50). Most of the data contributing to this added risk came from a single study - the BART trial (2008). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Anti-fibrinolytic drugs provide worthwhile reductions in blood loss and the receipt of allogeneic red cell transfusion. Aprotinin appears to be slightly more effective than the lysine analogues in reducing blood loss and the receipt of blood transfusion. However, head to head comparisons show a lower risk of death with lysine analogues when compared with aprotinin. The lysine analogues are effective in reducing blood loss during and after surgery, and appear to be free of serious adverse effects."

We report a case of rhinoorbital mucormycosis caused by Rhizopus oryzae in an acute lymphoblastic leukemia patient and review the 79 Mucormycosis cases reported in the last decade from Turkey. In our case, the diagnosis was made with endoscopic appearance, computerized tomography of the paranasal sinuses, and culture of the surgical materials. Following aggressive surgical debridement and parenteral amphotericin B therapy, the patient recovered completely. In Turkish literature, rhinocerebral manifestations were the most common form of the mucormycosis (64 cases), followed by pulmonary form (6 cases). The most common risk factor was hematologic malignancies (32 cases) and diabetes mellitus (32 cases), similar to those reported from the rest of the world. The etiologic agents responsible for the review cases were Rhizopus sp., Mucor spp., Rhizomucor spp., Rhizopus oryzae, Mucor circinelloides, and Lichtheimia corymbifera. Although various treatment modalities were used, amphotericin B was the mainstay of therapy. Mortality rate was found to be 49.4% in review cases. It seems that strong clinical suspicion and early diagnosis, along with aggressive antifungal therapy and endoscopic sinus surgery, have great importance for better prognosis in mucormycosis."

Mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2) is a kinase complex comprised of mTOR, Rictor, mSin1, mLST8/GbetaL and PRR5 and functions in the phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473. Herein, we report that mTORC2 plays an important role in PC3 androgen refractory prostate cell proliferation and anchorage-independent growth. Aloe-emodin, a natural compound found in aloe, inhibited both proliferation and anchorage-independent growth of PC3 cells. Protein content analysis suggested that activation of the downstream substrates of mTORC2, Akt and PKCalpha, was inhibited by aloe-emodin treatment. Pull-down assay and in vitro kinase assay results indicated that aloe-emodin could bind with mTORC2 in cells and inhibit its kinase activity. Aloe-emodin also exhibited tumor suppression effects in vivo in an athymic nude mouse model. Collectively, our data suggest that mTORC2 plays an important role in prostate cancer development and aloe-emodin suppresses prostate cancer progression by targeting mTORC2."

        "text": "A targeted therapy for protein and lipid kinases in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.\nProtein kinases (PKs) and lipid kinases (LKs) are good choices for targets of signal transduction therapy as these enzymes are involved in signaling pathways, and are often related to the pathogenesis of lymphoid malignancies. The attractiveness of PKs and LKs as drug able targets is enhanced by the fact that they are enzymes whose biological activity can be turned off by drugs that block their catalytic site. In the last few years small molecular kinase inhibitors (KIs) have been synthesized and become available for preclinical studies and clinical trials. The first KI, introduced into clinical practice in 1998, was imatinib mesylate, which became the first choice drug in chronic myeloid leukemia. More recently, several KIs have been developed to target the proximal B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathway including spleen tyrosine kinase inhibitor (Fostamatinib) and Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitors (Ibrutinib, AVL-263). These agents are currently evaluated in early clinical trials in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and other diseases. Cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibitors, flavopiridol (alvocidib), BMS-387032 (SNS-032), sunitinib and sorafenib are currently under evaluation in clinical trials for relapsed/refractory CLL. Multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitors including vandetanib (ZD6474) bosutinib (SKI-606), TKI258 (CHIR-258), pazopanib (GW786034) and axitinib (AG013736) have been also developed for the treatment of lymphoid malignancies. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3K ) are a family of lipid kinases that mediate signals from cell surface receptors. CAL-101 (GS-1101) is an oral PI3Kdelta-specific inhibitor which has shown preclinical and clinical activity against CLL. This article summarizes recent achievements in the mechanism of action, pharmacological properties and clinical activity and toxicity of PK and LK inhibitors in CLL."

DESIGN: Systematic review and random effects meta-analysis. Data were extracted independently by two investigators. An adjusted indirect comparison was performed to compare between novel oral anticoagulants. DATA SOURCES: Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library (from inception to April 2012). Hand searching of relevant scientific works and contact with experts. STUDY SELECTION: Randomised controlled trials of novel oral anticoagulants compared with vitamin K antagonists for acute venous thromboembolism. Selected outcomes were recurrent events, major bleeding, and all cause mortality. RESULTS: Nine studies met our inclusion criteria, involving 16,701 patients evaluated for efficacy and 16,611 for safety. Data were stratified according to different novel oral anticoagulants. For recurrent acute venous thromboembolism, there were no significant differences in events rates between any of the anticoagulants and conventional treatment (rivaroxaban (four studies): relative risk 0.85, 95% confidence interval 0.55 to 1.31; dabigatran (two studies): 1.09, 0.76 to 1.57; ximelagatran (two studies): 1.06, 0.62 to 1.80; and apixaban (one study): 0.98, 0.20 to 4.79). Rivaroxaban reduced the risk of major bleeding compared with conventional treatment (0.57, 0.39 to 0.84), whereas other novel oral anticoagulants did not (0.76 (0.49 to 1.18) for dabigatran; 0.54 (0.28 to 1.03) for ximelagatran; 2.95 (0.12 to 71.82) for apixaban). For all cause mortality there were no significant differences between the novel oral anticoagulants and conventional treatment (0.96 (0.72 to 1.27) for rivaroxaban; 1.00 (0.67 to 1.50) for dabigatran; 0.67 (0.42 to 1.08) for ximelagatran; 6.89 (0.36 to 132.06) for apixaban). The adjusted indirect comparison between rivaroxaban and dabigatran did not show superiority of either drug over the others for major bleeding (0.75, 0.41 to 1.34) or the other endpoints. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with vitamin K antagonists, the novel oral anticoagulants had a similar risk of recurrence of acute venous thromboembolism and all cause mortality, though rivaroxaban was associated with a reduced risk of bleeding."

Rates of cardiovascular disease are high and rising in many low- and middle-income countries. We studied the extent to which evidence on cardiovascular risk with NSAIDs has translated into guidance and sales in 15 countries. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Data on the relative risk (RR) of cardiovascular events with individual NSAIDs were derived from meta-analyses of randomised trials and controlled observational studies. Listing of individual NSAIDs on Essential Medicines Lists (EMLs) was obtained from the World Health Organization. NSAID sales or prescription data for 15 low-, middle-, and high-income countries were obtained from Intercontinental Medical Statistics Health (IMS Health) or national prescription pricing audit (in the case of England and Canada). Three drugs (rofecoxib, diclofenac, etoricoxib) ranked consistently highest in terms of cardiovascular risk compared with nonuse. Naproxen was associated with a low risk. Diclofenac was listed on 74 national EMLs, naproxen on just 27. Rofecoxib use was not documented in any country. Diclofenac and etoricoxib accounted for one-third of total NSAID usage across the 15 countries (median 33.2%, range 14.7-58.7%). This proportion did not vary between low- and high-income countries. Diclofenac was by far the most commonly used NSAID, with a market share close to that of the next three most popular drugs combined. Naproxen had an average market share of less than 10%. CONCLUSIONS: Listing of NSAIDs on national EMLs should take account of cardiovascular risk, with preference given to low risk drugs. Diclofenac has a risk very similar to rofecoxib, which was withdrawn from worldwide markets owing to cardiovascular toxicity. Diclofenac should be removed from EMLs."

There is a strong association between fibrinogen activity levels and clinical bleeding severity. Patients with afibrinogenemia experience frequent, often severe, spontaneous bleeds into the muscles and joints and are at significant risk of intracranial hemorrhage. Patients with hypofibrinogenemia are usually asymptomatic; however, they are vulnerable to bleeding after trauma. Dysfibrinogenemia is associated with both spontaneous bleeding and a relatively high risk of thrombosis. Fibrinogen replacement therapy is effective in treating bleeding episodes in congenital fibrinogen deficiency. Fibrinogen concentrates are the preferred treatment option and guidelines now exist for their on-demand use and to manage surgery. Prophylaxis may benefit patients with afibrinogenemia and others with a severe bleeding tendency. The dose and frequency of administration should be adjusted to maintain a fibrinogen activity level >0.5-1.0 g/L. Pregnant women with afibrinogenemia require prophylactic factor replacement as early as possible during pregnancy, continuing throughout pregnancy, and after the birth. Fibrinogen replacement should also be considered in pregnant women with other fibrinogen deficiencies. The risk of thrombosis presents an additional management challenge in these patients, often necessitating the concurrent use of anticoagulants and fibrinogen. Although basic guidelines have been developed, further studies are needed to help optimize treatment in different patient groups under different clinical circumstances and to improve our understanding of thrombotic events."

This chronic state is highly associated with the presence of gallstones in the gallbladder of infected carriers upon which Salmonella can form robust biofilms. However, we hypothesize that in addition to gallstones, the gallbladder epithelium aids in the establishment/maintenance of chronic carriage. In this work, we present evidence of the role of the gallbladder epithelium in chronic carriage by a mechanism involving invasion, intracellular persistence, and biofilm formation. Salmonella was able to adhere to and invade polarized gallbladder epithelial cells apically in the absence and presence of bile in a Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (SPI-1)-dependent manner. Intracellular replication of Salmonella was also evident at 12 and 24 h postinvasion. A flowthrough system revealed that Salmonella is able to adhere to and form extensive bacterial foci on gallbladder epithelial cells as early as 12 h postinoculation. In vivo experiments using a chronic mouse model of typhoid carriage showed invasion and damage of the gallbladder epithelium and lamina propria up to 2 months after Salmonella infection, with an abundant presence of macrophages, a relative absence of neutrophils, and extrusion of infected epithelial cells. Additionally, microcolonies of Salmonella cells were evident on the surface of the mouse gallbladder epithelia up to 21 days postinfection. These data reveal a second potential mechanism, intracellular persistence and/or bacterial aggregation in/on the gallbladder epithelium with luminal cell extrusion, for Salmonella maintenance in the gallbladder.

We assessed the impact of some of these equations on estimated GFR (eGFR) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) prevalence, and on the association with cardiovascular risk factors, in a general population sample characterized by a young mean age. METHODS: We studied 1,199 individuals from three Alpine villages enrolled into the MICROS study. eGFR was obtained with the 4- and 6-parameter MDRD study equations, the Virga equation, and with the three CKD-EPI formulas for creatinine, cystatin C, and the combination of creatinine and cystatin C. We assessed the concordance between quantitative eGFR levels, CKD prevalence, and in terms of association with total, LDL, and HDL cholesterol. RESULTS: The highest and lowest eGFR levels corresponded to the cystatin C-based and MDRD-4 equations, respectively. CKD prevalence varied from 1.8% (Virga) to 5.8% (MDRD-4). The CKD-EPI based on creatinine showed the highest agreement with all other equations. Agreement between methods was higher at lower eGFR levels, older age, and in the presence of diabetes and hypertension. Creatinine-based estimates of eGFR were associated with total and low-density lipoprotein but not high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. The opposite was observed for the cystatin C-based GFR. CONCLUSION: GFR estimation is strongly affected by the chosen equation. Differences are more pronounced in healthy and younger individuals. To identify CKD risk factors, the choice of the equation is of secondary importance to the choice of the biomarker used in the formula. If eGFR is not calibrated to a gold standard GFR in the general population, reports about CKD prevalence should be considered with caution."

These checkpoints might include effects of programmed cell death 1 (PD1), a co-inhibitory receptor that impairs T-cell function and is highly expressed on intratumoral T cells. We did this phase 2 trial to investigate the activity of pidilizumab, a humanised anti-PD1 monoclonal antibody, with rituximab in patients with relapsed follicular lymphoma. METHODS: We did this open-label, non-randomised trial at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX, USA). Adult (>=18 years) patients with rituximab-sensitive follicular lymphoma relapsing after one to four previous therapies were eligible. Pidilizumab was administered at 3 mg/kg intravenously every 4 weeks for four infusions, plus eight optional infusions every 4 weeks for patients with stable disease or better. Starting 17 days after the first infusion of pidilizumab, rituximab was given at 375 mg/m(2) intravenously weekly for 4 weeks. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved an objective response (complete response plus partial response according to Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma). Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00904722. FINDINGS: We enrolled 32 patients between Jan 13, 2010, and Jan 20, 2012. Median follow-up was 15.4 months (IQR 10.1-21.0). The combination of pidilizumab and rituximab was well tolerated, with no autoimmune or treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or 4. The most common adverse events of grade 1 were anaemia (14 patients) and fatigue (13 patients), and the most common adverse event of grade 2 was respiratory infection (five patients). Of the 29 patients evaluable for activity, 19 (66%) achieved an objective response: complete responses were noted in 15 (52%) patients and partial responses in four (14%). INTERPRETATION: The combination of pidilizumab plus rituximab is well tolerated and active in patients with relapsed follicular lymphoma. Our results suggest that immune checkpoint blockade is worthy of further study in follicular lymphoma.

DBA has been associated with mutations and deletions in the large and small ribosomal protein genes, and genetic aberrations have been detected in ~50-60% of patients. In this study, nine Korean DBA patients were screened for mutations in eight known DBA genes (RPS19, RPS24, RPS17, RPS10, RPS26, RPL35A, RPL5 and RPL11) using the direct sequencing method. Mutations in RPS19, RPS26 and RPS17 were detected in four, two and one patient, respectively. Among the mutations detected in RPS19, two mutations were novel (c.26T>A, c.357-2A>G). For the mutation-negative cases, array-CGH analysis was performed to identify copy-number variations, and no deletions involving the known DBA gene regions were identified. The relative mRNA expression of RPS19 estimated using real-time quantitative PCR analysis revealed two- to fourfold reductions in RPS19 mRNA expression in three patients with RPS19 mutations, and p53 protein expression analysis by immunohistochemistry showed variable but significant nuclear staining in the DBA patients. In conclusion, heterozygous mutations in the known DBA genes RPS19, RPS26 and RPS17 were detected in seven out of nine Korean DBA patients. Among these patients, RPS19 was the most frequently mutated gene. In addition, decreased RPS19 mRNA expression and p53 overexpression were observed in the Korean DBA patients, which supports the hypothesis that haploinsufficiency and p53 hyperactivation represent a central pathway underlying the pathogenesis of DBA.

In intact SHSY5Y (human neuroblastoma cell line) cells, lactacystin (5 muM), a proteasomal inhibitor, causes an accumulation of alpha-synuclein with concomitant mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death. The effects of lactacystin on intact SHSY5Y cells are, however, prevented by knocking down alpha-synuclein expression by specific siRNA. Furthermore, in wild-type (non-transfected) SHSY5Y cells, the effects of lactacystin on mitochondrial function and cell viability are also prevented by cyclosporin A (1 muM) which blocks the activity of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. Likewise, in wild-type SHSY5Y cells, typical mitochondrial poison like antimycin A (50 nM) produces loss of cell viability comparable to that of lactacystin (5 muM). These data, in combination with those from isolated brain mitochondria, strongly suggest that intracellularly accumulated alpha-synuclein can interact with mitochondria in intact SHSY5Y cells causing dysfunction of the organelle which drives the cell death under our experimental conditions. The results have clear implications in the pathogenesis of sporadic Parkinson's disease. alpha-Synuclein is shown to cause mitochondrial impairment through interaction with permeability transition pore complex in isolated preparations. Intracellular accumulation of alpha-synuclein in SHSY5Y cells following proteasomal inhibition leads to mitochondrial impairment and cell death which could be prevented by knocking down alpha-synuclein gene. The results link mitochondrial dysfunction and alpha-synuclein accumulation, two key pathogenic mechanisms of Parkinson's disease, in a common damage pathway."

We aimed to replicate the association of these genes with SLE in Chinese Han and to search for possible gene-gene interactions. METHODS: TaqMan single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping was used to detect rs548234, rs665791 in ATG5, rs11706903 in ATG7, rs2736340 in BLK and rs10516487 in BANK1 in 382 SLE patients and 660 healthy controls. The epistasis effect was analyzed by logistic regression, multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) and linear regression analysis. RESULTS: SLE was associated with frequency of rs548234 (P = 0.010; odds ratio [OR] = 1.298), rs2736340 (P = 2.47 x 10-5 ; OR = 1.574) and rs10516487 (P = 0.002; OR = 0.642).

The present review focuses on the role of EpCAM in physiology and homeostasis of epithelia. Recent research pointed to a close interaction of EpCAM with other cell-cell contact molecules like E-cadherin and claudins and an intimate crosstalk with Wnt and TGF-beta signaling in the regulation of cell growth. Moreover, EpCAM has been shown to modulate trans-epithelial migration processes of white blood cells. Mutations of the EpCAM gene lead to disturbances of epithelial homeostasis and cellular differentiation from the stem cell compartment. In the intestinal tract EpCAM mutations contribute to congenital tufting enteropathy. Regarding tumorigenesis EpCAM can act as an oncogene still depending on additional driver mutations and epithelial phenotype of tumor cells. Tumor cells display increased EpCAM expression that often correlates with the loss of strict basolateral localization. Many tumors show enhanced regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP) of EpCAM and loose EpCAM expression under conditions of epithelial to mesenchymal transition. The resulting extracellular EpEX and intracellular EpICD fragments mediate proliferative signals to the cell. Resulting fragments can be validated either by sensitive enzyme-linked immune-sandwich assays (EpEX) or by immunohistochemistry (EpICD). The present review gives an overview on the detection of EpCAM fragments as predictive markers for disease progression and survival of cancer patients. "

The bacterium causing typhoid fever can live in the gallstones of asymptomatic persons after the infection. These carriers are reservoirs of S. Typhi, are highly contagious, and spread the disease through the secretion of bacteria in feces and urine. The aim of this study was to determine the carrier rate in an area of Mozambique. METHODOLOGY: The presence of S. Typhi was analyzed in gallbladder samples obtained from 99 adult corpses (in-hospital deaths) from Mozambique by gold-standard culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: Only one sample was positive with the culture. However, nine additional samples were positive by PCR and confirmed by DNA sequencing. Thus, the prevalence of S. Typhi was 10.1% (10/99). CONCLUSIONS: We report a high prevalence of S. Typhi in gallbladders among adult autopsy cases from Mozambique."

Approximately 10% to 15% of ameloblastomas occur in patients younger than 18 years. Although it is a benign tumor, an ameloblastoma can have a devastating effect on children both physically and emotionally. The aim of this case report is to demonstrate how tissue engineering and surgical techniques can minimize morbidity and recovery time after extirpation and immediate reconstruction of a mandibular ameloblastoma. CASE DESCRIPTION: An 11-year-old girl was referred for surgical evaluation of a lesion found on a routine dental radiograph. Resection of a mandibular unicystic ameloblastoma resulted, including immediate reconstruction using a costochondral rib graft, allogeneic bone, bone marrow aspirate concentrate, and recombinant human morphogenetic protein-2. One year postoperatively, the patient had no evidence of recurrence as well as excellent mandibular bone height and width with good facial form. The patient has returned to her daily life without any disabilities or disfigurement. CONCLUSIONS AND PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Dentists are typically the first health care providers to discover oral pathology in patients. The coordination of care by the dental care providers and the oral and maxillofacial specialist was key to the successful outcome for this patient. With biotechnology and surgical techniques, the dental surgeon can extirpate an ameloblastoma and reconstruct the mandible defect to the ideal shape and size with minimal morbidity and recovery time."

This narrative review summarizes pharmacological, efficacy and tolerability data relevant to the use of saxagliptin/dapagliflozin in this indication. The agents have complementary mechanisms of action, and saxagliptin/dapagliflozin fixed-dose combination tablets are bioequivalent to free combination of saxagliptin + dapagliflozin. In three phase III trials, saxagliptin + dapagliflozin + metformin was more effective at providing glycaemic control than saxagliptin + metformin or dapagliflozin + metformin in previously treated patients with T2DM and inadequate glycaemic control on metformin monotherapy or metformin plus one of the monocomponents. The combination is associated with decreased bodyweight and a low risk of hypoglycaemia. As the first dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor/sodium-glucose co-transporter (SGLT2) inhibitor fixed-dose combination available in the EU for glycaemic control in patients with T2DM, saxagliptin/dapagliflozin is a useful new option in this setting."

Potential immunomodulatory, antiinflammatory, anti-angiogenic and sedative properties make thalidomide a good candidate for the treatment of several diseases such as multiple myeloma. Through an increase in the degradation of TNFalpha-mRNA, thalidomide reduces the production of TNFalpha by monocytes and macrophages stimulated by lipopolysaccharide or by T lymphocytes induced by mitogenic stimuli. The decreased level of TNFalpha alters the mechanisms of intracellular transduction by preventing the activation of NF-kB and by decreasing the synthesis of proteins, in particular IL-6, involved in cell proliferation, inflammation, angiogenesis and protection from apoptosis. Furthermore, thalidomide affects VEGF levels by down-regulating its expression. Nowadays, new safer and less toxic drugs, analogs of thalidomide, are emerging as beneficial for a more targeted treatment of multiple myeloma and several other diseases such as Crohn';s disease, rheumatoid arthritis, sarcoidosis, erythema nodosum leprosum, graft-versus-host disease."

RNA-Seq based quantification at whole-gene resolution, where abundance is estimated by culminating expression of all transcripts or exons of the same gene, is likely to account for this observed lack of colocalisation as subtle isoform switches and expression variation in independent exons can be concealed. We performed integrative cis-eQTL analysis using association statistics from twenty autoimmune diseases (560 independent loci) and RNA-Seq data from 373 individuals of the Geuvadis cohort profiled at gene-, isoform-, exon-, junction-, and intron-level resolution in lymphoblastoid cell lines. After stringently testing for a shared causal variant using both the Joint Likelihood Mapping and Regulatory Trait Concordance frameworks, we found that gene-level quantification significantly underestimated the number of causal cis-eQTLs. Only 5.0-5.3% of loci were found to share a causal cis-eQTL at gene-level compared to 12.9-18.4% at exon-level and 9.6-10.5% at junction-level. More than a fifth of autoimmune loci shared an underlying causal variant in a single cell type by combining all five quantification types; a marked increase over current estimates of steady-state causal cis-eQTLs. Causal cis-eQTLs detected at different quantification types localised to discrete epigenetic annotations. We applied a linear mixed-effects model to distinguish cis-eQTLs modulating all expression elements of a gene from those where the signal is only evident in a subset of elements. Exon-level analysis detected disease-associated cis-eQTLs that subtly altered transcription globally across the target gene. We dissected in detail the genetic associations of systemic lupus erythematosus and functionally annotated the candidate genes. Many of the known and novel genes were concealed at gene-level (e.g. IKZF2, TYK2, LYST). Our findings are provided as a web resource."

We investigated the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) of a single 10-mg oral dose of [14C]siponimod in four healthy men. Mass balance, blood and plasma radioactivity, and plasma siponimod concentrations were measured. Metabolite profiles were determined in plasma, urine, and feces. Metabolite structures were elucidated using mass spectrometry and comparison with reference compounds. Unchanged siponimod accounted for 57% of the total plasma radioactivity (area under the concentration-time curve), indicating substantial exposure to metabolites. Siponimod showed medium to slow absorption (median Tmax: 4 hours) and moderate distribution (Vz/F: 291 l). Siponimod was mainly cleared through biotransformation, predominantly by oxidative metabolism. The mean apparent elimination half-life of siponimod in plasma was 56.6 hours. Siponimod was excreted mostly in feces in the form of oxidative metabolites. The excretion of radioactivity was close to complete after 13 days. Based on the metabolite patterns, a phase II metabolite (M3) formed by glucuronidation of hydroxylated siponimod was the main circulating metabolite in plasma. However, in subsequent mouse ADME and clinical pharmacokinetic studies, a long-lived nonpolar metabolite (M17, cholesterol ester of siponimod) was identified as the most prominent systemic metabolite. We further conducted in vitro experiments to investigate the enzymes responsible for the oxidative metabolism of siponimod. The selective inhibitor and recombinant enzyme results identified cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) as the predominant contributor to the human liver microsomal biotransformation of siponimod, with minor contributions from CYP3A4 and other cytochrome P450 enzymes."

Here we provide a comparative analysis of the evolution and function of lysozymes during early development in fish, the most speciose vertebrate group. In fishes, lineage and species-specific evolution of both C-type (chicken or conventional) and G-type (goose type) genes occurred. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the teleost lysozyme G-type members group with the tetrapod homologues but the teleost C-type form three different clusters with the tetrapods. Most of the teleost C-type cluster with tetrapod Lyz but there are some that group with the mammalian Lyzl1/2 and LALBA. This suggests that early in gnathostome evolution these genes already existed and that lyzl1/2 and lalba genes are present in fish and tetrapods. Gene synteny analysis to confirm sequence orthologies failed to identify conserved genome regions between teleosts and other vertebrates lysozyme gene regions suggesting that in the ancestral bony fish genome lyz, lyzl1/2, lalba and lyg precursor genes were transposed to different chromosome regions. The homologue of the mammalian lactalbumin (LALBA) gene was identified for the first time in teleosts and was expressed in skin and during egg and larval development. Lysozyme activity was detected in teleost eggs and varied between species and in the gilthead sea bream lyg and lalba transcript abundance differed in eggs and larvae from different brood stock suggesting differences exist in maternal innate immune protection."

The effect of VX-548, an oral, highly selective inhibitor of NaV1.8, on control of acute pain is being studied. METHODS: After establishing the selectivity of VX-548 for NaV1.8 inhibition in vitro, we conducted two phase 2 trials involving participants with acute pain after abdominoplasty or bunionectomy. In the abdominoplasty trial, participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive one of the following over a 48-hour period: a 100-mg oral loading dose of VX-548, followed by a 50-mg maintenance dose every 12 hours (the high-dose group); a 60-mg loading dose of VX-548, followed by a 30-mg maintenance dose every 12 hours (the middle-dose group); hydrocodone bitartrate-acetaminophen (5 mg of hydrocodone bitartrate and 325 mg of acetaminophen every 6 hours); or oral placebo every 6 hours. In the bunionectomy trial, participants were randomly assigned in a 2:2:1:2:2 ratio to receive one of the following over a 48-hour treatment period: oral high-dose VX-548; middle-dose VX-548; low-dose VX-548 (a 20-mg loading dose, followed by a 10-mg maintenance dose every 12 hours); oral hydrocodone bitartrate-acetaminophen (5 mg of hydrocodone bitartrate and 325 mg of acetaminophen every 6 hours); or oral placebo every 6 hours. The primary end point was the time-weighted sum of the pain-intensity difference (SPID) over the 48-hour period (SPID48), a measure derived from the score on the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (range, 0 to 10; higher scores indicate greater pain) at 19 time points after the first dose of VX-548 or placebo. The main analysis compared each dose of VX-548 with placebo. RESULTS: A total of 303 participants were enrolled in the abdominoplasty trial and 274 in the bunionectomy trial. The least-squares mean difference between the high-dose VX-548 and placebo groups in the time-weighted SPID48 was 37.8 (95% confidence interval [CI], 9.2 to 66.4) after abdominoplasty and 36.8 (95% CI, 4.6 to 69.0) after bunionectomy. In both trials, participants who received lower doses of VX-548 had results similar to those with placebo. Headache and constipation were common adverse events with VX-548. CONCLUSIONS: As compared with placebo, VX-548 at the highest dose, but not at lower doses, reduced acute pain over a period of 48 hours after abdominoplasty or bunionectomy. VX-548 was associated with adverse events that were mild to moderate in severity.

We have investigated the role of the yaa gene in the development of the type II collagen (CII)-induced arthritis (CIA), which is used as a model for rheumatoid arthritis. In contrast to the accelerating effects on development of lupus autoimmunity we can show that the presence of BXSB Y chromosome carrying the yaa gene block development of CIA in F1 crosses with three normally CIA-susceptible strains, DBA/1, C3H.Q and B10.Q. Backcross experiments showed an additional modulatory effect from other BXSB genes or possibly from DBA/1 X chromosome. To evaluate the effect mediated by the yaa gene alone, the BXSB Y chromosome was bred into the DBA/1 gene background. The DBA/1 congenic DBA/1.yaa male mice were less susceptible to arthritis development than their DBA/1 counterparts. (B10.QxDBA/1.yaa)F1 acquired resistance to arthritis development similar to that of DBA/1.yaa, indicating a role for the yaa gene alone.

As yet it is not known whether transcription is initiated by promotors at specific start sites or is distributed non-specifically over the whole circle. An in vitro transcription extract was prepared from a non-infected potato cell culture which exhibited transcriptional activity using added circular PSTVd (+)-strand RNA as template. In accordance with pol II activity, transcription could be inhibited by alpha-amanitin.

The sequences of the first 7 nt transcribed are very similar, (105)GGAGCGA(111) and (319)GGGGCGA(325). GC-boxes are located at a distance of 15 and 16 nt upstream, respectively, in the native viroid structure, which may act to facilitate initiation. The GC-boxes may have a similar function to the GC-rich hairpin II in the (-)-strand intermediate, as described previously.

The aim of the present study was to assess the long-term clinical and morphological evolution of medically treated IMH. METHODS AND RESULTS: Fifty of 68 consecutive patients with aortic IMH monitored clinically and by imaging techniques at 3, 6, and 12 months and annually thereafter were prospectively studied. Mean follow-up was 45+/-31 months. In the first 6 months, total IMH regression was observed in 14 and progression to aortic dissection in 18 patients; in 14 of these, the dissection was localized, and 12 later developed pseudoaneurysm. At the end of follow-up, the IMH had regressed completely without dilatation in 17 patients (34%), progressed to classical dissection in 6 (12%), evolved to fusiform aneurysm in 11 (22%), evolved to saccular aneurysm in 4 (8%), and evolved to pseudoaneurysm in 12 (24%). Evolution to dissection was related to echolucency (P<0.02) and to longitudinal extension of IMH (P<0.01). Multivariate analysis showed an independent association between regression and smaller maximum aortic diameter and between aneurysm formation and atherosclerotic ulcerated plaque and absence of echolucent areas in IMH. CONCLUSIONS: The most frequent long-term evolution of IMH is to aortic aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm. Complete regression without changes in aorta size is observed in one third of cases, and progression to classical dissection is less common. A normal aortic diameter in the acute phase is the best predictor of IMH regression without complications, and absence of echolucent areas and atherosclerotic ulcerated plaque are associated with evolution to aortic aneurysm."

However, with the onset of pregnancy, the corpus luteum is rescued and stromal cells, instead of undergoing apoptosis, reorganize the cytoskeleton and then begin to differentiate. We hypothesized that in the presence of hormones (estradiol-17beta and medroxyprogesterone acetate), chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) as an early embryonic signal, and induction of decidualization by dibutyryl-cAMP (dbcAMP), endometrial stromal cells are rescued by the regulation of proteins that inhibit apoptosis. The percentage of cells stained with annexin V, an early apoptotic marker, increased dramatically after cytoskeletal disruption with cytochalasin D compared with non-cytochalasin-D-treated controls (P < 0.05). However, treatment of cells with hCG or dbcAMP in the presence of hormones significantly (P < 0.05) decreased the percentage of annexin-V-stained cells compared with cells treated with cytochalasin D alone. This inhibition was further confirmed by immunodetection of cleaved caspase-3 and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling staining. The inhibition of apoptosis by hCG and dbcAMP was via the intrinsic pathway because the cytochalasin-D-treated cells stained intensely for Bax, whereas the cells treated with hormones, hCG, or dbcAMP stained predominantly for Bcl-2. Treatment of cytochalasin-D-treated cells with hormones and dbcAMP resulted in an increase in the secretion of IGF-binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) and prolactin. Treatment of cytochalasin-D-treated cells with recombinant IGFBP-1 and prolactin also inhibited apoptosis. These data suggest that under in vitro conditions, both hCG and the induction of decidualization play a direct role in preventing uterine stromal cells from undergoing apoptosis. Furthermore, this inhibition of apoptosis may be mediated in part by IGFBP-1 and prolactin and the alteration in the expression of Bcl-2 and Bax."

The signal transduction pathways underlying these effects are just beginning to be defined. We demonstrated that thyroid hormone T3 rapidly induces Akt activation in pancreatic beta cells rRINm5F and hCM via thyroid hormone receptor (TR) beta1. The phosphorylation of Akt was T3 specific and dependent. Coimmunoprecipitation and colocalization experiments revealed that the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) p85alpha subunit and the thyroid receptor beta1 were able to form a complex at the cytoplasmic level in both the cell lines, suggesting that a 'cytoplasmic TRbeta1' was implicated. Moreover, we evidenced that T3 treatment was able to induce kinase activity of the TRbeta1-associated PI3K. The silencing of TRbeta1 expression through RNAi confirmed this receptor to be crucial for the T3-induced activation of Akt. This action involved a T3-induced nuclear translocation of activated Akt, as demonstrated by confocal immunofluorescence. In summary, T3 is able to specifically activate Akt in the islet beta cells rRINm5F and hCM through the interaction between TRbeta1 and PI3K p85alpha, demonstrating the involvement of TRbeta1 in this novel T3 non-genomic action in islet beta cells."

METHODS AND FINDINGS: We prospectively recruited patients between 2002 and 2005. Clinicians assessed patients and drew blood for inflammatory markers. Patients were followed up by postal questionnaire for poor outcome (a score of>2 on the modified Rankin Scale) and death through the General Register Office (Scotland) at 6 mo. We performed a systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis of the association between interleukin-6 and poor outcome after stroke to place our study in the context of previous research. We recruited 844 patients; mortality data were available in 844 (100%) and functional outcome in 750 (89%). After appropriate adjustment, the odds ratios for the association of markers and poor outcome (comparing the upper and the lower third) were interleukin-6, 3.1 (95% CI: 1.9-5.0); C-reactive protein, 1.9 (95% CI: 1.2-3.1); fibrinogen, 1.5 (95% CI: 1.0-2.36); white cell count, 2.1 (95% CI: 1.3-3.4); and glucose 1.3 (95% CI: 0.8-2.1). The results for interleukin-6 were similar to other studies. However, the addition of inflammatory marker levels to validated prognostic models did not materially improve model discrimination, calibration, or reclassification for prediction of poor outcome after stroke. CONCLUSIONS: Raised levels of markers of the acute inflammatory response after stroke are associated with poor outcomes. However, the addition of these markers to a previously validated stroke prognostic model did not improve the prediction of poor outcome. Whether inflammatory markers are useful in prediction of recurrent stroke or other vascular events is a separate question, which requires further study.

Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) have been implicated in disease associations through overlaps between eQTLs and GWAS signals. However, the abundance of eQTLs and the strong correlation structure (LD) in the genome make it likely that some of these overlaps are coincidental and not driven by the same functional variants. In the present study, we propose an empirical methodology, which we call Regulatory Trait Concordance (RTC) that accounts for local LD structure and integrates eQTLs and GWAS results in order to reveal the subset of association signals that are due to cis eQTLs. We simulate genomic regions of various LD patterns with both a single or two causal variants and show that our score outperforms SNP correlation metrics, be they statistical (r(2)) or historical (D'). Following the observation of a significant abundance of regulatory signals among currently published GWAS loci, we apply our method with the goal to prioritize relevant genes for each of the respective complex traits. We detect several potential disease-causing regulatory effects, with a strong enrichment for immunity-related conditions, consistent with the nature of the cell line tested (LCLs). Furthermore, we present an extension of the method in trans, where interrogating the whole genome for downstream effects of the disease variant can be informative regarding its unknown primary biological effect. We conclude that integrating cellular phenotype associations with organismal complex traits will facilitate the biological interpretation of the genetic effects on these traits."

We previously showed that the single amino acid difference between human and mouse PLN results in increased inhibition of Ca(2+) cycling and cardiac remodeling and attenuated stress responses in transgenic mice expressing the human PLN (hPLN) in the null background. Here we dissect the molecular and electrophysiological processes triggered by the superinhibitory hPLN in the mouse. Using a multidisciplinary approach, we performed global gene expression analysis, electrophysiology, and mathematical simulations on hPLN mice. We identified significant changes in a series of Na(+) and K(+) homeostasis genes/proteins (including Kcnd2, Scn9a, Slc8a1) and ionic conductance (including L-type Ca(2+) current, Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger, transient outward K(+) current). Simulation analysis suggests that this electrical remodeling has a critical role in rescuing cardiac function by improving sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) load and overall Ca(2+) dynamics. Furthermore, multiple structural and transcription factor gene expression changes indicate an ongoing structural remodeling process, favoring hypertrophy and myogenesis while suppressing apoptosis and progression to heart failure. Our findings expand current understanding of the hPLN function and provide additional insights into the downstream implications of SERCA2a superinhibition in the mammalian heart."

We first discovered that abnormal myelin hypercitrullination, even in normal-appearing white matter, by peptidylarginine deiminases (PADs) correlates strongly with disease severity and might have an important role in MS progression. Hypercitrullination is known to promote focal demyelination through reduced myelin compaction. Here we report that 2-chloroacetamidine (2CA), a small-molecule, PAD active-site inhibitor, dramatically attenuates disease at any stage in independent neurodegenerative as well as autoimmune MS mouse models. 2CA reduced PAD activity and protein citrullination to pre-disease status. In the autoimmune models, disease induction uniformly induced spontaneous hypercitrullination with citrulline+ epitopes targeted frequently. 2CA rapidly suppressed T cell autoreactivity, clearing brain and spinal cord infiltrates, through selective removal of newly activated T cells. 2CA essentially prevented disease when administered before disease onset or before autoimmune induction, making hypercitrullination, and specifically PAD enzymes, a therapeutic target in MS models and thus possibly in MS."

A comprehensive review of the literature.\nIn those predisposed to the development of diabetes (the insulin resistant, obese and older patients) statins may increase the risk of developing diabetes. Despite the fact that the conversion to diabetes is generated from post hoc analyses, it seems to be a class effect with a dose-response relationship. However, statins have not been clearly shown to increase diabetic microvascular complications (retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy). Thus, the clinical significance of increased glucose levels in patients treated on statins is uncertain. While the exact mechanism for how statins increase the risk of diabetes is unknown, a possible explanation is through a reduction in adiponectin levels. Despite the fact that higher statin doses are more likely to lead to new-onset diabetes, for every case of diabetes caused, there are approximately three cardiovascular events reduced with high dose versus moderate dose statin therapy. Overall, the small risk of developing type 2 diabetes with statin therapy is far outweighed by the potential of statins to decrease cardiac events. "

TBI can induce glutamate excitotoxicity and lead to neuronal and glial cell death. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of cell death during the secondary damage caused by TBI in vivo and in vitro, as well as the protective effect of resveratrol (RV). Here we report that glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) activation and microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 processing were induced in rat brains exposed to TBI. In the in vitro TBI model, apoptotic and autophagic cell death were induced through glutamate-mediated GSK-3beta activation in normal CTX TNA2 astrocytes. The GSK-3beta inhibitor SB216763 or transfection of GSK-3beta small-interfering RNA increases cell survival. By contrast, overexpression of GSK-3beta enhanced glutamate excitotoxicity. Administration of RV reduced cell death in CTX TNA2 astrocytes by suppressing reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated GSK-3beta activation, the mechanism by which RV also exerted protective effects in vivo. Mitochondrial damages, including the opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) and mitochondrial depolarization, were induced by glutamate through the ROS/GSK-3beta pathway. Moreover, cyclosporine A, an MPTP inhibitor, suppressed mitochondrial damage and the percentages of cells undergoing autophagy and apoptosis and thereby increased cell survival. Taken together, our results demonstrated that cell death occurring after TBI is induced through the ROS/GSK-3beta/mitochondria signaling pathway and that administration of RV can increase cell survival by suppressing GSK-3beta-mediated autophagy and apoptosis. Therefore, the results indicated that resveratrol may serve as a potential therapeutic agent in the treatment of TBI. "

Ongoing clinical trials are assessing the efficacy of rucaparib alone or in combination with other cytotoxic drugs, mainly in breast and ovarian cancer patients with mutations in the breast cancer associated (BRCA) genes. PURPOSE: We aimed to establish whether the multidrug efflux transporters ABCG2 (BCRP) and ABCB1 (P-gp, MDR1) affect the oral availability and brain penetration of rucaparib in mice. RESULTS: In vitro, rucaparib was efficiently transported by both human ABCB1 and ABCG2, and very efficiently by mouse Abcg2. Transport could be inhibited by the small-molecule ABCB1 and ABCG2 inhibitors zosuquidar and Ko143, respectively. In vivo, oral availability (plasma AUC0-1 and AUC0-24) and brain levels of rucaparib at 1 and 24 h were increased by the absence of both Abcg2 and Abcb1a/1b after oral administration of rucaparib at 10 mg/kg. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show to our knowledge for the first time that oral availability and brain accumulation of a PARP inhibitor are markedly and additively restricted by Abcg2 and Abcb1a/1b. This may have clinical relevance for improvement of rucaparib therapy in PARP inhibitor-resistant tumors with ABCB1 and/or ABCG2 expression and in patients with brain (micro)metastases positioned behind a functional blood-brain barrier."

Here we report cross-sectional baseline data to establish the biological and clinical characteristics for a prospective, international, European Friedreich's ataxia database registry. METHODS: Within the European Friedreich's Ataxia Consortium for Translational Studies (EFACTS) framework, we assessed a cohort of patients with genetically confirmed Friedreich's ataxia. The primary outcome measure was the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) and secondary outcome measures were the Inventory of Non-Ataxia Signs (INAS), the performance-based coordination test Spinocerebellar Ataxia Functional Index (SCAFI), the neurocognitive phonemic verbal fluency test, and two quality-of-life measures: the activities of daily living (ADL) part of the Friedreich's Ataxia Rating Scale and EQ-5D. The Friedreich's ataxia cohort was subdivided into three groups: early disease onset (<=14 years), intermediate onset (15-24 years), and late onset (>=25 years), which were compared for clinical characteristics and outcome measures. We used linear regression analysis to estimate the annual decline of clinical outcome measures based on disease duration. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02069509. FINDINGS: We enrolled 592 patients with genetically confirmed Friedreich's ataxia between Sept 15, 2010, and April 30, 2013, at 11 sites in seven European countries. Age of disease onset was inversely correlated with the number of GAA repeats in the frataxin (FXN) gene: every 100 GAA repeats on the smaller repeat allele was associated with a 2 3 year (SE 0 2) earlier onset. Regression analyses showed significant estimated annual worsening of SARA (regression coefficient 0 86 points [SE 0 05], INAS (0 14 points [0 01]), SCAFI Z scores (-0 09 [0 01]), verbal fluency (-0 34 words [0 07]), and ADL (0 64 points [0 04]) during the first 25 years of disease; the regression slope for health-related quality-of-life state from EQ-5D was not significant (-0 33 points [0 18]). For SARA, the predicted annual rate of worsening was significantly higher in early-onset patients (n=354; 1 04 points [0 13]) and intermediate-onset patients (n=137; 1 17 points [0 22]) than in late-onset patients (n=100; 0 56 points [0 10]). INTERPRETATION: The results of this cross-sectional baseline analysis of the EFACTS cohort suggest that earlier disease onset is associated with larger numbers of GAA repeats and more rapid disease progression. The differential estimated progression of ataxia symptoms related to age of onset have implications for the design of clinical trials in Friedreich's ataxia, for which SARA might be the most suitable measure to monitor disease progression.

However, molecular mechanisms of B cell-specific expression of Pax5 are not fully understood. Here, we applied insertional chromatin immunoprecipitation (iChIP) combined with stable isotope labeling using amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) (iChIP-SILAC) to direct identification of proteins interacting with the promoter region of the endogenous single-copy chicken Pax5 gene. By comparing B cells with macrophage-like cells trans-differentiated by ectopic expression of C/EBPbeta, iChIP-SILAC detected B cell-specific interaction of a nuclear protein, Thy28/Thyn1, with the Pax5 1A promoter. Trans-differentiation of B cells into macrophage-like cells caused down-regulation of Thy28 expression. Loss-of-function of Thy28 induced decrease in Pax5 expression and recruitment of myosin-9 (MYH9), one of Thy28-interacting proteins, to the Pax5 1A promoter. Loss-of-function of MYH9 also induced decrease in Pax5 expression. Thus, our analysis revealed that Thy28 is functionally required for B cell-specific expression of Pax5 via recruitment of MYH9 to the Pax5 locus in chicken B cells. "

A cadaver of a mature female was imaged by MRI using specific sequences as the Spin-echo (SE) T1-weighting and Gradient-echo (GE) STIR T2-weighting sequences in sagittal, dorsal and transverse planes, with a magnet of 0.2 Tesla. The bony and articular structures were identified and labelled on anatomical dissections, as well as on the magnetic resonance (MR) images. RESULTS: MR images showed the bone, articular cartilage, menisci and ligaments of the normal tiger stifle. SE T1-weighted sequence provided excellent resolution of the subchondral bones of the femur, tibia and patella compared with the GE STIR T2-weighted MR images. Articular cartilage and synovial fluid were visualised with high signal intensity in GE STIR T2-weighted sequence, compared with SE T1-weighted sequence where they appeared with intermediate intensity signal. Menisci and ligaments of the stifle joint were visible with low signal intensity in both sequences. The infrapatellar fat pad was hyperintense on SE T1-weighted images and showed low signal intensity on GE STIR T2-weighted images. CONCLUSIONS: MRI provided adequate information of the bony and soft tissues structures of Bengal tiger stifle joints. This information can be used as initial anatomic reference for interpretation of MR stifle images and to assist in the diagnosis of diseases of this region."

This synaptopathy is characterized by an imbalance between glutamatergic and GABAergic transmission and has been proposed to be a potential therapeutic target. Siponimod (BAF312), a selective sphingosine 1-phosphate1,5 receptor modulator, is currently under investigation in a clinical trial in secondary progressive MS patients. We investigated whether siponimod, in addition to its peripheral immune modulation, may exert direct neuroprotective effects in the central nervous system (CNS) of mice with chronic progressive EAE. METHODS: Minipumps allowing continuous intracerebroventricular (icv) infusion of siponimod for 4 weeks were implanted into C57BL/6 mice subjected to MOG35-55-induced EAE. Electrophysiology, immunohistochemistry, western blot, qPCR experiments, and peripheral lymphocyte counts were performed. In addition, the effect of siponimod on activated microglia was assessed in vitro to confirm the direct effect of the drug on CNS-resident immune cells. RESULTS: Siponimod administration (0.45 mug/day) induced a significant beneficial effect on EAE clinical scores with minimal effect on peripheral lymphocyte counts. Siponimod rescued defective GABAergic transmission in the striatum of EAE, without correcting the EAE-induced alterations of glutamatergic transmission. We observed a significant attenuation of astrogliosis and microgliosis together with reduced lymphocyte infiltration in the striatum of EAE mice treated with siponimod. Interestingly, siponimod reduced the release of IL-6 and RANTES from activated microglial cells in vitro, which might explain the reduced lymphocyte infiltration. Furthermore, the loss of parvalbumin-positive (PV+) GABAergic interneurons typical of EAE brains was rescued by siponimod treatment, providing a plausible explanation of the selective effects of this drug on inhibitory synaptic transmission. CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, our results show that siponimod has neuroprotective effects in the CNS of EAE mice, which are likely independent of its peripheral immune effect, suggesting that this drug could be effective in limiting neurodegenerative pathological processes in MS."

Overexpression of RNPC1 increased, whereas knockdown of RNPC1 decreased, the level of PR protein and transcripts. Additionally, we demonstrated that RNPC1 could bind to PR mRNA via AU-rich elements (AREs) within PR 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) and then enhance PR mRNA stability.

Here, we review the interplay between six well-known RBPs (TTP, AUF-1, KSRP, HuR, TIA-1, and TIAR) that recognize AU-rich elements (AREs) at the 3' untranslated regions of mRNAs, namely ARE-RBPs. Examples of the links between their cross-regulations and modulation of their targets are analyzed during mRNA processing, turnover, localization, and translational control. Furthermore, ARE recognition can be self-regulated by several factors that lead to the prevalence of one RBP over another. Consequently, we examine the factors that modulate the dynamics of those protein-RNA transient interactions to better understand the final consequences of the regulation mediated by ARE-RBPs. For instance, factors controlling the RBP isoforms, their conformational state or their post-translational modifications (PTMs) can strongly determine the fate of the protein-RNA complexes. Moreover, mRNA specific sequence and secondary structure or subtle environmental changes are also key determinants to take into account. To sum up, the whole understanding of such a fine tuned regulation is a challenge for future research and requires the integration of all the available structural and functional data by in vivo, in vitro and in silico approaches."

Despite having a large functional overlap in OA onset and development, the mechanism of IL1beta and WNT crosstalk has remained largely unknown. In this study, we have used a combination of computational modeling and molecular biology to reveal direct or indirect crosstalk between these pathways. Specifically, we revealed a mechanism by which IL1beta upregulates WNT signaling via downregulating WNT antagonists, DKK1 and FRZB. In human chondrocytes, IL1beta decreased the expression of Dickkopf-1 (DKK1) and Frizzled related protein (FRZB) through upregulation of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), thereby activating the transcription of WNT target genes. This effect could be reversed by iNOS inhibitor 1400W, which restored DKK1 and FRZB expression and their inhibitory effect on WNT signaling. In addition, 1400W also inhibited both the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression and cytokine-induced apoptosis. We concluded that iNOS/NO play a pivotal role in the inflammatory response of human OA through indirect upregulation of WNT signaling. Blocking NO production may inhibit the loss of the articular phenotype in OA by preventing downregulation of the expression of DKK1 and FRZB."

Aspirin (150 mg, nocte) was prescribed to women who were identified through a screening program at 11-13+6 weeks' gestation as being at high risk for developing early-onset preeclampsia. Women who were at low risk for developing preeclampsia did not receive aspirin. The prevalence of PPRoM was compared with an observational cohort.Results: In the observational cohort, there were 3027 women, including 32 (1.1%) cases of PPRoM. The prevalence of PPRoM in the high risk group was 3.1% (4/128) and was statistically significantly higher compared to the low risk group (1.0%) (28/2899). The relative risk was 3.02 (95% CI 1.2-7.7; p= .04). In the interventional cohort, there were 7280 women, with 114 (1.6%) cases of PPRoM. The prevalence of PPRoM in the high risk group who were treated with aspirin was 1.8% (14/766) compared to 1.5% (100/6516) in the low risk group (p= .54). The prevalence of PPRoM in high risk patients in the observational group (who did not receive aspirin) compared with the high risk patients in the interventional group (who were treated with aspirin) was not statistically significant (p= .31).Conclusions: PPRoM is significantly associated with a description of high risk for ePET; although, this algorithm is not a good screening tool for predicting PPRoM. Aspirin treatment of women deemed high risk for ePET is safe in the context of PPRoM and there may be some reduction in prevalence of PPRoM in treated high risk women; although, this study was not powered to demonstrate a small reduction in the prevalence of PPRoM.

Uterine fibroids are the most common benign tumors found in women. In 20%-50% of women, fibroids are asymptomatic and do not require any treatment. The main symptoms of uterine fibroids are profuse menstrual bleeding, abnormal uterine bleeding, and pressure symptoms. Pressure symptoms can cause pelvic pain syndrome, urination disorders, and constipation. The treatment methods that are currently used include surgical treatment, pharmacological therapy, and minimally invasive procedures. The most commonly applied minimally invasive method is the embolization of uterine arteries. This procedure is currently a widely accepted method of treatment for symptomatic uterine fibroids and has been recognized as such by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence in the guidelines for heavy menstrual bleeding. This is a complicated procedure and requires close cooperation between gynecologists and interventional radiologists. We present a protocol applicable to uterine artery embolization in the treatment of symptomatic uterine fibroids. The protocol is divided into five section. The first two section are intended for gynecologists and interventional radiologists, explaining how to qualify and prepare a patient for embolization in a step-by-step manner. Section three, which is directed at interventional radiologists, explains how embolization should be done. Section four is directed at gynecologists or hospital ward doctors who look after the patients after embolization. This section of the protocol offers a method for treating post-embolization pain using the Patient Controlled Analgesia (PCA) pump. Section five completes the procedure with an assessment of the effects and late complications of uterine artery embolization. All five section create a uniform protocol directed at clinicians, experts, and researchers new to the field."

        "text": "Upfront rational therapy in BRAF V600E mutated pediatric ameloblastoma promotes ad integrum mandibular regeneration.\nAmeloblastoma is a neoplasm arising in the craniofacial skeleton. Proliferating odontogenic epithelial cells comprise this benign, yet locally invasive tumor, often causing severe disfiguration. High recurrence rate entails ablative surgical resection, which is the current standard of care, resulting in subsequent critical size osteocutaneous defects. The high incidence of BRAF mutations in ameloblastoma, most notably the BRAF V600E mutation, enabled the use of BRAF inhibiting agent in a neoadjuvant setting. In this investigator-initiated, open-label study, three consecutive pediatric patients, with confirmed BRAF V600E ameloblastoma deemed marginally resectable, were treated with BRAF inhibiting agents, prior to undergoing surgery. The use of upfront BRAF inhibitor treatment resulted in substantial tumor regression, allowing for non-mutilating complete surgical removal, ad integrum bone regeneration and organ preservation. All patients showed a marked radiologic and clinical response to medical treatment, enabling successful conservative surgery. Microscopically, all patients showed evidence of minimal residual tumor with extensive tumor necrosis, fibrosis and generation of new bone. At a median follow-up of 31 months, all patients remained free of disease. Face preservation therapy was achieved in pediatric patients presenting with BRAF V600E mutated ameloblastoma. Our study demonstrates the translational potential of targeted therapy as a neoadjuvant agent. Patient-specific organ preservation therapy should be considered as the new standard of care in ameloblastoma, mainly for children and adolescents."

        "text": "The impact of mucormycosis (black fungus) on SARS-CoV-2-infected patients: at a glance.\nThe emergence of various diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic made health workers more attentive, and one of the new pathogens is the black fungus (mucormycosis). As a result, millions of lives have already been lost. As a result of the mutation, the virus is constantly changing its traits, including the rate of disease transmission, virulence, pathogenesis, and clinical signs. A recent analysis revealed that some COVID-19 patients were also coinfected with a fungal disease called mucormycosis (black fungus). India has already categorized the COVID-19 patient black fungus outbreak as an epidemic. Only a few reports are observed in other countries. The immune system is weakened by COVID-19 medication, rendering it more prone to illnesses like black fungus (mucormycosis). COVID-19, which is caused by a B.1.617 strain of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has been circulating in India since April 2021. Mucormycosis is a rare fungal infection induced by exposure to a fungus called mucormycete. The most typically implicated genera are Mucor rhyzuprhizopusdia and Cunninghamella. Mucormycosis is also known as zygomycosis. The main causes of infection are soil, dumping sites, ancient building walls, and other sources of infection (reservoir words \"mucormycosis\" and \"zygomycosis\" are occasionally interchanged). Zygomycota, on the other hand, has been identified as polyphyletic and is not currently included in fungal classification systems; also, zygomycosis includes Entomophthorales, but mucormycosis does not. This current review will be focused on the etiology and virulence factors of COVID-19/mucormycosis coinfections in COVID-19-associated mucormycosis patients, as well as their prevalence, diagnosis, and treatment."

        "text": "Structural Gynecological Disease: Fibroids, Endometriosis, Ovarian Cysts.\nFibroids, endometriosis, and ovarian cysts are common conditions. Fibroids can be asymptomatic or present with heavy menstrual bleeding, pelvic pressure, and pain. Endometriosis is a common cause of cyclical pelvic pain. Ovarian cysts are generally diagnosed incidentally. Transvaginal ultrasound is the performed imaging modality for all structural gynecological disease. Symptomatic management is recommended for each condition. Fibroids can be managed medically or surgically depending on the patient's symptoms and desire for future fertility. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are the first-line therapy for endometriosis followed by oral contraceptives and surgical management. Ovarian cysts can be managed expectantly."

        "text": "Latent EBV impairs immune cell signaling and enhances the efficacy of anti-CD3 mAb in Type 1 Diabetes.\nTeplizumab has been approved for the delay of the onset of type 1 diabetes and may modulate new onset disease. We found that patients who were EBV positive at baseline had a more robust response to drug in two clinical trials and therefore postulated that latent virus has general effects in modifying immune responses. We compared the phenotypes, transcriptomes, and development of peripheral blood cells before and after teplizumab treatment. Higher number of Tregs and partially exhausted CD8 + T cells were found in EBV seropositive individuals at the baseline in the TN10 trial and AbATE trial. Single cell transcriptomics and functional assays identified downregulation of the T cell receptor and other signaling pathways before treatment. Impairments in function of adaptive immune cells were enhanced by teplizumab treatment in EBV seropositive individuals. Our data indicate that EBV can impair signaling pathways generally in immune cells, that broadly redirect cell differentiation."
